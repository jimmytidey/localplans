 Preparation of the Local Plan  
1.1 The purpose of planning is to help achieve sustainable development.  This means ensuring that prov iding for 
the development needs of the current generation does not worsen the lives of future generations.  The National 
Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) sets out how local councils should achieve this through the preparation of Local 
Plans and decisions o n planning applications, having regard to the economic, social and environmental roles of 
sustainable development.  
 
1.2 The Government requires that Local Plans are ‘sound’, meaning that they are:  
  
 • Positively prepared  
 • Justified  
 • Effective  
 • Cons istent with national policy  
 
1.3 The preparation of the Mid Devon Local Plan 2013 -2033 has been guided by national planning policy and 
legislation in this respect.  The plan sets out the strategic policies for development, identifies sites for housing, 
employment, infrastructure and environmental protection, and provides general policies on matters such as the design 
of development.  
 
1.4 This Local Plan supersedes and replaces the following earlier plans:  
  
 • Core Strategy 2026 (adopted 2007)  
 • Allocation s and Infrastructure Development Plan Document (adopted 2010)  
 • Local Plan Part 3: Development Management Policies (adopted 2013)  
 
 
1.5 The Mid Devon Local Plan also forms part of the Development Plan for the district, alongside Devon County 
Council’s Was te and Minerals Local Plans.  
 
1.6 National planning policy sets the planning framework within which the Local Plan Review has been prepared.  
The National  Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) was originally introduced in March 2012 and replaced multiple 
nation al policy statements and guidance with an overarching planning policy document.  The NPPF requires local 
planning authorities to base local plans on adequate, up -to-date and relevant evidence about the economic, social and 
environmental characteristics and prospects of the area. Assessments of and strategies for housing, employment and 
other uses should be integrated, taking full account of relevant market and economic signals. In May 2014 the 
Government launched web -based planning practice guidance that bro ught together supporting planning guidance 
entirely on -line in  an accessible and useable way.  
 
1.7 Most importantly, the NPPF applies a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’.  For plan -making 
this means:  
• Local planning authorities should pos itively seek opportunities to meet the development needs of their 
area;  
• Local Plans should meet objectively assessed needs, with sufficient flexibility  to adap t to rapid 
change, unless:  
-  any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstra bly outweigh the benefits, 
when assessed against the policies in the NPPF  taken as a whole; or  
-  specific policies in the NPPF indicate development should be restricted (for example, 
restrictions on development affecting Sites of Special  Scientific Intere st, Areas of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty, designated  heritage assets or areas at risk of flooding).  
 3 
 1.8 The NPPF goes on to provide national policy on all areas of planning for development, such as design, 
transport, employment growth and the conservation  of environmental and heritage assets.  Before it can be adopted, a 
Local Plan must be subject to Examination in Public.  The Planning Inspector applies tests of ‘soundness’, one of 
which refers to the plan’s consistency with national policy.  In addition,  a Local Plan must be positively prepared, 
justified and effective, and the NPPF defines the meaning of these terms.  Under ‘transitional arrangements’ introduced 
alongside recent revisions to the NPPF, the Local Plan Review has been examined under the orig inal 2012 version of 
the NPPF.  
 
1.9 There is no longer a regional tier of planning policy in the form of a Regional Spatial Strategy.  However, the 
Heart of the South West Local Economic Partnership (HotSW) has prepared a Strategic Economic Plan which has a 
bearing on strategic planning in Mid Devon.  
 
1.10 Whilst national planning policy provides the planning framework within which a plan is to be prepared, the 
document has also been prepared in accordance with a regulatory framework set down by the EU requ iring that the 
environmental impact of a plan be assessed.  UK regulations take this a step further, requiring local planning 
authorities to also consider the social and economic impact of a plan in an environmental report when a Local Plan is 
submitted to  the Secretary of State for Examination in Public, and subsequently adopted.  Considering these three key 
elements together is central to assessing the sustainability of a plan.  A Sustainability Appraisal has been carried out 
during the preparation of thi s Local Plan in order to gain an understanding of the sustainability challenges the district 
faces.  
 
1.11 Local Authorities are also required to undertake a Habitat Regulations Assessment (HRA) of development 
plans.  The HRA for the Mid Devon Local Plan Re view considers the impact of the Plan on European sites either 
alone or in combination with other plans. European sites include Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) designated for 
species and habitats and Special Protected Areas (SPAs) designed for birds. Consideration is also provided to 
potential SPAs, candidate SACs, Sites of Community Importance and Ramsar sites.  The HRA concludes that the 
development proposed in the Local Plan alone , and in combination with other plans and projects, will not result in 
adverse effects on the integrity of European Sites around Mid Devon . The Sustainability Appraisal carried out during 
the preparation of the Local Plan has taken into account the findings of the HRA.  
 
1.12 Furthermore, the Equalities Act 2010 requires Local  Authorities to eliminate discrimination and promote 
equality when producing a Local Plan and Policies. An Equalities Impact Assessment has been carried out to assess 
each policy and site allocation against five policy areas which have taken into account t he ‘protected characteristics’ 
as set out in the Equalities Act. Policies have evolved and altered throughout the Local Plan Review process to reduce 
discrimination and promote equality.  
 
1.13 The process of preparing the Local Plan and the Sustainability Appraisal has helped develop a picture of the 
district, its characteristics, constraints and sustainability issues.  In particular Mid Devon is defined by:  
 •  An inland district covering an area of 352 square miles, lying between Dartmoor, Exmoor and the 
Blackdown Hills  
 •  One of the most sparsely populated local autho rities in England and Wales with a high proportion of    
residents living outsi de the three market towns of Tiverton, Cullompton and Crediton  
 •  Important transport routes cross cut the dis trict, including the M5 motorway and A361, and the Great 
Western mainline railway  
  •  A population of 79,800  (2016 Devon County Council PPSA Estimates ) 
 •  High house prices compared with local wage levels, resulting in low levels of affordability (in lin e with 
a pattern which applies across the region and nationally)  
 •  Low levels of inward commuting but high out commuting , particularly to  Exeter and Taunton  
 •  High and increasing levels of car ownership  
 •  12 Sites of Special Scientific Interest, thre e Local Nature Reserves, two nature reserves managed by 
Devon Wildlife Trust a nd over 8 square kilometres of ancient woodland  
 •  Rich historic environment including over 2000 listed buildings, 51 Conservation Areas, 49 Scheduled 
Monuments, 3 registered pa rks and gardens and 16 locally  important parks and gardens  
 •  Small areas of social deprivation within Tiverton, Cullompton and some of the remote rural areas  4 
  
1.14 These characteristics and sustainability issues, and a range of other important issues wh ich have informed 
the content of the plan, are discussed in greater detail in the accompanying Sustainability Appraisal (SA).  The Local 
Plan has been prepared in response to these issues, seeking to deliver development in a sustainable manner, whilst 
respecting environmental limits.  The SA charts this development process, reflecting how the plan has been put 
together following previous consultations and the production of evidence.  
 
Vision and Spatial Strategy  
 
Vision  
 
1.15 The vision (in conjunction with the spatial strategy ) describe s how the sustainable development of Mid Devon 
will bring positive benefits to local communities through promoting community well -being, supporting economic 
success, conserving and enhancing the area and respecting environment al limits:  
 
Mid Devon will be a prosperous and sustainable rural district, where individuals, families and communities can flourish 
as a result of access to good quality local employment, housing and services and a clean, green, safe environment. 
Local com munities and private, public and voluntary organisations will work in partnership to meet social and 
economic needs in ways that enhance the environment and reduce the area’s carbon footprint. High quality 
development in the right places with appropriate i nfrastructure will bring regeneration, social and economic benefits 
and enhance towns, villages and countryside while promoting sustainable use of energy and other resources and 
tackling the causes and effects of climate change. The Council will use planni ng and related powers to:  
 
 
Promote community well -being  
 
 • Diverse, inclusive communities with a vibrant mix of accessible uses  and local services  
 • Sufficient ‘fit for purpose’, decent homes which people can afford  
 • Safe, healthy and crime free neigh bourhoods  
 • Active, involved, well -educated citizens  
 • A good range of opportunities to travel by active and sustainable modes  
 • Strong town and village communities  
 • Green Infrastructure for personal leisure amenity space  
 
Support sustainable economi c success  
 
 • A good range of jobs in urban and rural areas  
 • Growth that respects Mid Devon’s relationship with Exeter and Taunton  
 • Profitable and expanding local businesses, attracting inward investment  
 • Attractive, lively and successful town centr es 
 • Tourism and leisure enterprises that benefit the whole district  
 • Recognition of the role of heritage as a tourism attraction  
 
Conserve and enhance the area  
 
 • High quality design in new developments  
 • Clean air and water  
 • Countryside, environm ent and heritage assets conserved and enhanced  
 • Attractive countryside providing for biodiversity and employment  
 • Effective reuse of existing buildings   5 
  • Conservation and enhan cement of protected landscapes  
 
Respect environmental limits  
 
 • Social and environmental benefits of development are optimised  
 • Developments use land, energy and resources effectively  
 • Waste is minimised and recycling rates are high  
 • Public transport, walking and cycling are encouraged  
 • Floodplains remain undeveloped  
 • Renewable energy projects within environmental limits   
 
Spatial Strategy  
 
Overall Strategy  
 
In order to move towards achieving the vision, development will be managed to:  
 
 • Create a prosperous economy which increases inward investment into the distri ct 
• Meet objectively assessed needs for development, guided to locations which  are or can be made   
sustainable, achieving a suitable balance of housing, employment, facilities and other uses within 
towns, villages, neighbourhoods and rural areas  
 • Reduc e the need to travel by car, increasing the potential of public transport, cycling and walking  
 • Reduce carbon emissions in support of national targets  
• Promote social inclusion and reduce inequalities by enhancing access for all to employment, services 
and housing  
 
Cullompton  
 
In the medium to long term, the market town of Cullompton will become the strategic focus of new development, 
reflecting its accessibility, economic potential and environmental capacity.  
 
 Development will be targeted to:  
 
• Provid e sustainable urban extensions containing a  mix of fit for purpose homes, businesses, local 
shopping and other services and sustainable transport links  
• Provide enhancements to the town centre through additional investment,  traffic and transport 
improvem ents and environmental enhancements to provide a significant boost to its vitality and 
viability , provide for a better range of retail and other uses and a  significantly improved visitor 
environment  
 • Develop any remaining underused brownfield sites withi n the town  
 • Protect and enhance the key environmen tal assets including heritage, biodiversity and air quality  
 
Other Market Towns  
 
The market towns of Tiverton and Crediton w ill be the secondary focuses of new development, in scale with their 
individual infrastructures, economies, characters and constraints.  
 
 Development will be targeted to:  
 
• Provide a sustainable mix of fit for purpose homes, businesses, shops, leisure, health, education and                           
many other uses, to resolve existi ng problems where feasible and to meet rural needs  6 
 • Protect and enhance their environmental assets including their character, biodiversity, heritage, 
setting and air quality  
• Develop underused and brownfield sites within the towns in preference to  greenf ield land or public 
open spaces  
• Enhance town centres as accessible, vital and viable locations for a vibrant  mix of uses, and as public 
transport hubs  
 
Junction 27, M5 Motorway  
 
Regionally significant transport infrastructure linkages and acts as a gatew ay to the South West Peninsula.  
 
Development will be targeted to:  
 
•  Provide a high quality tourist and leisure focused development to meet needs  identified within the 
tourism study.  
• Associated outlet/discounted retail floorspace to meet a regional comp arison  floorspace need and 
deliver the tourist and leisure elements of the allocation. Safeguarding existing town centres through 
planning controls.  
 • Ensuring enhanced linkages to Tiverton and C ullompton and the National Rail Network.  
 • Mitigating envir onmental impacts.  
 • Upgrading directly affected transport infrastructure.  
 
Villages  
 
A network of villages with sufficient services and public transport provision will be locations for limited development, 
targeted to:  
 
• Provide for housing, shops, local  services, community facilities and low impact businesses, at a scale 
commensurate with that of the existing village  
 • Avoid significantly increased travel by car  
• Protect and enhance their environmental assets,  including their character, biodiversity, h eritage and        
setting  
 
Countryside  
 
Development in countryside areas outside defined towns and villages, including hamlets and other small settlements, 
will be targeted to:  
 
 • Meet agricultural and other rural business needs  
 • Promote environmental enhancement including landscape and biodiversity  
 • Encourage appropriate economic diversification to support the rural  economy  
 • Provide infrastructure to meet the needs of the community  
 
1.16 The Council has considered what strategic approaches are avai lable to meet the vision for sustainable 
development which has been carried forward from the previous Core Strategy and which continues to reflect the 
national policy provisions for sustainable development.  In particular, the NPPF requires that councils m ake significant 
efforts to meet the objectively assessed development needs for their area in their Local Plans.  Environmental 
constraints at Tiverton and Crediton mean that a new approach to the strategic distribution of development is required 
in this Lo cal Plan Review.  Some provision in the more sustainable villages is now proposed, but a wider distribution of 
housing in these smaller settlements risks significant increases in unsustainable travel.  The possibility of a new 
settlement in the vicinity of  Willand was examined but found to be both inappropriate and likely to be unachievable.  
Cullompton has more limited environmental constraints than the other market towns and long term growth potential to 7 
 the east of the town.  Cullompton Town Council is s upportive of increased growth rates, reflecting the importance they 
attach to the economic renaissance of the town and in particular the town centre.  Given these constraints, and the 
lack of feasibility of a new settlement led approach to strategic growth , Cullompton is the appropriate long term focus 
of the district’s growth.  The Council understands significant potential infrastructure constraints to this growth will need 
to be overcome, but by providing certainty to the long term planning policy of the area, the Council will be in a position 
to work towards overcoming these constraints.  Further details are set out in strategic policy S11 Cullompton and in 
the Cullompton section of Chapter 3.0, Site Allocations.  
 
Neighbourhood planning  
 
1.17 The Localism  Act 2011 devolved planning powers to local communities.  A town or parish council designated 
as a neighbourhood forum can produce a neighbourhood plan, neighbourhood development order or community right 
to build order.  
 
1.18 A neighbourhood plan must be consistent with the strategic planning policies of the district council, national 
planning policy and human rights legislation.  A Sustainability Appraisal and Strategic Environmental Assessment may 
also be required.  The plan is then subject to independen t examination and a referendum.  If it succeeds at 
referendum, a neighbourhood plan becomes part of the Mid Devon Development Plan and a statutory consideration in 
planning decisions.   
 
1.19 Depending on its scope, the preparation of a neighbourhood plan can be a complex and time -consuming 
process, requiring a certain amount of technical expertise.  The Council will support local communities wishing to 
pursue neighbourhood planning.  Cullompton, Crediton , Silverton and Tiverton  were the first to initiate n eighbourhood 
planning in Mid Devon.  
 
1.20 More information on neighbourhood planning and other community rights can be found on the Mid Devon  
website .

 Sustainable development principles   
 
The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) is clear that the purpose of the planning system is to contribute to 
the achievement of susta inable development.  
 
The NPPF  (2012)  states that: “There are three distinct dimensions to sustainable development: economic, social and 
environmental. These dimensions give rise to the need for the planning system to perform a number of roles:   
 
• an econ omic role  – contributing to building a strong, responsive and competitive economy, by ensuring that 
sufficient land of the right type is available in the right places and at the right time to support growth and innovation; 
and by identifying and coordinati ng development requirements, including the provision of infrastructure;  
• a social role  – supporting strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by providing the supply of housing 
required to meet the needs of present and future generations; and by creating a  high quality built environment, with 
accessible local services that reflect the community’s needs and support its health, social and cultural well -being; and  
• an environmental role – contributing to protecting and enhancing our natural, built and histori c environment; 
and, as part of this, helping to improve biodiversity, use natural resources prudently, minimise waste and pollution, 
and mitigate and adapt to climate change including moving to a low carbon economy. ” 
 
The NPPF (2012)  clarif ies that “These roles should not be undertaken in isolation because they are mutually 
dependent” and:   
 
Pursuing sustainable development involves seeking positive improvements in the quality of the built, natural and 
historic environment, as well as in people’s quality of  life, including (but not limited to):  
 
• Making it easier for jobs to be created in cities, towns and villages;  
• Moving from a net loss of biodiversity to achieving net gains for nature;  
• Replacing poor design with better design;  
• Improving the conditi ons in which people  live, work, travel and take leisure; and  
• Widening the choice of high quality homes.  
 
Therefore to achieve sustainable development, economic, social and environmental gains should be sought jointly and 
simultaneously through the plann ing system. This Local Plan takes into account local circumstances to achieve 
sustainable development in Mid Devon.  16 
 Overall provision of housing  and employment  
 
2.1 The Local Plan Review sets out the levels of development required over the period 2013 -2033.  This takes 
account of the Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2015), the Employment Land Review (2013) and the Retail 
Study (2012), all of which provide technical advice on the levels of need and demand for development in Mid Devon.  
The documents ca n be viewed on the Council’s website.  
 
Housing  
 
2.1a National policy requires that the Council uses its evidence (known as a Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment, or SHMA) to ensure that the Local Plan meets the full, objectively assessed needs for housing , and that 
planning for housing is considered over Housing Market Areas. The most recent SHMA for the Exeter Housing Market 
Area (incorporating Mid Devon, along with Exeter, East Devon and Teignbridge) published 2015, sets out the 
Objectively Assessed Need  for Mid Devon and the remainder of the HMA.  
 
2.1b  The SHMA sets out the housing need range for Mid Devon of 359 – 381. Further explanation is given in the 
SHMA document. This Local Plan sets a housing target of 393 dwellings, above the housing need range  set in the 
SHMA to ensure that housing provision in the plan is consistent with the additional need arising from job creation at 
Junction 27 of the M5. The SHMA concludes that there is no need for further upward adjustment to reflect market 
signals or oth er such factors.  
 
2.2  7,860  dwellings are required over the plan period, equating to 393 dwellings per year.  The following table 
sets out the situation at 31st March 2018  indicating a remaining need for about 3,512  dwellings  to be allocated.  
 
Local Plan requirement  7,860  
Completions since 2013  1,730  
Commitments (dwellings under construction or 
with planning permission)  2,618  
Uncommitted requirement  3,512

 2.4 The Local Plan makes provision for 17%  more housing than is r equired, to provide flexibility and account for 
unforeseen circumstances that might prevent some sites from coming forward as expecte d such as not all 
commitments translating into completions .  The availability of land for housing, taking account of existing commitments 
and allocations is set out in the following trajectory.  The development of allocated sites in Tiverton and Crediton w ill 
diminish in the latter part of the plan period, while Cullompton’s role in meeting the district’s long -term housing need is 
reflected in the town’s forecast housing delivery up to 2033.  Allocations in Crediton and rural areas will help to bolster 
hous ing supply in the first five years of the plan, allowing a sufficient lead -in period for the larger town sites, which 
have more complex infrastructure and Masterplanning requirements.  These trajectories assume that housing will 
come forward at the earlies t opportunity but it is largely the housing market that determines housing delivery and it is 
possible that sites will be delivered at different times and rates from those forecast.  Also, windfall developments will 
continue to come forward throughout the plan period and these are not included in the trajectories.

 2.5 The availability, suitability and achievability of the sites have been assessed during the Local Plan’s 
preparation, through the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) in accordance with national policy 
and guidance.  The Council is therefore confident that they can and will deliver sufficient housing to meet Mid Devon’s 
requirements.  Delivery of housing will be monitored continuously with information published annually in the Authority’s 
Monitoring Report.   Where performance falls significantly below the development targets and the Council is no longer 
able to demonstrate a five year supply of housing in accordance with national policy, the Council will take action as set 
out in Policy S4.  The Local Plan will be reviewed and new sites identified if strategic sites in this plan fail to come 
forward.  
 
2.6 The following table illustrates the requi rement for five years’ supply of housing.  This is adjusted annually to 
take account of how many houses have been built since the beginning of the plan period (2013), with any shortfall 
included in the requirement for the next five years.  
 
A Local Plan req uirement 2013 -2033 7,860  
B Implied annual rate 2013 -2033 (A ÷ 20)  393 
C Local Plan requirement to date, 2013 -2018 (B * 5)  1,965  
D Completions April 2013 -March 20 18 1,730  
E Shortfall to date, 2013 -2018 (C – D) 235 
F Local Plan requirement 2018 -2023 (B  * 5) 1,965  
 
G 5 year supply requirement (E + F)  2,200  
 
Table 7: Five year housing requirement    
 
2.7 Over the entire plan period (2013 -2033) there is provision for 17% more housing than required, as explained 
in paragraph 2.4. Within certain year brack ets, such as 2023/24 -2027/28  and 2028/29 -2032/33 , this is substantially 
higher, as shown in the table below. The table indicates that even applying a 20% buffer in the short term, there is 
flexibility in the plan to ensure sufficient housing will come forw ard for the Council to demonstrate a five year supply in 
accordance with national policy.   
 
 2018/19 -2022/23  2023/24 -2027/28  2028/29 -2032/33

Table 8: Housing supply in five year tranches   
 
2.8 All the housing  sites in the Local Plan have been subject to the Strategic Housing Land Availability 
Assessment and have been deemed to be deliverable.  However, the plan has to be able to deal with uncertainty, 
reflecting that  changes in the housing market or other circumstances may prevent allocated sites from being delivered 
at the rate the Council has forecast.  The Local Plan deals with this uncertainty in three ways.  
 
Extra provision  
 
2.9 The Local Plan makes provision for 1,374  dwellings over and ab ove the identified requirement.  
 
 20 
 Windfalls  
2.10 Windfalls are dwellings that come forward on sites that are not allocated.  Other than windfalls included in the 
figures for existing committed sites (those under construction or  with planning permission), the Local Plan makes no 
allowance for windfalls likely to occur in the plan period.  However, it is highly likely that trends in windfall development  
will continue, and the Council’s annual update of the district’s housing suppl y will take account of windfall 
developments if and when appropriate.  When including windfalls, the Council will assume a minimum of 129 
dwellings per year, which  is calculated in line with the most recently published version of the Exeter housing market 
area Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (HELAA) methodology (April 2017) .     
 
Contingency sites  
 
2.11 The Local Plan allocates one ‘contingency site’ for housing.  This development will only be permitted if 
housing delivery across the distr ict falls below defined ‘action levels’ or the Council is unable to demonstrate a five 
year housing supply in accordance with national policy.  The release of the contingency site will be the Council’s 
preference if the supply of housing is insufficient, b ut proposals on other sites will also be considered on their merits 
according to the presumption in favour of sustainable development set out in national policy.    
 
Commercial development  
 
2.12 The Local Plan sets targets for commercial development, which can include traditional employment uses (B1 -
B8 use classes) such as offices, industrial development and storage and distribution, and also a range of other 
commercial uses such as retail, leisure and hospitality.  Site allocation policies set out the uses considered acceptable 
in a certain location, but the Council maintains a flexible approach to employment development and will consider jobs 
creation as a supporting factor in any proposal.  Nevertheless, uncontrolled  retail and some other proposals in the 
wrong location can have serious adverse impacts on town centres and surrounding uses, so there will be careful 
consideration of these proposals on sites not allocated for such a use.  
 
2.13 Allocations for commercial development are consistent with the Loca l Plan strategy being broadly in 
accordance with the housing locations for significant long -term growth in Cullompton, short -medium term growth in 
Tiverton, and growth in Crediton and rural areas that is proportionate to their circumstances and environment al 
constraints.  The following table shows completions since 2013, existing commitments, (sites under construction and 
existing planning consents) and the amount of development allocated across Mid Devon. Figures are in square metres 
floorspace.

Totals  46,513   128,363   168,725 (87,662)  
  
Table 9:  Commercial land completions, commitments and allocations   
 
2.14 The Employment Land Review (2013) recommends the Council plan for 30 -40 hectares employment land, 
which is co nsidered equivalent to approximately 140,000 square metres floorspace.  The Retail Study (2012) identifies 
a limited need for non -food retail at around 7,000 square metres.  Taking this evidence into account, the Local Plan 21 
 sets a commercial development re quirement of 147,000 square metres, with allocations distributed as shown in Table 
9. 
 
2.15 To provide flexibility of provision and allow for growth, the Local Plan makes provision for more commercial 
floorspace than is required across the district’s sett lements . There is an excess of commercial land supply in the most 
sustainable locations – Tiverton and Cullompton – while Crediton is more constrained due to the limited availability of 
suitable land.  Rural areas are often not suitable for large -scale emp loyment growth, though windfall development in 
rural areas and on existing employment sites is likely to continue, given past performance and supportive Local Plan 
policies.  In addition the Local Plan makes provision for a further 29% commercial floorspac e at Junction 27 for a high 
quality tourist and leisure focussed development to meet needs identified within the tourism study.  The allocated sites 
have been subject to Strategic Commercial Land Availability Assessment (SCLAA) and are considered available,  
suitable and achievable.  In the event that circumstances change and a site is no longer viable for its designated use, 
the Council will consider alternative uses as set out in paragraph 2. 12 and Policy DM19 (protection of employment 
land).   
 
2.16 The fo llowing trajectory illustrates the expected annual provision of commercial development across the 
district, taking account of existing commitments and allocations.  The development of existing commitments is forecast 
to take seven years, spread evenly acro ss that period.  This takes account of slow historic rates of commercial 
develo pment in Mid Devon.  Cullompton’ s role in meeting the district’s long -term development needs is shown in the 
town’s forecast delivery up to 2033, while Tiverton’s commercial gro wth from allocated sites tails off with the 
completion of the Eastern Urban Extension.  The development of allocated sites in Crediton and rural areas may have 
been completed by the latter part of the plan period, but it is highly likely that windfall deve lopments will continue to 
come forward.

Sustainable development priorities  
  
The following strategic priorities outline what will need to be ach ieved to deliver the Vision and 
address the key issues that have been identified in Mid Devon. All development will be expected to 
support the creation of sustainable communities by:  
 
a) A development focus at Tiverton, Cullompto n and Crediton as Mid Devon ’s most sustainable 
settlements, with lon g-term growth to the east of Cullompton and a limited level of development in 
identified villages;  
b) Building a strong, competitive economy  through access to education, training and jobs, 
infrastructure, the creati on of new enterprise, economic regeneration and flexibility of uses to 
respond to changing circumstances;  
c) Ensuring the vitality of town centres and co mmunities through a hierarchy of centres, defined 
town centre shopping area s, a diverse retail offer at  Tiverton, Crediton and Cullompton, through 
controls on Junction 27 retail  and support for the vitality and viability of defined villages;  
d) Supporting a prosperous rural economy throu gh the conversion of suitable existing buildings and 
well-designe d new  buildings in suitable locations, diversification of agricultural and other land -
based businesses, support for equestrian activities, retention and development of local services 
and community facilities in vi llages, and the promotion of sustainable rural t ourism and leisure 
development;  
e) Promoting sustainable transport by deliverin g appropriate infrastructure, reducing the need to 
travel by car, integratin g public transport and other forms of sustainable travel such as walking 
and cycling, and providing s afe environments while recognising Mid Devon’s rural locality;  
f) Supporting high quality communications infras tructure by supporting the expansion of 
telecommunications and hi gh speed broadband throughout Mid Devon;  
g) Delivering a wide choice of high qua lity hom es through a diverse housing mix and by meeting the 
housing needs of all sectors of the communit y including the provision of accessible  housing for 
the elderly and disabled, those wishing to build their own home, aff ordable housing and gypsy 
and traveller pitches;  
h) Requiring good sustainable design that respects local character, heritage, surroundings and 
materials, creates safe and accessible environments, designs out crime and establishes a strong 
sense of place;  
i) Promoting healthy communitie s thro ugh the delivery of social, educational, recreational and 
cultural facilities and  services, access to high quality open space, public rights of way , 
recreational trails , accessible land and other green infrastructure,  and opportunities for sport and 
recreation and the designation of Local Green Space;   
j) Meeting the challenge of climate change by support ing a low carbon future, energy efficiency, 
increasing the use  and supply of renewable and low carbon energy, managing flood risk and 
conserving natu ral resources. Encourage the effective use of l and, taking into account the 
economic and other benefits of the best and  most versatile agricultural land;  
k) Conserving and enhancing the natur al environment by protecting and enhancing valued 
landscapes incl uding  the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Exmoor and 
Dartmoor Nat ional Parks, providing accessible green infrastructure, an d preventing significant 
harm to soil, air, water, noise and visual quality, in part icular air quality as a local  issue at 
Crediton and Cullompton;  
l) Minimising impacts on biodiversity and g eodiversity by recognising the wider benefits of 
ecosystems, del ivering natural environment objectives, providing a net gain in biodiversity and by 
the protection of internation al, European, national and local designated wildlife sites; and   23 
 m) Conserving and enhancing the h istoric environment through the identification and protection of 
designated and non -designated heritage assets and assessing th e impact of new development on 
the historic character of Mid Devon’s landscapes and townscapes.  
 
2.17 It is a legal requirement that Local Plans contribute to the achievement of sustainable development.  The 
Council will work in partnership with town and parish councils and other public bodies to ensure that all new 
development reinforces and delivers sustainable communities in line with guiding principles set out in Policy S1, which 
correspond to the vision and strategy for the district.  
 
2.18 The sustainable development priorities aim t o deliver varied and vibrant places by concentrating activities and 
facilities in accessible locations. The strategy aims to build a strong, competitive economy through inward investment 
and deliver a wide choice of high quality homes. Development will pro vide or utilise accessible green infrastructure 
networks including public open spaces, public rights of way, cycleways and other green linkages. Sustainable modes 
of transport include walking, cycling and public transport, though it is recognised that the private car will continue to 
play a significant role given the rural nature of Mid Devon.  The strategy requires good design which conserves and 
enhances the historic and natural environment, promotes healthy life styles and reduces pollution. The supply o f 
renewable energy should not be supported where it harms the special qualities of protected landscapes or their 
setting.  
 
2.19 The Council will monitor development to ensure that the Local Plan delivers sustainable development.   
 
Policy S2  
 
Amount and di stribution of development  
 
The diverse development needs of the community will be met through the provision of a minimum of 
7,860  dwellings and 147,000 square metres of commercial floorspace between 1st April 2013 and 31st 
March 2033.  
 
Development will be concentrated at Tiverton, Cullompton and Crediton, to a scale and mix 
appropriate to their individual infrastructures, economies, characters and constraints.  Other 
settlements will have more limited development which meets local needs and promotes vibrant  rural 
communities. In addition, development as proposed at Junction 27 of the M5 meets a tourism / leisure 
need in a location which is suitable for its regional role with a controlled retail element supporting the 
tourism and leisure aspects of the propos al.   
 
Development targets are approximately as follows:  
 
Location  Total Residential 
(commitments 
and allocations; 
dwellings)  Total Commercial 
(commitments 
and allocations; 
square metres)  
Tiverton  2,358  29,400  
Cullompton  3,930  73,500  
Crediton  786 14,700  
Rural areas  786 29,400  
Total 7,860  147,000  
 24 
 2.20 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA, 2015) identifies the amount and type of housing that 
should be provided in Mid Devon.  The target for commercial development is based on the Employment Land  Review 
(2013) and the Retail Study (2012).  Paragraphs 2.1 -2.16 explain how the allocations in the Local Plan will meet the 
development targets set out in Policy S2 above, while Policies S3 and S6 provide more detail on the types of housing 
and employment  to be delivered.  A summary of the SHMA outputs on housing need is contained in paragraphs 2.1a 
and 2.1b.  
 
2.21 Central to Policy S2 is the role of Cullompton in meeting the district’s long -term development needs.  This is a 
departure from historic planni ng strategy which focused the majority of development in Tiverton, commensurate with 
the size and sub -regional role of the town.  Available and suitable land for development in Tiverton has become 
increasingly scarce as the town has grown, whereas the expa nsion of Cullompton is both achievable and supported 
by the local community.  
 
2.22 National policy advises that planning should actively manage patterns of growth to make the fullest possible 
use of public transport, walking and cycling, and focus signific ant development in locations which are or can be made 
sustainable.  The largest allocation in the Local Plan is East Cullompton (Policies CU7 -CU12), which will have access 
onto the M5 motorway and deliver significant improvements to highways infrastructure  for the whole town.  The 
Council supports the reopening of a railway station at Cullompton and the Local Plan allocates a possible site for this.  
Pedestrian and cycle links to the town centre will be improved, and residents will be in close proximity to job 
opportunities within Cullompton and also at Willand, Tiverton and Exeter.  The concurrent development of the North 
West Cullompton Urban Extension will see a new road linking Tiverton Road to Willand Road, which will relieve traffic 
congestion in the t own centre, improving local air quality and the living conditions of residents. In addition, a new relief 
road to the east of the town centre will further improve local air quality by diverting north - and south -bound traffic away 
from Fore Street.  Signifi cant growth in Cullompton can be made sustainable through this investment in infrastructure, 
addressing long -standing issues of air quality and motorway junction capacity. New and expanded education facilities 
will also be provided within the town, to acco mmodate the impacts of new development.  
 
2.23 Tiverton will continue to expand through the development of the Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension (EUE) and 
a number of smaller sites.  The adopted EUE Masterplan proposes up to  1,520 dwellings and 30,000 square  metres 
commercial floorspace, with a new junction onto the A361, a new primary school and community facilities.   
 
2.24 Crediton is the smallest of Mid Devon’s market towns but serves a wide area in terms of employment, 
education and shopping.  The physic al constraints of Crediton limit the options for developable sites, and there are 
existing problems of traffic congestion through the town centre.  Air quality should improve following the opening of  the 
Crediton Link Road as a proportion of HGV and other traffic is drawn away from Exeter Road to the Lords Meadow 
Industrial Estate ; however the housing target for Crediton only amounts to 10% of the district total due to the traffic 
and topographical constraints that exist.   
 
2.25 Rural areas are expected to accommodate around 10% of the housing requirement for Mid Devon.  The Local 
Plan generally allocates small sites, the development of which will help to support the vitality of rural areas without 
harming their character or putting undue pressure on local i nfrastructure.  Commercial development in rural areas will 
come forward on non -allocated sites according to demand, enabled by supportive general policies, but the Local Plan 
also retains small employment allocations in Bampton and Willand as these sites a re already permitted or well -
connected to existing commercial uses and infrastructure.   
 
2.25a  In addition to the development targets as set out in the policy above, land at Junction 27 is  allocated for 
42,550 sqm of commercial floorspace to meet a touri sm/leisure need in a  location suitable for its regional role with a 
retail element supporting the tourism and leisure  aspects of the proposal. This will provide a high quality tourist and 
leisure focussed  development to meet needs identified within the tou rism study.  
 25 
 Housing 
 
Policy S3  
 
Meeting housing needs  
 
a) The diverse housing needs of Mid Devon will be met through the provision of a minimum of 7,860 
dwellings between 1st April 2013 and 31st March 2033. In line with the predicted continuing need 
for new housing the expected annual rate of new housing development will be 393 dwellings per 
annum;  
b) Unless otherwise stated in a site allocation policy, on open market housing sites (i.e. excluding 
exception sites provided under Rural Exception Sites under  policy DM6) of 11 dwellings or more 
in Tiverton, Cullompton and Crediton a target of 28% affordable dwellings, and on sites elsewhere 
of 6 dwellings or more a target of 30% affordable dwellings will be applied to the total number of 
dwellings, depending o n viability and providing a mix of dwelling sizes and types appropriate to 
the evolving needs of Mid Devon’s population.  Sites of between 6 – 10 dwellings outside 
Tiverton, Cullompton and Crediton will be permitted to make a financial contribution suffici ent to 
provide the affordable dwellings in another location;  
c) To support self -build and custom dwellings meeting the needs of local  communities , such 
dwellings will be permitted as affordable housing in locations outside settlement limits in 
accordance with Policy DM6;  
d) To support self -build and custom housing on sites of 20 dwellings or more developers will supply 
at least 5% of serviced dwelling plots for sale to self - builders for a period of 12 months per plot 
and any plots subsequently developed f or self -build must be completed within 3 years of 
purchase by a self -builder; and  
e) A five year supply of gypsy and traveller pitches will be allocated on deliverable sites within Mid 
Devon to ensure that the predicted need for traveller sites will be met . A further supply of 
developable sites or broad locations for growth will be identified equivalent to a further ten years 
of predicted growth.  The Housing Authority will seek to provide a public site for gypsy and 
traveller pitches within Mid Devon, subj ect to the availability of funding.  
 
2.26 As recognised in the National Pl anning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2012) “every effort should be made 
objectively to identify and then meet the  housing needs....of an area”.  To do this the Council has commissioned a 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)  in conjunction with other Councils to establish the level and types of 
housing need in Mid Devon. ‘Objectively Assessed Need’ (OAN) is determined by examining demographic projections, 
jobs-led population forecasts  and market signals which may affect housing need. The SHMA concludes that Mid 
Devon’s housing need falls between 359 and 381 dwellings per year.  This Local Plan sets a housing target of 393 
dwellings, above the housing need range set in the SHMA to ensure  that housing provision in the plan is consistent 
with the additional need arising from job creation at Junction 27 of the M5.  
 
2.27 The Council’s Corporate Plan  aims to “facilitate the housing growth that Mid Devon needs, including 
affordable housing” and  “ensure good design and quality of new housing and associated environment”.  The design 
policies in this plan will be utilised to achieve good quality housing for Mid Devon residents. The need for affordable 
housing has been established by the Strategic Ma rket Housing Assessment (SHMA). The SHMA concluded that 124 
units of affordable housing are needed per year to meet future needs arising in the district.  This is equivalent to about 
30% of the total housing need for Mid Devon.  This is reflected in the af fordable housing policy which requires 
development to meet this need by providing a proportion of dwellings as affordable on sites above the threshold. 
Additional affordable housing will also continue to come forward as windfalls resulting  from Homes Engla nd 
investment, exception sites and delivery of housing on Council -owned land.  26 
  
2.28 The application of the affordable housing policy is anticipated to deliver  over 2,000 affordable dwellings across 
the plan period, equating to approximately 30% of total ho using supply.  However it is recognised that the level of 
supply is unlikely to meet the anticipated need as not all allocations will come forward or others may be developed 
with a lower housing number than specified in the policy.  Furthermore, the Counci l has to consider the implications of 
meeting the need on the viability of new housing development.  Viability assessment work undertaken for the Council 
in relation to the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) has established that for the targets of 30% in rural areas and a 
target in the towns of 28% CIL charges of £60 and £40 respectively are viable.  However, as affordable housing is 
secured through planning obligations rather than CIL, the proportion to be provided onsite is negotiable and the 
Council may  accept financial contributions in lieu of onsite provision, which can result in a lower level of affordable 
housing delivery than anticipated.  Setting the affordable housing targets at the level proposed is therefore considered 
an appropriate balance bet ween meeting the majority of the need within the district, whilst ensuring the delivery of 
other important elements such as infrastructure, essential to achieve sustainable development over the plan period to 
2033.  
 
2.29 The SHMA forecasts a significant in crease in Mid Devon’s older population.  Given the resource demands 
associated with very elderly people, such as specially adapted bathrooms and the need for lifts, this is a significant 
figure.  Care homes or retirement complexes will be provided  through the development of strategic site allocations and 
other sites as they come forward.  The Building Regulations will also ensure that new housing meets certain 
requirements for adaptability and an ageing population.  As a result, there is no need for a specif ic policy target related 
to housing for older people.  
 
2.30 The Government is supporting the delivery of larger numbers of self -build and custom  homes through such 
measures as exempting such housing from the payment of CIL. For the purposes of CIL exempti on, ‘self -build’ is 
defined as all homes built or commissioned by individuals or groups of individuals for their own use.  The definition 
used in the Self -build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 is included in the glossary.  Local evidence suggests that 
there is a demand for such housing in Mid Devon in that approximately 2,000 people search online for self -build plots 
every year in Mid Devon and the Council’s Citizen’s Panel Survey (2013) shows that 12% of respondents were 
considering building their own hom e. Policy S3 therefore includes a requirement for 5% of plots on sites of 20 houses 
or more to be made available for purchase by self -builders. The self -build element will form part of the market 
dwellings available on the site, with the percentage applied  to the total number of properties on a site.  For example, a 
site of 100 dwellings, where a policy of 25% affordable housing applies, will provide 25 affordable dwellings and 75 
dwellings for sale on the open market, of which 5 of the latter would need to  be provided as plots for self -build.  Such 
plots will be marketed for a period of 12 months before being returned to the builder’s control.  The self -build property 
needs to be lived in as the owner’s principal residence for 3 years, as this is a conditio n of the exemption from CIL 
liability.   
 
2.31 As set out in the Government statement ‘Planning policy for traveller sites’ the government’s aim is to ensure 
fair and equal treatment for gypsies and travellers in a way that facilitates the traditional and nomadic way of life of 
travellers while respecting the interests of the settled community.  To achieve this aim the statement indicates that 
working collaboratively local planning authorities should make their own assessment of need for traveller sites and  
identify a five year supply of deliverable sites with a further ten year supply of developable sites or broad locations for 
growth on top of this. As a result a group of Councils within Devon commissioned a Gypsy and Traveller 
Accommodation Assessment (GT AA) to ascertain the need for gypsy, traveller and travelling showpeople pitch or plot 
requirements. This study indicated that between 2014 -34 within Mid Devon there is a need for 35 pitches for gypsies 
and travellers and 11 plots for travelling showpeople . The need for gypsy and traveller pitches will be accommodated 
by pitches within larger housing sites, for example at Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension, North West Cullompton, East 
Cullompton and Pedlerspool in Crediton.  The Council’s preferred approach is  for on -site provision as part of larger 
housing proposals TIV1, CU1, CU7 and CRE5. Provision off -site will only be accepted where it is demonstrated that 
provision on a different site would achieve a n acceptable outcome for Gypsies and Travellers as descr ibed in Policy 
DM7. Where such a n acceptable outcome can be demonstrated, off -site provision must meet the requirements of 
Policy DM7, and a mechanism must be put in place to ensure that the pitches are delivered. This will usually be 
through a s106 agreem ent requiring the developer to identify and obtain planning permission (which will not be 
unreasonably withheld by the Council) for the required number and standard of pitches. The pitches will be provided 27 
 by the development itself or where the land is tra nsferred for a nominal value, by an agreed third party Registered 
Provider or other agreed private provider, for the sole purpose of occupation and ancillary business by Gypsies and 
Travellers. The off -site provision of pitches must be provided and availab le for occupation before the occu pation of a 
specified proportion of on -site open market dwellings as part of the larger housing proposal at TIV1, CU1, CU7 or 
CRE5. Where the off -site provision of pitches generates additional infrastructure needs, develope rs of the larger 
housing proposal at TIV1, CU1, CU7 or CRE5 will be expected to contribute fairly towards the cost in accordance with 
Policies S8 and DM7 of this Plan.  
 
 
Policy S4  
 
Ensuring housing delivery  
 
The local planning authority will monitor the de livery of housing against the annual target set out in Policy S3 
and against the total completions which should have taken place since the start of the Local Plan period.  
Cumulative dwelling completions since 1st April 2013 will be compared with the follo wing defined action 
levels:   
Year  
(1st April - 31st March)  Action Levels  Cumulative Target  
2013/14  0 393 
2014/15  0 786 
2015/16  393 1179 
2016/17  786 1572 
2017/18  1179 1965 
2018/19  1572 2358 
2019/20  1965 2751 
2020/21  2358 3144 
2021/22  2751 3537 
2022/23 3144 3930 
2023/24  3537 4323 
2024/25  3930 4716 
2025/26  4323 5109 
2026/27  4716 5502 
2027/28  5109 5895 
2028/29  5502 6288 
2029/30  5895 6681 
2030/31  6288 7074 
2031/32  6681 7467 
2032/33  7074 7860 
 28 
 If cumulative completions since 2013 fall below t he expected completions total by over two years’ worth of 
the annual target (as expressed in the defined action level for that year), or a five year supply of deliverable 
sites cannot be demonstrated, the Council will work proactively to bring forward allo cations or outstanding 
planning consents.  If this is insufficient to deliver the necessary level of housing,  an identified contingency 
site will be permitted to boost housing supply.  
 
2.32 To ensure that Mid Devon can deliver the level of housing developm ent required to meet identified housing 
need there needs to be a mechanism that will allow further sites to come forward if for any reason the expected level 
of delivery falls significantly below the annual target set out under Policy S3. If housing delive ry falls below the action 
level this will be addressed through proactive development management to bring forward allocated and permitted 
sites, and then through the release of a deliverable contingency site.  However, there will be variation of delivery 
across the years so it is important that the action level when the designated contingency site will come forward will not 
trigger its release in response to normal variations in completions . The trigger level will therefore be when delivery has 
fallen two ye ars’ worth of expected annual completions behind the expected overall total for that year ( i.e. equivalent 
to 10% of overall plan housing need).  
 
2.33 The National Planning Policy Framework requires local planning authorities ensure that there is a supply  of 
specific deliverable housing sites with a capacity equivalent to 105% of five years’ worth of the annual housing target. 
The Local Plan proposals are designed to ensure that a five year supply of housing land is and remains available 
through the plan p eriod, from existing permissions and allocations.  However, should the Council at any time be 
unable to demonstrate a five year housing supply, it will prioritise actions to overcome constraints to the development 
of permitted or allocated sites.  If that is insufficient or will not deal with the issue quickly enough, the Council will 
permit the development of a contingency site in order to boost short term housing supply .   The Council will monitor 
the level of housing supply through its Authority’s Monito ring Report and instigate an early review of the Local Plan to 
identify further sites if necessary.  
 29 
 Policy S5  
 
Public open space  
 
Within the parish boundaries of Tiverton, Cullompton and Crediton and the parishes containing 
villages defined in Policy S1 3, the following standards for the provision of high quality open space will 
be applied:  
 
Type of open space  Quantity standard 
(square metres per 
dwelling)  Access standard  
Allotments  6 300 metres or 6 -7 minutes’ walk time  
Amenity green space  23.5 300 met res or 6 -7 minutes’ walk time  
Parks, sport and 
recreation grounds  35 include both 
public and private 
grounds (excluding 
education sites)  600 metres or 12 -13 minutes’  
walk time  
Play space (children)  1.5 300 metres or 6 -7 minutes’ walk time  
Youth space 
(teenagers)  0.5 600 metres or 12 -13 minutes’  
walk time  
 
In all other parishes, the following standards for the provision of open space will be applied:  
 
Type of open space  Quantity standard 
(square metres per 
dwelling ) Access standard  
Allotments  6 (for new  provision)  600 metres or 12 -13 
minutes’ walk time  
Recreation space  28 to include both 
public and private 
grounds (excluding 
education sites)  600 metres or 12 -13 
minutes’ walk time  
Play space  
(children and youth)  1 600 metres or 12 -13 
minutes’ walk time  
 
 
Developments of 11 or more dwellings within the parishes of Tiverton, Cullompton and Crediton, and 
6 or more dwellings elsewhere, will provide open space onsite or through offsite financial 
contributions, as follows:  
 
Type of provision  Up to 49 
dwelling s 50-199 
dwellings  200+ 
dwellings  
Play space  Offsite  Onsite  Onsite  
Amenity/natural green

Allotments  Offsite  Onsite  Onsite  30 
 Park, sport and recreation 
ground  Offsite  Offsite  Onsite  
Teenage facilities  Offsite  Offsite  Onsite  
 
2.34 Access to public open space including sports facilities is an essential element of healthy communities and 
national policy promotes such provision.  To this end the Council has undertaken an Open Space and Play Area Study 
(2014) to identify the level of supply across Mid Devon and the gaps in open space provision. This results in the above 
standards, which aim to maintain the current level of provision per person as Mid Devon’s population increases, and to 
increase the provision for teenage facilities which has been identified as a particular area of open space deficiency.  
Teenage facilities might include skateboard parks, basketball courts and ‘free access’ Multi Use Games Areas 
(MUGAs).  In practice, there will always be some flexibility of use where  younger children use equipment designed for 
youths and vice versa.   
  
2.35 The types of applicable public open space are set out in the policy.  For the purposes of this policy, other 
spaces such as grass verges, tree -lined avenues and sustainable urban drainage schemes are not classed as public 
open space.  The standards are applied to development proposals according to the average size of households in Mid 
Devo n (2.35 people).  
 
2.36 Onsite open space will be provided by the developer and designed in suc h a way as to maximise the 
attractiveness, safety and overall quality of the development.  The provision of larger multi -functional open space 
‘hubs’ is considered preferable to smaller fragmented open spaces across a development.  The balance of onsite an d 
offsite provision according to site size is set out in the policy, but the Council will consider on a case -by-case basis any 
proposals that seek to justify a different solution.  A planning obligation will be used to control the long -term 
maintenance of onsite open space through a management company.   
 
2.37 Smaller developments (fewer than 6 dwellings in rural areas or 11 dwellings in the towns) will not be required 
to provide a public open space contribution, in accordance with national guidance. Most h ousing developments 
increase the demand for open space in the area , but a financial contribution towards a public open space project 
outside the site (an offsite contribution) will be accepted according to the amount of development being proposed, as 
set o ut in the policy .  The Open Space and Play Area Strategy describes  which types of housing (such as open 
market, affordable or accommodation for the elderly) will be eligible for offsite provision of public open space.  The 
Council will identify locations a cross the district that require open space improvement or new provision, and for eligible 
developments will require a financial contribution through a planning obligation which secures funding for a specific 
project.  The amount required is related to the cost of providing and maintaining open space, expressed as a cost per 
person as set out in the Open Space and Play Area Strategy.  The Council will monitor the use of funds collected in 
this way to ensure that planning obligations are directly related to t he open space needs associated with each 
development.   
 
2.38 Viability testing undertaken by the Council has demonstrated that not all sites may be able to fund the full cost 
of the off -site contribution.  Therefore, the Council will consider a reduced co ntribution where it can be demonstrated 
that payment of the full cost would make the development unviable.  Further details on the policy’s application, 
including information on the consideration and submission of viability evidence will be set out in a re view of the 
existing Open Space Supplementary Planning Document, to be undertaken after the adoption of the Local Plan . 
 
2.39 The Council will not use the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to fund open space provision, to avoid illegal 
double -charging of  developers who are required to provide onsite open space as part of well -designed development 
while also paying CIL.  However, at least 15% of CIL receipts will be transferred to the parish council in the area a 
development takes place, and parish council s may spend this money on any infrastructure in their area which may 
include the creation, development, repair or maintenance of existing areas of open space.  
 
2.40 Policy DM24 protects existing public open spaces from development, including some identifi ed areas of ‘Local 
Green Space’.  Communities may also seek to protect such areas through designation in a neighbourhood plan or by 
registering sites as Assets of Community Value (as defined in the glossary).  31 
 Employment 
 
Policy S6  
 
Employment  
 
The employ ment needs of the community will be met through the development of 147,000 square 
metres of commercial floorspace comprising a range of employment -generating uses, including:  
 
a) Offices, industry, storage and distribution (B1 -B8); 
b) Retail, tourism and l eisure (A1 -A5, C1, D2 and relevant sui generis uses);  
c) Development for healthcare, education and pub lic facilities (C2 -C2a, D1); and 
d) Other forms of sustainable employment -generating uses.  
 
2.41 The Council’s employment strategy is inclusive, seeking t o provide the jobs the market can deliver by 
promoting a range of employment -generating uses.  While the majority of commercial land allocations comprise B1, 
B2 and B8 uses, the plan has a positive approach to other uses that provide jobs in a sustainable manner.  
 
2.42 Employment floorspace is measured according to ‘gross internal floorspace’, meaning the area of floor inside 
the walls.  This applies to use classes B1 (business), B2 (general industry) and B8 (storage and distribution) and will 
generally be applied to all commercial development, except for retail within use class A1 (shops).  A1 retail floorspace 
is ‘net floorspace’, meaning the area of a store used for sales.  Within this class, ‘convenience’ means food sales, 
while ‘comparison’ means anythi ng else.    
 
2.43 The Employment Land Review (2013) presents forecasts for employment land in Mid Devon, taking account 
of economic projections and past take -up of employment land.  The Employment Land Review recommends that the 
Council plan for 30 -40 hect ares of employment land over a twenty year period, equating to approximately 140,000 
square metres floorspace.   
 
2.44 Very large employment sites can be more difficult to deliver due to high infrastructure costs, and there is an 
identified shortage of sma ll-scale employment sites.  Development Management policies allow for small -scale 
employment and other commercial development in suitable locations.  These sites can come forward according to 
market demand and a land allocation will not always be necessary .  However, the towns are usually the most 
sustainable locations for planned employment growth, where there is an existing local population and access to 
services.  Commercial development is expected to be delivered through a combination of site allocation s and windfall 
developments elsewhere.  
  
2.45 The Local Plan’s employment strategy seeks to guide a deliverable level of development to the most 
sustainable locations while recognising that larger employment centres such as Exeter and Taunton will continue  to 
draw some of Mid Devon’s working population, and suitable employment in rural areas will benefit the rural economy.  
 
2.46 The Retail Study (2012) identifies a quantitative need of approximately 7,000  square metres of comparison 
retail floorspace up to 2026.  Long -term forecasting of retail demand is not very reliable, so the anticipated need has 
been applied across the plan period to 2033 on the understanding that allocated and non -allocated sites will come 
forward according to market demand and the pla n will be reviewed before the need to 2026 is likely to have been 
exhausted.  Retail development will generally be directed towards town centres and the Council will apply a sequential 
approach in assessing edge -of-centre or out -of-centre proposals, in acc ordance with Policies S7, DM14 and DM15.  In 
addition, development as proposed at Junction 27 of the M5 meets a tourism / leisure need in a location which is 
suitable for its regional role with a controlled retail element supporting the tourism and leisure  aspects of the proposal.

 Town centres  
 
Policy S7  
 
Town centres  
 
The vitality and viability of the town centres of Tiverton, Cullompton and Crediton will be protected 
and enhanced by positive mana gement so that economic regeneration and heritage conservation 
reinforce each other as follows:  
 
a) Positive measures of enhancement and regeneration;  
b) Promoting new homes, shops, leisure, offices and other key town centre uses which are well 
designed an d contribute to vitality and viability;  
c) Outside the town centres of Tiverton, C ullompton and Crediton, only permit new retail, leisure, 
office and other ke y town centre uses where they meet the sequential and impact tests set out in 
Policy DM15; and  
d) Traffic management measures including improving sustainable travel opportunities and 
interchange facilities to improve town centre environment and accessibility.  
 
2.48 Policy S7 seeks to secure the sustainability of Mid Devon’s market towns, focusing deve lopment within town 
centres.  The Council will work in partnership to deliver the objectives of Policy S7 and will integrate other local plans 
and strategies, including neighbourhood plans where these are being prepared.  Investment will be directed to 
enhance and regenerate areas of environmental, social and economic deprivation.  Networks and interchange 
facilities, which provide opportunities for better integration of public transport and sustainable ways of travelling, will b e 
improved. Town centre heal th checks will be undertaken to monitor the condition of each of the market towns in 
respect of the objectives set out above.  This focus on healthy town centres does not preclude retail, leisure and 
recreation uses within strategic site allocations, such as East Cullompton. Sustainable development of such large sites 
requires a mix of uses, providing residents with close access to employment, recreation and small -scale convenience 
shopping, though these mixed uses  must be carefully planned so as not to und ermine town centres.  A masterplan will 
set out the principles to be followed in subsequent planning applications. A sequential test applied at planning 
application stage will be considered in this context. The allocation of land at Junction 27 to provide a  high quality 
tourist and leisure focused development to meet needs identified within the tourism study will include associated 
outlet/discounted retail floorspace to meet a regional comparison floorspace need and deliver the tourist and leisure 
elements o f the allocation. Existing town centres will be safeguarded through planning controls.  
 
2.49 Mid Devon’s town centres face a challenging future due to changing national retailer requirements, online 
shopping and reduced consumer spending.  The Retail Study  suggests that a changing role or focus for town centres 
may be required, involving conversion and redevelopment to other uses.  To this end, the Local Plan incorporates 
tourism and leisure uses within the retail part of the commercial development target i n Policy S2 and has a positive 
strategy for the enhancement and regeneration of town centres.  Town centre redevelopment is expected to include 
some residential accommodation, to improve the viability of development and the vitality of the town centre.   
 
2.50 Research by English Heritage, the Heritage Lottery Fund and others clearly demonstrate the significant 
contribution of heritage to the economy.  Policy S7 emphasises the importance of heritage conservation in making the 
town centres attractive places to visit.

 Infrastructure 
 
Policy S8 
 
Infrastructure  
 
The location, scale and form of development will be guided by the need for community facilities and 
any existing infrastructure deficiencies.  The  Council will work with providers and developers to 
ensure that new development is served by necessary infrastructure in a predictable, timely and 
effective fashion.  Development and transport planning will be coordinated to improve accessibility 
for the w hole community and promote the use of sustainable modes of transport.  The Council will set 
out key infrastructure and facility requirements for new development in an Infrastructure Plan, taking 
account of existing provision and cumulative impact of new de velopment.  Developers will be 
expected to contribute fairly towards, or bear the full cost of, new or improved infrastructure and 
facilities where it is appropriate for them to do so, subject to viability assessment where appropriate.  
Planning permission will be granted only where the impact of development is not considered to be 
severe. Where severe impacts that are attributable to the development are considered likely, including 
as a consequence of cumulative impacts, they must be subject to satisfactory  mitigation having 
regard to the latest infrastructure plan.  
 
2.52 Ensuring that new development is served by appropriate infrastructure is an important role of the planning 
system.  This is achieved by the provision of infrastructure in step with developm ent and by guiding development to 
places where there is existing capacity.  There is also the possibility that new development can be guided to locations 
where its infrastructure will help to achieve wider planning objectives such as air quality improvemen ts.  Developments 
likely to generate significant levels of traffic must be supported by a robust transport evidence base.  
 
2.53 This policy underpins site allocation policies such as the North West Cullompton and East Cullompton urban 
extensions, which wi ll provide traffic solutions to improve motorway junction capacity and reduce traffic through the 
town centre.  Facilities such as schools, green infrastructure and community halls will be provided or enhanced as 
appropriate, to account for the increased d emand arising from new development.  The strategic sites will also include 
care homes or other provision for older people in recognition of the aging population and its associated needs.  The 
Council will guide development to locations where there is suffi cient sewerage capacity, or require that increased 
capacity be provided in step with development which will help to deliver Water Framework Directive objectives. The 
need for investment will be reviewed and addressed by South West Water through 5 yearly cy cle plans. Sewerage 
network improvements will be negotiated in line with the provisions of the Water Act in conjunction with developers as 
and when the need arises.  
 
2.54 For most sites funds for infrastructure delivery will be secured through the Communit y Infrastructure Levy 
(CIL); a charge per square metre of eligible new development.  The rate of payment for CIL has been subject to 
viability assessment which takes account of the other policy requirements affecting viability, such as affordable 
housing t argets.  Legal agreements under Section 106 of The Town and Country Planning Act (1990) may be used 
instead of CIL if the proceeds would exceed the amount of CIL that would be generated from the development.  
Section 106 Agreements, a type of planning obli gation, will also be used to secure funding for specific public open 
space projects in the district, as discussed under Policy S5.  The strategic sites (Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension, 
North West Cullompton , East Cullompton and Junction 27 ) will be zero -rated for CIL and these developments will be 
required to pay for necessary infrastructure through Section 106 agreements, undergoing viability assessment at 
planning application stage if necessary.   
 
2.55 There is currently a significant infrastructure fu nding gap and the Council will also seek external sources of 
funding to deliver key infrastructure.  More information about the means of funding infrastructure can be found in the 
most recent Infrastructure Plan and the ‘Regulation 123’ list for CIL, avail able on the Council’s website .  CIL is also 36 
 accompanied by a policy setting out the circumstances in which Section 106 agreements are to be used.  It is 
anticipated that CIL will be adopted at th e same time as the Local Plan.  
  37 
 Environment 
 
Policy S9 
 
Environment  
 
Development will sustain the distinctive quality, character and diversity of Mid Devon’s environmental 
assets and minimise the impact of development on climate change through:  
 
a) High quality sustainable design which reinforces the character and  distinctiveness of Mid Devon’s 
historic built environment, mitigates and adapts to climate change and creates attractive places;  
b) The efficient use and conservation of natural resources of land, water and energy, minimising 
pollutio n and preserving the quality and productivity of the best and most versatile agricultural 
land wherever possible;  
c) The provision of measures to reduce the risk of flooding to life and property, requiring 
sustainable drainage systems including provisions for future maintenanc e, guiding develo pment 
to locations of lowest flood risk by applying a sequential test where appropriate, and avoiding an 
increase in flood risk elsewhere;  
d) Renewable energy development in locations where there is an acceptable local impact, including 
visual, on  nearby residents, landscape character and wildlife, balanced with the wide r 
sustainability benefits of renewable energy;  
e) The preservation and enhancement of the distinctive qualities of Mid Devon’s natural landscape, 
supporting opp ortunities id entified within landscape character areas.  Within the Black down Hills 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and within the setting of the Blackdown Hills Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty, and Exmoor and Dartmoor National Parks, the primary objective will 
be to protect the special qualities of that landscape and its setting;   
f) The protection and enhancement of designated sites of international,  national and local 
biodiversity and geodiversity importance.  On both designated and undesignated sites, 
develop ment will support  opportunities for protecting and enhancing species populations and 
linking habitats . If significant harm resulting from development cannot be avoided impacts should 
be adequately mitigated.   Compensation measures  will only be considered  where appropriate  as a 
last resort ; and  
g) The preservation and enhancement of Mid Devon’s cultural and historic environment, and the 
protection of sites, buildings, areas and features of recognised national and local importance 
such as listed buildings, c onservation areas, scheduled monuments and local heritage assets.   
 
2.56 The environmental qualities of the district are highly valued by the community and the preservation and 
enhancement of Mid Devon’s distinctive environmental assets are important to t he achievement of sustainable 
development.  Changes in land use, agricultural practices and new development are all threats to the quality of Mid 
Devon’s environment unless properly managed, while the effects of climate change will provide both challenges and 
opportunities.  New development will be located, designed and constructed in ways that reinforce local distinctiveness, 
respond to climate change and provide positive solutions for protecting and enhancing environmental assets.  
Mitigation measures wil l be sought where appropriate, to achieve neutral or positive effects on the environment, 
including ecological measures which would help to deliver Water Framework Directive objectives.    
 
2.57 The Government’s approach in tackling climate change has evol ved over time.  Ambitious carbon reduction 
targets have led to Government incentives for renewable energy schemes, resulting in a marked increase in planning 
applications for wind turbines and field -scale solar energy development.  The Mid Devon Landscape Sensitivity 
Assessment considers the susceptibility of different parts of the landscape to change as a result of wind and solar 
energy development of different sizes, scales and groupings.  This assessment is a material consideration in decision -
making, al ongside evidence of biodiversity, noise, glare and other impacts.   38 
  
2.58 Development Management policies on design, green infrastructure, protected landscapes/habitats and 
heritage assets provide detailed criteria for development.  
 39 
 Tiverton 
 
Policy S10 
 
Tiverton  
 
Tiverton will continue to develop in a balanced way as a medium sized market town serving a rural 
hinterland in the central part of Mid Devon and to the north.  The strategy will maintain its status as 
the largest urban area in Mid Devon and inc rease the self -sufficiency of the town and its area by 
improving access to housing, employment and services for its population and that of the surrounding 
rural areas.  Proposals will provide for approximately 2,358 dwellings, of which 660 will be affordab le, 
and 29,400 gross square metres of commercial floor space over the plan period.  
 
The Council will guide high quality development and other investment to:  
 
a) Manage the town centre so that economic success and heritage reinforce each other, promoting 
new homes, shops, leisure, offices and key town centre uses which contribute to vitality and 
viability, including an additional 7,000 square metres of gross commercial floorspace in 
accordance with the sequential approach in Policy DM15;  
b) Enhance walking a nd cycling opportunities and bus services around the town, particularly 
improving access via these more sustainable modes to the town centre, Tiverton Parkway Station, 
Exeter and Taunton , and their interchange in the town centre;  
c) Retain the green settin g provided by the steep open hillsides, particularly to the west and south of 
the town and the historic parkland of Knightshayes to the north of the A361;  
d) Protect the importance of Tidcombe Fen, other areas of biodiversity value and green 
infrastructur e, supporting opportunities for enhancement;  
e) Enhance the tourism and visitor role of the town and surrounding area; and  
f) Support measures to reduce flood risk within Tiverton , working with natural processes wherever 
possible.  
 
2.59 Tiverton is the la rgest settlement in Mid Devon, with the largest economic concentration and level of social 
and commercial services.  It is the focus of a reasonable level of public transport provision.  However, the long -term 
options for Tiverton’s growth are constrained by the town’s topography, flood plains and the position of the A361.  
Cumulative traffic impacts on Junction 27 of the M5 must also be considered. While the evidence suggests that 
improvements to signalisation of the junction have provided capacity for pla nned strategic development in Tiverton, 
additional development may require improvements to the junction. Traffic assessments will be required where 
appropriate to consider impacts on the local and strategic road network.  
 
2.60 As the largest town in the di strict, there is an expectation that Tiverton will deliver approximately 2,358  
dwellings over the plan period.  Recent completions and current commitments total over 1,750  dwellings.  It is 
therefore expected that a significant proportion of the town’s outs tanding housing needs will be delivered as part of the 
Eastern Urban Extension allocation (TIV1 -5), with the remainder provided by smaller allocations.  Sites have been 
allocated in excess of the anticipated development levels to allow for flexibility in t he supply of housing and 
employment, as discussed in paragraphs 2.1 -2.16.  A contingency site ha s been allocated within the town, forming 
part of the strategy for providing flexibility within the plan.  
 
2.61 Retail forecasts identify a need for additional non-food retail floorspace in Tiverton.  The Retail Study (2012) 
recommends that site allocations for retail development include the redevelopment and improvement of the bus 
station and existing open -air car parks.  The area around Phoenix Lane in Tiverton  is available, suitable and 
achievable for a mixed use redevelopment scheme.   
 40 
 2.62 Historically, the take -up of employment allocations in Tiverton has been slow, while the larger urban centres of 
Exeter and Taunton are established employment destinations  and will continue to draw a large number of Mid Devon’s 
working residents.  The Employment Land Review (2013) advises on the locations and amounts of development 
appropriate in the towns.   In accordance with this, the Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension is expected to provide 
30,000 square metres of employment floorspace, phased to come forward in step with housing development.  
Employment development in this location, close to the A361, may serve to claw back some of the jobs that are 
currently being lost t o other settlements outside Mid Devon.

 Cullompton 
 
Policy S11  
 
Cullompton  
 
Cullompton will develop as a fast growing market town with a strategic role in the hierarchy of 
settlements in Mid Devon. The town will become the strategic focus of new development reflecting its 
accessibility,  economic potential and environmental capacity.  This strategy will improve access to 
housing through urban extensions and expanded employment opportunities. There will be significant 
improvements to the town’s infrastructure and connectivity, including th e reopening of the railway 
station, and improved services for its population and nearby rural areas. Proposals will provide for 
approximately 3,930 dwellings, of which 1,100 will be affordable, and 73,500 gross square metres of 
commercial floor space over the plan period.  
 
The Council will guide high quality development and other investment to:  
 
a) Make any necessary strategic mitigations to maintain highway capacity , safety , integrity, and 
sustainability including the M5 and local highway network in conjun ction with current and 
relevant infrastructure plans ;  
b) Promote further public transport improvements within Cullompton  and to other urban centres 
(particularly Tiverton and Exeter) and improved access to the rail network by the reopening of 
Cullompton R ailway Station;  
c) Continue measures to support the implementation of the Cullompton Air Quality Action Plan 
including the construction of new highway links to relie ve the town centre and enhanced walking 
and cycling opportunities around the town;  
d) Manag e the town centre so that economic regeneration and heritage reinforce each other by 
promoting new homes, shops,  leisure, offices and other key town centre uses which are well 
designed and contribute to vitality and viability;  
e) Provide community infrast ructure such as education and enhanced open space to support new 
development proposals;  
f) Enhance the tourism and visitor role of the town and surrounding area; and  
g) Support measures to reduce flood risk within Cullompton and make provision for green 
infrastructure .  
 
2.64 Cullompton is situated 11 miles north of Exeter and about 20 miles south west of Taunton. The M5 motorway 
runs close to the east side of the town. The B3181 runs through the centre of the town and links Exeter and Willand. 
The town lie s in the Culm Valley with the river passing the east side of the town.  Cullompton’s location on the 
strategic road network, its close proximity to Exeter and the availability of land for development make it a suitable 
destination for long -term growth.  A Critical Drainage Area (CDA) has been identified by the Environment Agency at 
Cullompton. The aim of this CDA is to ensure there is no increase in flood risk downstream as a result of development 
pressure. A Flood Risk Assessment will be required at the pl anning application stage for development proposed in the 
CDA to determine specific recommendations for mitigation. All new development will require additional water storage 
areas to be created within the site compared to the normal SUDs design thereby cont ributing to a reduction in flooding 
downstream. The Environment Agency (EA) is a  statutory consultee on all developments in Critical Drainage Areas 
and flood zones 2 and 3,  while the Lead Local Flood Authority (Devon County Council) w ill be a statutory con sultee on 
all major development.  
 
2.65 The largest single site allocation in the Local Plan is East Cullompton (Policies CU7 -CU12), which will have 
access onto the M5 motorway and deliver significant improvements to highways infrastructure for the whole to wn.  
There has also been a long -standing public desire to see the reopening of Cullompton  Railway Station.  The proposal 42 
 is gaining momentum and is included within Network Rail’s Western Route Study (draft for consultation) 2014 which 
sets out the strategi c vision for the western part of the rail network over the next 30 years.  The Council supports the 
reopening of the station and the Local Plan allocates a possible site for this.  The combination of highways 
improvements and a new railway station provides  an opportunity to significantly raise the profile of Cullompton and the 
wider area, attracting inward investment.   
 
2.66 Pedestrian and cycle links to the town centre will be improved, and residents will be in close proximity to job 
opportunities within Cullompton and also at Willand, Tiverton and Exeter.  The concurrent development of the North 
West Cullompton Urban Extension will see a new road linking Tiverton Road to Willand Road, which will relieve traffic 
congestion in the town centre, improving loc al air quality and the living conditions of residents. The town centre acts 
as a strategic relief route for the M5 during closures resulting in significant congestion.  A new relief road, to the east of 
the town centre, will further improve local air qualit y by diverting north - and south -bound traffic away from Fore Street.  
Note that the name of the road, originally called the Eastern Relief Road when allocated in the Allocations and 
Infrastructure DPD, has been amended to Town Centre Relief Road to more ac curately reflect its role.  Significant 
growth in Cullompton can be made sustainable through this investment in infrastructure, addressing long -standing 
issues of air quality and motorway junction capacity.   
 
2.67 The major growth of the town will provide  the opportunity to revitalise the town centre through additional 
investment, traffic and transport improvements.   The growth of the town and proposed improvements will provide a 
significant boost to its vitality and viability, providing a more attractive  retail environment through organic change in the 
town centre by which the use of existing underused and struggling premises is improved, rather than through the 
delivery of new retail floorspace.  The need for additional retail floorspace will be reviewed  as part of the process of 
preparing the next Local Plan.  
 
2.68 Future employment provision is expected to be centred around the Kingsmill industrial estate and within the 
adjoining urban extension at East Cullompton.  Access to the motorway will need to b e improved before significant 
levels of development come forward.  Masterplanning of the East Cullompton urban extension will include a phasing 
strategy which ensures that infrastructure is provided in step with development.

 Crediton  
 
Policy S12  
 
Crediton  
 
Crediton will  continue to develop in its role as a small and vibrant market town, serving a rural 
hinterland in the western part of the district.  The strategy aims to improve access to housing within 
the town, expand employment opportunities and improve the quantity a nd quality of the existing retail 
provision.  Proposals will provide for approximately 786 dwellings, of which 220 will be affordable, 
and 14,700 gross square metres of commercial floorspace over the plan period.  
 
The following development will be supporte d over the plan period:  
 
a) Proposals which support the economic regeneration of the town centre, including the provision of 
new homes, commercial development, cultural facilities and other key town centre uses which 
support the town centre’s viability and  vitality.  Particular support will be given for proposals 
which improve the quantity and quality of existing retail provision within the town centre.  All 
proposals within the town centre will need to  play a positive role in sustaining and enh ancing the 
significance of the area’s heritage;  
b) Proposals which respect the setting provided by the open areas of hillside and the adjoining 
historic parklands of Creedy Park, Shobrooke Park and Downes;  
c) Continuation of measures to support the implementation of the Crediton Air Quality Action Plan, 
including enhanced walking and cycling  opportunities around the town;  
d) Enhance the tourism facilities and visitor role of the town and surrounding area ; and  
e) Community and education facilities and othe r infrastruct ure to support the development 
proposed , including green infrastructure . 
 
2.70 Crediton is a small and vibrant market town, located in the west of the district.   The town is situated near to 
the Rivers Creedy and Yeo, and is set within a landscape of farm land extending across gently rolling hills and broad 
valleys.  It lies within what is known as the ‘Crediton Trough’, a low lying flattish basin feature.  The town’s past is 
reflected in the historic core, principally focused around the High Street.  The t own is a focal point for the surrounding 
area, providing a level of employment and services.  Opportunities for the expansion of Crediton are limited, given the 
steep topography around the town, adjoining historic parklands and traffic congestion through t he town centre.  
 
2.71 In 2006 Crediton was designated as an Air Quality Management Area as a result of unacceptably high levels 
of airborne pollutants in the centre of the settlement.  However, one of the key actions set out within the Air Quality 
Action Plan, the Crediton Link Road, has been provided.  This is likely to have a significant impact on local air quality, 
directing a proportion of HGV and other traffic to Lords Meadow Industrial Estate, away from the town centre.  Air 
quality monitoring will d etermine whether the pollutants have reduced sufficiently for the Air Quality Action Plan to be 
withdrawn.  
 
2.72 The Employment Land Review (2013) points to a limited demand for employment growth in Crediton.  The 
Retail Study (2012) identifies no requirem ent for additional retail floorspace within the town, but development 
management and town centre initiatives should seek to improve and upgrade the quality of the existing provision.  
 
2.73 The total housing target for Crediton ( 786 dwellings) represents 1 0% of the  district’s total requirement. This is 
lower than might be expected for a town of this size, but environmental constraints limit Crediton’s expansion and the 
development can be more sustainably located elsewhere.  The sites allocated in the Local Plan have been subject to 
Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) and are considered available, suitable and achievable.

 Rural areas  
 
Policy S13  
 
Villages 
 
The following rural settlements will be designated as villages suitable for limited development: 
Bampton, Bow, Bradninch, Chawleigh, Cheriton Bishop, C heriton Fitzpaine, Copplestone, Culmstock, 
Halberton, Hemyock, Holcombe Rogus, Kentisbeare, Lapford, Morchard Bishop, Newton St Cyres, 
Sampford Peverell, Sandford, Silverton, Thorverton, Uffculme, Willand and Yeoford.  
Development will be limited to proposa ls within their defined settlement limits and to allocations for:  
 
a) Small scale housing, employment, tourism and leisure;  
b) Services and facilities serving the locality; and  
c) Other limited development which enhances community vitality or meets a loca l social or 
economic need.  
 
2.75 There are a number of settlements which do not function as market towns, but which provide a limited level of 
services which support vibrant rural communities. These are locations which are suitable for a limited level of 
development meeting local needs appropriate to their individual opportunities.  Sites for affordable housing may also 
come forward in locations that are not designated villages in Policy S13 above, subject to local need as demonstrated 
through a local hous ing needs survey or other suitable evidence.  Policy DM6 (rural exceptions sites) explains the 
Council’s approach to considering ‘exception sites’ for affordable housing.  
 
2.76 The 22 settlements set out in the policy are considered to be appropriate for a limited level of development, 
based on their physical characteristics, and the availability of the following three essential services identified:  
 
 • Educational facility  
 • Convenience store  
 • Transport service  
 
2.77 Yeoford does not have a shop but i s considered appropriate for inclusion in Policy S13 due to its accessibility 
to other settlements and the availability of public transport including an hourly train service.  The settlement limits of 
the villages defined in Policy S13 are shown on the Pol icies Map and site allocations are set out in the relevant section 
of the Local Plan.  
 
2.78 Rural areas are expected to accommodate approximately 10% of the housing requirement for Mid Devon up 
to 2033.  483 dwellings have been allocated and are considered  available, suitable and achievable, capable of coming 
forward within the first 10 years of the plan.  It is also likely that a small number of windfall developments will be built 
within settlement limits or through the rural exceptions policy (Policy DM6).   Given that more than half of Mid Devon’s 
population currently resides outside the main towns, this is considered a sustainable approach which will maintain the 
vitality and viability of rural settlements.  
 
2.79 Proposals for more than 5 dwellings in vill ages will be required to provide 30% affordable housing, which will 
be in the form of off -site contributions for sites of 6 -10 dwellings.  Exception sites may also come forward outside 
settlement limits, but these will need to demonstrate a need for afford able housing, and any element of market 
housing must be limited to the lowest amount possible to facilitate the provision of affordable housing.   In appropriate 
circumstances, self -build housing will be permitted through the exceptions policy (Policy DM6) .  Other development 
management policies will also be applied, along with the Council’s Supplementary Planning Document on Meeting 
Housing Needs.   
 47 
 2.80 Historically, employment sites in rural areas across Mid Devon have been delivered primarily through w indfall 
sites with limited provision on allocated land. The 2012 -2013 Mid Devon Employment Land Survey noted that since 
2006 only two small parts of allocated land at Willand and approximately 50% of allocated land at Bampton had been 
completed. The Counci l recognises the importance of retaining and providing rural employment opportunities, but the 
combination of permitted development rights and supportive general policies is considered sufficient to deliver 
employment according to demand in rural areas.  However, recent permissions indicate there is  demand for 
employment in Willand so the  Willand Industrial Estate is retained along with Scott’s Quarry at Bampton because the 
development has planning permission and is deliverable.  In general, site allocation s within the towns meet the overall 
target for commercial development across the district, providing flexibility and choice in the market.

Development outside the settlements defined by Policies S10 -S13 will preser ve and where possible 
enhance the character, appearance and biodiversity of the countryside while promoting sustainable 
diversification of the rural economy.  Detailed development management policies will permit 
agricultural and other appropriate rural use s, subject to the following criteria:  
 
a) Affordable and low cost housing to meet local needs, gypsy and traveller accommodation,  
residential conversion of ap propriate existing buildings, replacement dwellings, housing essential 
to accommodate a rural work er and accommodation ancillary to a dwelling;   
b) Appropriately scaled retail, employment, f arm diversification, tourism and leisure related 
development (includi ng appropriate conversion of existing buildings);  
c) Appropriately scaled and designed extensio ns and other p hysical alterations to existing 
buildings;  
d) Agricultural and equestrian development;  
e) Community facilities, such as educational facilities, buildings associated with public open space, 
transportation and infrastructure proposals  (includin g green infrastructure); and  
f) Renewable energy and telecommunications.  
 
 
2.81 National policy supports thriving rural communities and encourages multiple benefits from the use of land in 
rural areas. Development in the countryside in the context of this policy is defined by land outside of the settlement 
limits of the main towns (S10 -S12) and villages (S13).  A strong rural economy is promoted by national policy through 
sustainable growth of business and enterprise in rural areas. Development in the count ryside will be managed to meet 
local need, promote vibrant rural communities and help provide appropriate forms of agricultural and rural 
diversification to support the rural economy and sustain environmental qualities of the countryside. Development 
manag ement policies allow for small -scale employment development in suitable locations whilst retaining the intrinsic 
character and beauty of the countryside.  These sites can come forward according to market demand.  
 
2.82 To promote sustainable development in  rural areas, housing has been allocated where it will enhance or 
maintain the vitality of rural communities.  New isolated homes will be avoided in the countryside unless there are 
special circumstances as set out in national policy and supplemented in re levant Local Plan policies such as Policy 
DM6 (rural exception sites), DM8 (rural workers dwellings) and DM9 (conversion of rural buildings).  In the context of 
the Mid Devon Local Plan, ‘isolated’ refers to any location outside of defined settlement limit s.  Such land is defined as 
the countryside which can include small settlements and hamlets.  National policy requires that new sites for travellers 
should be limited in open countryside that is away from existing settlements or outside areas allocated in the 
development plan. In certain circumstances the development of such sites outside of settlement limits will be 
appropriate, providing it can meet the criteria set out within Policy DM7 (gypsy and traveller accommodation).  
 
2.83 National policy advocates  the provision of market housing in rural areas where it would facilitate the provision 
of significant affordable housing required to meet housing need. To facilitate the provision of affordable and low cost 
(discounted) housing in rural areas across Mid D evon, rural exception sites will be considered in line with Policy DM6 
and the Council’s Supplementary Planning Document on Meeting Housing Needs.

 Site Allocations 
 
3.1 The overall amount of development is discussed earlier in t his plan, with Policy S2 setting out targets for 
development across the district.  After existing commitments (sites under construction or with planning permission) 
have been deducted, there is a net requirement for dwellings and commercial floorspace to 2 033. 
 
3.2 Site allocations have been subject to Strategic Housing and Commercial Land Availability Assessments.  This 
is a technical assessment of the broad suitability, availability and achievability of potential development sites.  It does 
not indicate w hether or not sites should be allocated; the selection of sites to be allocated has taken place through the 
preparation of the Local Plan, taking account of other information and consultation.  The net requirement for 
development is shown in the table belo w, based on the targets contained in Policy S2.

3.4 Nine sites are allocated for housing in Tiverton, excluding one contingency site  at Tidcombe Hall that will be 
permitted to come forward if the Council’s  housing supply proves insufficient, as set out in Policy S4.  All housing sites 
are considered achievable in principle, corresponding to a Tiverton map that accompanies this document.  Net site 
areas shown in Table 12 reflect the land area considered deve lopable after land has been provided for access, 
strategic landscaping and other uses.  For very small sites, the whole site area is often considered developable.  The 
majority of Tiverton’s housing is to be provided through the strategic site Eastern Urba n Extension (TIV1 -5).  Although 
the housing growth of the town is therefore dependent on this site coming forward, there is limited risk associated with 
this because there is a good track record of joint working between the Council and the site promoters, with half of the 
site covered by an adopted masterplan, and approximately  1,000 dwellings now with planning  permission .

3.5 A number of  housing sites were allocated in the previous Local Plan and already have planning approval, but 
are either not yet under construction or only recently implemented .  These sites are retained as Local Plan allocations 
to ensure that policy criteria still ap ply in the event that revised schemes are submitted or planning permission lapses.

3.6 Two sites in Tiverton are allocated to deliver employment up to 2033, through a range of uses.   The amount 
of floorspace to be provided by commercial development depends on the use.  For instanc e, office development on 
multiple floors provides a greater amount of floorspace per hectare than a single -storey warehouse, and some 
commercial uses require more land for parking than others.  Floorspace assumptions for different uses are set out in 
the m ethodology for Strategic Commercial Land Availability Assessment (SCLAA), but the Council recognises that this 
is only a starting point and a higher or lower density of development may be justified depending on the nature of the 
proposal that comes forward .

Eastern Urban Ex tension  
 
 
A site of 153 hectares east of Tiverton is allocated for mixed use development as follows:  
 
a) 1580 to 1830  dwellings ; 
b) A proportion of affordable dwellings subj ect to further assessment of viability to include at least 
five pitches for gypsies  and travellers;  
c) At least 30,000 square metres commercial floorspace;  
d) 47 hectares strategic green infrastructure;  
e) Highway mitigation measures and transport provision to ensure appropriate accessibility for all 
modes;  
f) Environmental protection an d enhancement;  
g) Community facilities to meet local needs arising, including a new primary  school and 
neighbourhood centre;  
h) An agreed strategy to bring forward development and infrastructure in  step and retain the overall 
viability of development; and  
i) Compliance with the adopted masterplan and completion of a public Masterplanning exercise in 
respect of the southeast of the site (Area B in the adopted masterplan).  
 
3.8 The allocation is carried forward from the Allocation and Infrastructure DPD whic h identifies it for from 1550 to 
2000 dwellings. The masterplan for the Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension was adopted in April 2014.  It includes 
provision for 15 22 dwellings, 30,000 square metres mixed commercial floorspace and a target of 35% affordable 
housing (subject to viability as each phase comes forward).  Taking into account permissions granted or with a 
resolution to grant permission subject to a S106 agreement, it is considered that the site would be suitable to provide 
for 1580 dwellings. More d etailed masterplanning of Area B is yet to take place and will establish the final number of 
dwellings and may demonstrate that a higher number of dwellings are able to be accommodated. Accordingly a range 
of housing numbers is given for the allocation. Th is approach to housing numbers reflects that taken by the Inspector 
on the Allocations and Infrastructure DPD.  At least five gypsy and traveller pitches will be provided, some of which will 
be in the first phase of development, helping to meet the needs id entified in the Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation 
Assessment (2015).  The masterplan includes a phasing strategy which ensures that a new junction onto the A361 be 
provided early in the development, along with traffic calming and environmental enhancement on Blundell’s Road.  
The development will also provide a new primary school, a neighbourhood centre for shopping and community use, 
and various forms of open space to meet the needs of residents.  
 
3.9 The site was originally intended to accommodate up to 2,000 houses and this would have necessitated a new 
access road to link the development to Heathcoat Way, thereby allowing Blundell’s Road to be closed to general traffic 
and used mainly for access by sustainable travel modes.  The allocated site is no lon ger expected to deliver this 
amount of housing and the access road cannot be justified for the amount of development proposed.  However, any 
proposal for significant further development to the east of the allocated urban extension would be likely to trigge r the 
requirement for this additional road, subject to detailed design and the advice of the Highway Authority (Devon County 
Council).  
 
3.10 The Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension meets most of Tiverton’s development needs and is expected to take 
10-15 year s to be completed.  As the largest of Mid Devon’s towns, Tiverton is a sustainable location for development 
to meet the housing and employment needs of a growing population.  Environmental constraints such as topography, 
flood plains and the position of th e A361 limit the opportunities for expansion, making the Post Hill area the only 
suitable site for a development of this size.  This necessitates the loss of some Grade 2 agricultural land.  However, 
longer terms strategic housing needs for Mid Devon will be met through housing allocations at Cullompton which is 
less constrained.  54 
  
3.11 The provision of affordable housing is an important local priority and the adopted masterplan includes a target 
of 35% affordable housing.  However, developments must contin ue to be viable and affordable housing targets can 
make a considerable difference to viability. In the case of the Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension, there are 
considerable infrastructure costs and these bear heavily on the viability of this strategically i mportant development. 
The Council therefore proposes that the proportion and timescale for provision of affordable housing be subject to 
further assessment of viability. It is expected that sites will contain a mix of housing types, including where appropr iate 
provision for the elderly. The affordable housing requirement will need to be reassessed as applications come forward 
to ensure that affordable housing need continues to be met whilst ensuring the development remains viable.  External 
funding sources,  such as the Local Transport Fund are being used to contribute towards the cost of the road junction 
on to the A361.  Furthermore, to reflect the high cost of infrastructure the site will be zero -rated for Community 
Infrastructure Levy.  Instead, infrastru cture will be funded through Section 106 agreements, of which delivery of the 
site will be limited to no more than five per infrastructure type or project.  
 
3.12 The policies for this allocation are based on the evidence available to the Council when prepa ring them. It is 
important that the policies are not seen as rigid and unalterable in the light of new evidence. Therefore, where new 
information or evidence arises which indicates an alternative approach to a particular subject and this retains the 
overal l strategic thrust of the proposals, then the Council will consider such proposals.  Nevertheless, the policies and 
requirements of this plan should not be overturned lightly or without clear justification.  
 
 
Policy TIV2 
 
Eastern Urban Extension Transport Provision  
 
To support the Eastern Urban Extension, the following transport infrastructure will be provided:  
 
a) Provision of a new grade -separated junction to the A361 and road links into the site;  
b) Traffic calming and environm ental enhancement between Heathcoat Way and Putson Lane, 
including Blundell’s Road;  
c) Provision of bus, pedestrian and  cycle routes at appropriate locations throughout the 
developm ent, creating an attractive, permeable network for non -car modes travelling within, into 
and out of t he area;  
d) Cycle and pedestrian links to the  Railway Walk, Grand Western Canal and nearby public rights of 
way;  
e) Implementation of Travel Plans and ot her non -traditional transport measures to minimise carbon 
footprint and air quality impacts;  
f) Bus ser vice enhancements betwee n the main residential areas of Tiverton and the employment 
areas within the Eastern Urban Extension;  
g) Bus service enhancements between Exeter, Tiverton Bus Sta tion, the Eastern Urban Extension 
and Tiverton Parkway Station; and  
h) New and improved offsite pedestri an and cycle links including improvements to a wider green 
infrastructure network.  
 
3.13 The provision of appropriate transport infrastructure is a key requirement of the urban extension, minimising 
impact on adjoining us es and promoting sustainable development.  The key items of transport infrastructure are set 
out in the masterplan which was adopted in April 2014.   
 
3.14 A direct access to the A361 will ensure that the site is both attractive for employment growth, and minimises 
the impact of traffic on other surrounding routes.  The new junction is to be provided early in the development, along 
with improvements to Blundell’s  Road and traffic calming measures to ensure a safe environment for all users of the 55 
 highway and  adjacent land.  The first phase of Blundell’s  Road traffic calming and environmental enhancement has 
been implemented.  
 
3.15 It is expected that the junction onto the A361 will be achieved through a combination of developer and public 
funding.  The Tivert on Eastern Urban Extension is excluded from the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) which 
applies elsewhere in the district, so the provision of infrastructure including financial contributions for bus service 
enhancements will be secured through planning obligations (Section 106 Agreements).  
 
3.16 The final number of dwellings on the site will be established following a further masterplanning  exercise in 
relation  to Area B.  However, additional development of this site or further expansion to the east if exceeding 2,000 
dwellings  would likely trigger a requirement for a second access onto Heathcoat Way.  Devon County Council has 
considered options for the route of this road, should it be required in the future.  
 
3.17 Appropriate traffic calming and environ mental enhancement along Blundell’s Road together with cycle and 
pedestrian facilities have the opportunity to create an attractive sustainable transport corridor that respects the setting 
and operation of Blundell’s School and the residential environment of the area. Devon County Council as Highway 
Authority will prepare a detailed design, subject to consultation.   
 
3.18 It is essential that the development is served by an attractive, convenient and safe network of sustainable 
transport routes, including bus, cycle and pedestrian. Streets appropriate for bus use should be provided so that as far 
as possible, all buildings are within 400 metres of a bus route. The existing Blundell’s Road and the A361 link will 
need to be included in these routes, together with appropriate streets within the urban extension. It is equally 
important that cyclists have access to safe, attractive and direct cycle routes within the urban extension, linking 
together the dwellings, businesses and services in a network. These shoul d link to the existing cycling and walking 
provision in the surrounding area, particularly the Railway Walk and Grand Western Canal (both part of the National 
Cycle Network) and public rights of way. The provision of Green Infrastructure will provide oppor tunities for off -road 
cycling and walking routes. The aim will be to integrate these sustainable transport provisions into the wide r Tiverton  
area and surrounding countryside as far as possible.   
 
3.19 There will be the need for developers to prepare and i mplement Travel Plans for the development as a whole 
and for the constituent parts, to promote softer and other less traditional measures relating to transport.  
 
3.20 A major development must be served by high quality public transport in order to maximise  its potential for 
sustainability and encourage alternatives to use of the car where possible. The urban extension will provide new 
commercial space serving Tiverton and therefore it is important that the existing residential areas of the town have 
improve d public transport access to it. As a major new residential area, it is also important that residents of the 
extension can access key locations by public transport. A service linking Exeter, the Bus Station and Tiverton Parkway 
Rail Station via the Eastern  Urban Extension would make a significant contribution in this regard and reduce the 
carbon footprint of the development. Support of appropriate bus services will be required from the development for a 
minimum period of 5 years.  
 
  56 
 Policy TIV3 
 
Eastern Urb an Extension Environmental Protection  and Green Infrastructure  
 
As part of the Eastern Urban Extension, the following environmental protection and enhancement 
measures will be implemented at the expense of all new development in the Eastern Urban Extensio n: 
 
a) Measures to protect and enhance trees, hedgerows and other environmental features which 
contribute to th e character and biodiversity, maintaining a wildlife network within the site and 
linking to the surrounding countryside;  
b) Provision and managem ent of 47 hectares of land for strategic green infrastructure on the 
western and southern edges of the urban extension,   including management and funding 
arrangements for the protection and enhancement of Tidcombe Fen Site of Speci al Scientific 
Interest,  its catchment and land west of Pool Anthony Bridge;  
c) Areas of equipped and laid out public open space, totalling 2 hectares of children’s play, 8 
hectares of sports pitches and 2 hectares of allotments;  
d) A strategic landscaping and tree planting scheme  to mitigate landscape impact, enhance 
biodiversity and the character of development;  
e) Appropriate provision of a sewerage system to serve the development ; 
f) The provision of a strategic Sustainable U rban Drainage Scheme provided in step with 
developmen t to deal with  all surface water from the development, paying particular attention  in 
relation to runoff into Tidcombe Fen SSSI in terms of quality and quantity of water entering the 
fen, and arrangements for future maintenance of the scheme;   
g) Detailed archaeological investigation and measures to record,  and where necessary protect the 
archaeological interest of the site through appropriate design layout and mitigation; and  
h) Design solutions which respect the character a nd setting of heritage assets within and adjoining 
the site.  
 
3.21 A number of key environmental requirements arise from the Eastern Urban Extension, to protect existing 
features of national and local importance, and to ensure that the development contributes to enhancements in the 
local environment.  
 
3.22 Tidcombe Fen, which lies between Tiverton and the main part of the Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension, is a 
10.7 hectare Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and as such must be protected.  The site was notified in 1988 
and is a typ e of wetland habitat rare in Devon.  There is a wide variety of plant species unusual in its diversity, and 
fauna includes rare snail species.  Active management of this habitat is currently undertaken by a local trust.  One of 
the key issues is the impact  of development on the quality and flows of water entering the SSSI, and its water levels.  
Avoidance of harm to its catchment area is therefore vital.  A contribution to continued management of the SSSI and 
its catchment will be required.  
 
3.23 There are a number of other areas of biodiversity interest within and adjoining the area of the urban extension 
and measures will need to be incorporated which protect and enhance their value.  The Grand Western Canal is a 
designated County Wildlife Site and a subst antial buffer zone will be retained between the canal and the development 
to preserve its special environmental quality.  The layout of the development should promote the continued use of 
species -rich hedgerows as wildlife corridors, acting to prevent thei r fragmentation and providing appropriate treatment 
where such corridors cross roads and other linear features.  
 
3.24 The provision of public open space for local benefits and for the wider benefit of Tiverton will be important in 
defining the character of  the urban extension.  The adopted masterplan provides for at least two hectares each of 
children’s play space and allotments, while eight hectares for sports pitches will be provided through a combination of 
onsite pitches and new or improved sports provi sion elsewhere in Tiverton.   
 57 
 3.25 The development will need to take a strategic approach to Sustainable Urban Drainage to ensure that there is 
no additional run -off from the site arising from the development. This is in order to avoid an increase in floo d risk on 
site and downstream. Particular care will be required in relation to runoff into the Tidcombe Fen SSSI to ensure that 
the quantity and quality of water entering the Fen and its catchment are carefully controlled.  
 
3.26 There are various heritage assets in and around the site, including listed buildings, scheduled ancient 
monuments, the Grand Western Canal and Blundell’s Conservation Area.  The site is also within the defined ‘setting 
area’ for Knightshayes Court, which is on the national register of historic parks and gardens.  The development must 
have appropriate regard to the character and setting of all heritage assets affected.  The urban extension also 
occupies an area of known archaeological potential, in particular with regard to prehistori c activity. There are two 
archaeological funerary sites of national importance just outside the development site that are Scheduled Ancient 
Monuments. Further archaeological assessment will be required across the Eastern Urban Extension site.  
 
 
Policy TIV4 
 
Eastern Urban Extension Community Facilities  
 
 
As part of the Eastern Urban Extension, the following community infrastructure will be provided at the 
expense of all new development in the urban extension area:  
 
a) One serviced site of 1.93 hectares for a primary school at no cost to the Local Education 
Authority;  
b) Provision of a 420 -place primary school with early years provision and a children’s centre service 
delivery base funded by appropriate contributions from developers ;  
c) A site of 2.0 hectare s for a shopping and community centre, of which 1.0 hectare will be for 
community buildings at no cost to the provider;  
d) Contribution to new and improved facilities at the secondary school; and  
e) Construction cost of appropriate community facilities and  buildings including youth and 
children’s provision and a community hall ; 
f)  Contributions towards a new recycling centre to serve Tiverton.   
 
3.27 The creation of a genuine urban extension requires that the residents and workers have access to a range of  
community facilities within easy walking or cycling distance, thereby discouraging car trips for essential local 
purposes.  It is also important that, as far as possible, the development of this site will not lead to unacceptable 
pressures on existing ser vices and facilities within Tiverton and the wider area.  Accordingly, this policy sets out the 
requirements for provision of community facilities within the development and elsewhere.  
 
3.28 The adopted masterplan includes a phasing plan which ensures a ne w primary school is provided at no cost 
to the Local Education Authority at an appropriate point in the development.  The development will also need to 
provide new and enhanced secondary provision to accommodate the demand it will generate. The Education A uthority 
has undertaken a feasibility study in respect of expansion and enhancement of Tiverton High School. Enhancements 
may include an expansion of the school site.  A neighbourhood centre will also be provided within the urban extension 
site to act as a  community focal point and located in conjunction with the primary school. The neighbourhood centre 
will include shops to meet local, convenience needs and community facilities including a community meeting space 
and youth provision.  It may also form the location for local medical facilities, child care and small -scale offices. An 
element of residential accommodation may also be appropriate as part of a mixed use approach.  
 
 58 
 Policy TIV5 
 
Eastern Urban Extension Phasing  
 
 
The development of the Eastern Urba n Extension must be carried out in accordance with an approved 
phasing strategy, to ensure that the development and infrastructure come forward in step, minimising 
the impact of the development and taking account of the need for development to remain viabl e.  
Detailed justification must be provided if there is any proposed deviation from the following 
requirements:  
 
a) The provision of on and off slip roads on the south side of the A361 to a standard suitable to form 
construction access prior to any develo pment;  
b) The provision of the completed on and off slip roads on the south side of the A361 (forming the 
southern element of the A361 junction) and the highway link between this junction and Blundell’s 
Road prior to the occupation of any development;  
c) The occupation of no more than 200 dwellings or 4,000 square metres  employment floorspace 
before the provision of a ‘Phase 1’ traffic calming scheme at Blundell’s School and improvements 
to the roundabouts at  Heathcoat Way and Lowman Way, as set out in the adopted masterplan;  
d) Prior to the commencement of construction south of Blundell’s Road the transfer of land for the 
primary school and its access to the Local Education  Authority;  
e) Prior to the first occupation of development south of Blundell’s Road the servicing of the site for 
the primary school;  
f) The occupation of no more than 400 dwellings before the construction of the first phase of the 
primary school;  
g) The occupation of no more than 400 dwellings before the provision of temporary open space  on 
the future school and neighbourhood centre site;  
h) The occupation of no more than 600 dwellings or 10,000 square metres commercial floorspace 
before the completion of the full movement grade  separated junction to the A361 and completion 
of the traffic  calming and environmental enhancement of Blundell’s Road between Putson Lane 
and Heathcoat Way;  
i) The occupation on no more than 600 dwellings before the implementation  of arrangements for the 
management and funding for the Green Infrastructure west of P ool Anthony Bridge;  
j) The occupation of no more than 600 dwellings before the implementation of bus service 
enhancements;  
k) The occupation of no more than 600 dwellings before the provision of a  2.0 ha serviced 
neighbourhood centre site;  
l) The occupatio n of no more than 1000 dwellings before the provision of Green Infrastructure 
between Pool Anthony Bridge and Manley Railway Bridge within Area A as defined in the adopted 
masterplan, with necessary management and funding arrangements;  
m) The occupation o f no more than 1250 dwellings before the provision of  Green Infrastructure 
between Pool Anthony Railway Bridge and Manley Railway Bridge within the Area B as defined in 
the adopted masterplan, with necessary management and funding arrangements; and  
n) Phased delivery of cycle and pedestrian links to the railway walk, Grand Western Canal and 
nearby public rights of way.  
 
3.29 The phasing of development will have a key influence on the impact on surrounding areas, but also on the 
viability of development.  T he above policy sets out the approach to phasing which has been negotiated and agreed 
through the adoption of the masterplan as a Supplementary Planning Document.  Legal obligations and conditions on 
planning consents will be used to control these phasing requirements. Other features such as sustainable urban 
drainage and linking pipework should be integrated and phased appropriately in step with development.  
 59 
 3.30 The provision of a new junction onto the A361 is critical to the success of the scheme, to p revent 
unacceptable increases in traffic along Blundell’s Road and allow commercial development in the northwest corner of 
the site to be delivered.  Given the expense of building new roads, construction of the new junction will take place in 
phases but is  required early in the development.   
 
3.31 Public open space and pedestrian and cycle links will be expected to come forward in pace with the 
development rather than a specific trigger point being identified for provision.  The provision of affordable hou sing will 
be subject to viability assessment as each phase of the development is proposed in more detail through a planning 
application.   
 
3.32 The adopted masterplan sets out areas of the site (A and B), with more detailed survey and design work 
having b een included for Area A.  The phasing and delivery of green infrastructure should be further informed by an 
additional Masterplanning exercise for Area B to the southeast of the site, which is expected to be delivered after Area 
A.   
 
3.33 It is expected t hat a serviced site for the neighbourhood centre will be provided no later than the occupation of 
600 dwellings, but may be as early as the commencement of construction to the south of Blundell’s Road. The 
Masterplan SPD identifies that the construction of  community facilities within the neighbourhood centre will commence 
within phase 1b and will be built out by the end of phase 1c (up to 1000 dwellings). The funding and timing of the 
provision of community facilities will be secured via a planning obligati on (Section 106 Agreement) at planning 
application stage.  
 
3.34 The provision of land for the new primary school and the construction of its first phase are timed to allow the 
Education Authority to secure the site at an early stage in order to plan for a nd meet the need arising from the new 
development. No specific trigger is set out for enhanced secondary education. This will be expected to be provided in 
pace with developme nt in order to meets its needs.  
 
Policy TIV6 
 
Farleigh Meadows  
 
 
A site of 11.2 hectares at Farleigh Meadows is allocated for residential development, subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 255 dwellings on land in Flood Zone 1, with 35% affordable housing;  
b) 3 hectares of informal amenity open space within the floodplain with  appropriate sec urity 
measures to prevent access to and pollution of the Mill Leat;  
c) Two vehicular access points;  
d) Cycle and pedestrian routes providing links between Rackenford Road, Higher Loughborough 
and Washfield Lane, incorporating and enhancing the Exe Valley W ay; 
e) Protection of oak trees subject to Tree Preservation Orders within the site, incorporated within 
public open space where appropriate;  
f) Careful design and landscaping treatment of the boundary between housing and amenity open 
space, taking account of impact on views from the north and east; and  
g) Measures to mitigate impact on air quality at Leat Street.  
 
3.35 This is a previously allocated site that has planning permission and has commenced development.  Of the 
11.2 hectare site, the eastern most  3 hectares are in Flood Zone 3 and therefore not suitable for housing 
development; this is proposed as informal space. The remaining 8.2 hectares has the capacity for 255 dwellings, 
taking account of the need to protect attractive mature trees within the site, which are subject to a Tree Preservation 60 
 Order. The Mill Leat which runs along the eastern edge of the proposed informal amenity open space, will need to be 
provided with  fencing and planting to ensure safety as well as avoidance of pollution to a vi tal water source for 
Heathcoat’s factory. This will have to retain access for maintenance. Discussion with Heathcoat Fabrics Ltd should 
take place around the necessary details.  
 
3.36 Two vehicular access points are required and gaps in the cycle and pedest rian routes in the vicinity will need 
to be addressed. In particular, the existing Exe Valley Way which runs through the site should be enhanced to provide 
pedestrian and cycle links to the south and north. Leat Street, which is about 500m to the south eas t of this site, has 
poor air quality, and this site has the potential to worsen this through traffic generation.  Where significant change is 
proposed to the existing consented scheme, updated studies of the potential impact will be required and should fun d 
relevant measures to mitigate any impact. The site has the potential to impact on views from Knightshayes, a Historic 
Park and Garden, and this should be considered in the layout, design and landscaping.  
 
3.37 An outline application for development at F arleigh Meadows was granted permission for the erection of up to 
300 dwellings in 2013 , which was reduced to 255 dwellings at reserved  matters stage . Both applications  met the 
requirements of the policy including agreement to maintain a 35% affordable hous ing target. The affordable housing 
percentage of 35% is retained in the policy to reflect the planning permission that was granted, as that percentage 
was clearly considered viable for this development.  Any revised scheme will be considered against this t arget and 
evidence would be required to justify any proposed reduction.   
 
Policy TIV7 
 
Town Hall / St Andrew Street  
 
A site of 0.5 hectares at St Andrew Street is allocated for residential development as follows:  
 
a) 59 dwellings, incorporating conversio n of buildings adjoining St Andrew Street, including 28% 
affordable housing;  
b) Design which protects the character and setting of heritage assets both onsite and adjoining the 
site, and enhances the setting of the River Exe;  
c) Archaeological investigatio n and appropriate mitigation; and  
d) Ground floors to be raised and provision of flood evacuation/ access routes.  
 
3.38 An application for development at St Andrew Street was granted permission in 2013 for the erection 45 
apartments for older persons, exclu ding the 14 dwellings to be provided through the conversion of buildings adjoining 
St Andrew Street. The proposal met the requirements of the site allocation policy with the exception of affordable 
housing provision, which was considered financially justif ied. As the new build part of this development has not been 
built out, it is considered appropriate to include a policy target of 28% affordable housing to reflect the Council’s 
viability evidence.  Any revised scheme submitted in the future would need to be assessed against the criteria of the 
policy above and market conditions prevalent at that time.  
 
3.39 The design of this site is important as it is a highly visible site from the direction of the river. A scheme should 
enhance the views of the Conservat ion Area from this direction, while respecting the character and setting of the 
associated listed buildings. As a central site, there is the potential for archaeological remains, and this should be 
investigated. The site is within the 100 year floodplain, although behind a flood wall. Due to its regeneration 
importance to the town centre, the site passes the relevant sequential test set out in national guidance. Where 
appropriate the provision of raised floor levels and access/egress to dry land in the even t of flooding should be 
provided.

 Policy TIV8 
 
Moorhayes Park  
 
 
A site of 0.4 hectares at Moorhayes Park is allocated for residential development, subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 8 dwellings;  
b) Access to be provided from Hayne Court; and  
c) Archaeological  investigation and appropriate mitigation.  
 
3.40 This site is located within Moorhayes Park and is bounded by the A361 to the north, modern housing to the 
east and is adjacent to a transformer station to the west.  It is currently an overgrown area and not  in use.  The site 
falls within the built up area of Tiverton and as a result it is likely that there will be no landscape impact. An existing 
access from Hayne Court is suitable. It is in an area of known prehistoric activity and appropriate archaeologica l 
investigation would be required.  A preliminary ecological appraisal has been undertaken which concludes that the site 
is of limited ecological value. The town leat runs to the east of the site. A flood risk assessment will need to consider 
the potential  for flooding from the leat including a scenario of blockage of local culverts /bridges that convey the leat.  
 
3.41 Planning permission has been granted for the development of this site, including one affordable dwelling.  Any 
revised scheme will be expecte d to meet the latest policy criteria for affordable housing.   
 
Policy TIV9 
 
Howden Court  
 
A site of 0.53 hectares at Howden Court is allocate d for residential development, subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 10 dwellings;  
b) Submission of a Junction Capacity A ssessment to determine the need for a right turning lane 
from the A396 if accessed via the Howden Court development ; and  
c) Provision of a pedestrian and cycle route from Howden Court to Palmerston Park.  
 
3.42 This site is located on the western edge of Ti verton bounded by residential development to the east. This site 
is the remaining part of a previous allocation for 65 dwellings, of which 50 have been built or are committed.  On the 
advice of the Highway Authority , if the site is accessed via the  adjacen t Howden Court development, it  may need to be 
served by a right turning lane from the A396, as cumulatively the housing will exceed 50 dwellings.   Any planning 
application should be accompanied by a Junction Capacity Assessment which should assess the nee d for the right 
turning lane as a result of the additional development being proposed on the site.  
 62 
 Policy TIV10 
 
Roundhill  
 
A site of 0.4 hectares at Roundhill is allocated for residential development, subject to the following:  
 
a) 20 affordable dwellin gs; and  
b) Investigation of ground stability and implementation of appropriate remediation works.  
 
3.43 The site comprises underused garages in the Council’s ownership with existing housing to the north, south 
and east. It is a brownfield site and can be made available for 100% affordable housing. A number of dwellings 
adjoining the site have rights of access over part of it and these will need to be maintained as part of the development.  
Approximately 35 car parking spaces and garages will be retained/pr ovided on the site as part of the redevelopment.  
Potential mineshafts may be found in the area; appropriate investigations will need to be undertaken and sho uld 
accompany any application.  
 
Policy TIV11 
 
Palmerston Park  
 
A site of 0.9 hectares at Palmers ton Park is allocated for residential development subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 25 affordable dwellings;  
b) Habitat and protected species reports including a programme of appropriate mitigation and 
compensation for loss of any protected habitat or species  if appropriate; and  
c) Investigation of ground stability and implementation of appropriate  remediation works.  
 
3.44 This site lies to the west of Tiverton adjacent to Palmerston Park and close to Howden Industrial Estate.  It 
was previously used as allotm ents but is now unused and overgrown.  The land is steeply sloping upwards to the 
west. It is well screened from the east by sycamore trees and high banks.  The northern half of the site is deciduous 
woodland, classed as a priority habitat in the UK Biodiv ersity Action Plan.  A habitat survey of the site will be required 
to establish in more detail the characteristics of the woodland, the importance of the habitat, and identify mitigation or 
compensation that may be required.   
 
3.45 The site is in the Coun cil’s ownership and can be made available for 100% affordable housing which is a 
considerable benefit arising from development of this site. There is a potential impact on the landscape character due 
to the loss of trees on the elevated part of the site. T he site is visible from the east side of the River Exe.  The impact 
on the landscape will require careful treatment. Potential mineshafts may be found in the area; appropriate 
investigations will need to be undertaken and should accompany any application. The site is expected to 
accommodate 25 dwellings, avoiding development of the higher, steeply sloping part of the site.

 Policy TIV12 
 
Phoenix Lane  
 
 
A site of 1.4 hectares at Phoenix Lane is allocated for redevelopment as a high quality shopping, 
leisure and residential area with accessible public space.  Redevelopment is subject to the following:  
 
a) 60 dwellings with 28% affordable housing;  
b) 7,000 square metres of mixed commercial floorspace in cluding retail, office  and leisure uses;  
c) Redesign an d enhancement of the bus station to include an improved, safe  and attractive 
passenger waiting area wit h adequate provision for buses and taxi ranks;  
d) Improved pedestrian access between Phoenix Lane and the Pannier market, and between Phoenix 
Lane and th e multi -storey car park;  
e) Retention or relocation of the war memorial within the Town Centre;  
f) Outstanding design that announces the southern entrance to Tiverton’s primary shopping area 
while respecting and enhancing the character, appearance and sett ing of heritage assets and 
steep open hillsides;  
g) Retention of the listed building, Gotham House, and measures to protect its character, 
appearance and setting including the protection of the Town Leat;  
h) Adequate parking and service areas to serve the needs of existing and  proposed uses;  
i) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation;  
j) Provision of a Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme to deal with all surface water from the 
development and arrangements for future maintenance; and  
k) Compre hensive Masterplanning of the development including at least two stages of public 
consultation and adoption of the Masterplan  as a Supplementary Planning Document, before any 
planning application is determined.  
 
3.46 The Mid Devon Retail Study (2012) ident ifies Phoenix Lane as an area suitable for retail development.  At 
present it is a wide pedestrianised road providing a link between the multi -storey car park and bus station to the core 
shopping area of Tiverton.  However, the street is wider than necessa ry and redevelopment could provide an 
attractive shopping frontage with residential accommodation above.  There are also opportunities to improve the bus 
station and links to the Pannier Market and the multi -storey car park.  Masterplanning of Tiverton tow n centre is in 
progress to identify the best ways of enhancing the town centre’s attractiveness as a destination for tourism, shopping 
and leisure.  
 
3.47 High quality design will be crucial to the success of redevelopment of this area.  It is essential tha t the historic 
character of the town centre is respected, the setting of important listed buildings preserved, and views in and out of 
the conservation area sensitively treated.  Gotham House, a Grade II* listed building, must be retained and its 
character  respected, though the redevelopment may include the conversion of this building to residential 
accommodation, subject to detailed plans.  The bus station and car park are the main point of entrance to the town 
centre for visitors, so the development must improve and enhance the visual quality of this area and the perception of 
Tiverton town centre as a whole.

 Policy TIV13 
 
Tidcombe Hall CONTINGENCY SITE  
 
A site of 8.4 hectares at Tidcombe Hall is identified as a contingency site for residential develop ment 
to be released in accordance with Policy S4, subject to the following:  
 
a) 100 dwellings with 28% affordable housing;  
b) Vehicular access point on to Canal Hill and improvements to Tidcombe Lane northwards from the 
site; 
c) Walking and cycling enhance ments and connection to surrounding public rights of way and green 
infrastructure networks;  
d) Design and landscaping which protects the setting of the Grand Western Canal, Tidcombe Hall 
and Conservation Areas; and  
e) Archaeological investigations and appr opriate mitigation measures.  
 
3.48 This site is primarily greenfield and is identified as a contingency site to be released in accordance with Policy 
S4. Whilst acceptable in some respects there are a number of constraints which make it less suitable than the sites 
allocated in the Local Plan, including landscape and highway constraints that need to be mitigated.  
 
3.49 The site adjoins the south eastern limits of Tiverton. It extends from the grounds of Tidcombe Hall southwards 
including agricultural land a s far as Newts Hill. Rising generally from north to south, it is more prominent at its south 
west corner.  Although the site could accommodate more than 100 dwellings, a lower density would help protect the 
setting of the canal and Tidcombe Hall.  The site  is adjacent to residential development to the west, and low density 
reflecting this existing development would be appropriate.  
 
3.50 The northern part of the site at Tidcombe Hall lies within the Grand Western Canal Conservation Area and 
faces the canal i tself, which is also a Country Park. Tidcombe Hall is an unlisted building but is considered a heritage 
asset and the setting should be respected. Development to the south and east of the hall may be significant. Design 
and landscaping should protect Tidco mbe Hall and the Grand Western Canal Conservation Area from the impact of 
the development including their settings. There is potential for archaeological remains that should be surveyed with 
appropriate mitigation provided if necessary.  
 
3.51 A key factor  is access. Tidcombe Lane has limited width without footways and Tidcombe Bridge is very 
narrow. Improvements to Tidcombe Lane will be necessary northwards from the site to ensure the safety of 
pedestrians, although not necessarily to increase its traffic capacity. A single vehicular access point on to Canal Hill 
will need to be supplemented with a secondary emergency access designed to be located at the end of the main cul -
de-sac within the site.  
 
3.52 A watercourse runs through the site and this should be  preserved as part of the open space provision. A flood 
risk assessment will need to consider the potential for this watercourse to cause flooding.

 Policy TIV15  
 
Tiverton Infrastructure  
 
The Council will work with partners to deliver the following inf rastructure for Tiverton:  
 
a) Provision of a new junction onto the A361 to serve the Tiverton Eastern  Urban Extension;  
b)  Traffic calming and environmental enhancement to Blundell’s Road in association with the  
Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension;  
c)  Provis ion of increased capacity at roundabouts on Heathcoat Way;  
d)  Bus service enhancements;  
e)  Expansion and improvement of primary and secondary education facilities;  
f)  Public open space and green infrastructure;  
g)  Expansion of emergency fire and rescu e services;  
h)  Provision of healthcare facilities;  
i)  Enhanced library service provision;  
j)  Community facilities including provision for children/youth, a GP surgery and community hall;  
k)  Provision of works to reduce flood risk ; and  
l)  Provision o f a replacement recycling centre facility . 
 
3.58 Strategic Local Plan sites will be required to pay for specific items of infrastructure that are necessary to make 
the development acceptable.  Other development (if eligible) will be charged the Community I nfrastructure Levy (CIL) 
at a rate per square metre.   CIL funds will be spent according to a prescribed list of infrastructure projects or types of 
infrastructure.  
 
3.59 The Council’s strategic infrastructure policy is set out earlier in the Local Plan u nder Policy S8, but there are 
infrastructure requirements specific to Tiverton that are listed under Policy TIV15.  The Council will use CIL, planning 
obligations for strategic sites and other sources of funding to deliver the infrastructure listed whereve r possible.  The 
Council’s Regulation 123 list and accompanying policy on the use of Section 106 agreements, sets out the 
mechanism to be used to fund infrastructure. Where another organisation is responsible for delivering the 
infrastructure required as a  result of new development, the Council will work in partnership with the relevant bodies to 
ensure that infrastructure needs associated with development are addressed appropriately.    
 
3.60 Devon County Council’s Waste Plan  (adopted December 2014) , allocates a site in Tiverton for the delivery of 
an Energy from Waste plant.  A site within the Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension has been identified, being located in 
relatively close proximity to other development, allowing energy and heat recovered from the d isposal of waste to be 
exported to nearby properties and businesses.  The facility is included in Mid Devon’s Infrastructure Plan as an 
important piece of local infrastructure, though it is expected it would be fully funded by a private sector waste 
compan y, with no funds being required from developer contributions or CIL.

 Policy TIV16  
 
Blundell’s  School  
 
A site of 14 hectares north of Blundell’s  School is allocated for residential development  subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 200 dwellings with 28% affordabl e housing;  
b)  Approximately 8 hectares of informal green infrastructure adjoining the River Lowman;  
c)  Appropriate land shaping to raise areas for development above flood zone 3, including an 
allowance for the effects of climate change and to create addi tional floodplain to compensate for 
the loss of floodplain;  
d)  Provision of a junction on Heathcoat Way and a safeguarded road route through the site to serve 
as a future second strategic road access for development at Tiverton eastern urban extension;  
e)  Provision and enhancement of cycle and pedestrian links in the area;  
f)  Site contamination assessment and remediation measures  to mitigate risks  associated with 
former and current land -uses including the scrapyard and former poultry factory;   
g)  Provis ion of a sustainable urban drainage scheme to deal with all surface water from the 
development and arrangements for future maintenance;  
h)   Implementation of transport plans and other non -traditional transport measures to minimise 
carbon footprint and air  quality impacts;  
i) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation ;  
j) Design which respects and enhances the character and appearance of the   
 Conservation Area ; and  
k) The creation of additional/compensatory floodplain should secure wider env ironmental and 
sustainability benefits .  
 
3.60a  Land to the north of Blundell’s  Road in the vicinity of Blundell’s  School consists of a mix of Greenfield and 
brownfield land,  including unattractive buildings no longer in use, in and adjoining the floodpla in of the River Lowman. 
Current and former uses have the potential to cause contamination, including an impact on river quality, and 
development of this area has the potential to resolve such issues. The site is bounded by development to three sides, 
with the River Lowman forming the northern boundary. Most of the site was previously allocated for an extension to 
the Tiverton Business Park, which lies north of the river.  
 
3.60b  The owners have pre viously confirmed availability and have sought allocation of  the site, supporting the view 
that the site is viable. It is suitable for a relatively high density of development, as it would adjoin a large area of publ ic 
open space. It is proposed to bring forward the residential element of the allocation from the pr evious plan (Allocations 
and Infrastructure DPD 2011).  
 
3.60c  The flooding issues associated with the development of this site have been examined. The regeneration and 
sustainability benefits arising from redevelopment are sufficient that the sequential t est set out in national policy is 
overcome, and the measures set out in the policy overcome the exceptions tests. The policy requires that remodelling 
of the site be carried out, in order to raise certain areas and lower others, the end result being no cha nge to the 
functionality of the floodplain to deal with a 1:100 year return period flood event, including appropriate allowance for 
the effects of climate change. This remodelling would create a total of 6 hectares of developable land along the 
southern ed ge of the site, and 8 hectares of floodplain, which would be provided as Green Infrastructure. The 
Environment Agency has indicated that it is supportive of the carrying forward of the allocation given the opportunity it 
provides to assist in the provision  of wider flood risk mitigation proposals in this area of the River Lowman , subject to 
the provision of wider environmental and sustainability benefits .  
 
3.60d  The western end of Blundell’s  Road has air quality issues which have been within about 15% of exceeding the 
relevant guidelines. Additional road traffic from this site has the potential to bring this permanently over the relevant 67 
 limits if access is obtained from Blundell’s  Road. Accordingly, access to the site is proposed to be direct from 
Heathco at Way via a new junction. The design and location of this junction and site access may in the future form part 
of a second strategic access to the Eastern Urban Extension. The development of this site will need to ensure that any 
future route through it t o service the Eastern Urban Extension is not precluded. Non -vehicular access into and through 
the site should also be enhanced, through new and improved cycle and pedestrian routes including non -vehicular links 
to Blundell’s  Road. An air quality assessment  will be required with any application.  
 
3.60e  The site contains a working scrapyard, adjoining the River Lowman, which has the potential to harm water 
quality. Its removal and clean -up of the site would be a particular benefit, and is a key justification  for this allocation. 
Similarly, the former poultry factory on the site may be contaminated and is becoming increasingly derelict. It would be 
inappropriate to allow redevelopment of land within the site for new housing before the removal of the scrapyard,  
given the impact on the living conditions and health of occupiers arising from its continued operation. Accordingly, no 
residential development will be permitted on the site until the scrapyard has been removed and the site remediated. 
Appropriate measure s, agreed with the Council, will be needed to allow the site’s development.  
 
3.60f  Provision of a Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme will be req uired, to deal with the quality and quantity of 
surface water.

 Cullompton 
 
3.61 Cullompton will develop as a fast growing market town and will become the principal focus of development for 
the district in the medium to long term in accordance with the development strategy set out in Policy S11.  
 
3.62 Cullompton Town Council is preparing a neighbourhood plan which  may contain policies and site allocations 
additional to those in the Local Plan.  The neighbourhood plan is subject to a separate process of consultation and 
examination.  Local Plan allocations to the north -west and east of Cullompton have strategic impl ications for Mid 
Devon and neighbouring districts, particularly with regard to impacts on the strategic road network.  The Local Plan 
takes precedence over any neighbourhood plan where strategic policies are concerned.

3.65 The remaining housing sites have been g ranted planning approval and are now wholly or partially 
implemented. These sites are: Knowle Lane (CU13), Land at Exeter Road (CU15) and Cummings Nursery (CU16).    
 
3.66 Land for commercial devel opment is allocated within the n orth-west and east Cull ompto n urban extensions . 
Allocated sites at Week Farm and Venn Farm in the Kingsmill area now have planning permission.   
 
3.67 The amount of floorspace to be provided by commercial development depends on the use.  For instance, 
office development on multiple f loors provides a greater amount of floorspace per hectare than a single -storey 69 
 warehouse, and some commercial uses require more land for parking than others.  Floorspace assumptions for 
different uses are set out in the methodology for Strategic Commercial  Land Availability Assessment (SCLAA), but the 
Council recognises that this is only a starting point and a higher or lower density of development may be justified 
depending on the nature of the proposal that comes forward.

North West Cullompton  
 
A site of 100 hectares to the North West of Cullompton is allocated for mixed use development subject 
to the following:  
 
a) 1350  dwellings with 28% affordable housing to include at least five pitches for gypsies and 
travellers and provision of extra care housing;   
b) 5% of housing to be provided as serviced plots for sale to self -builders;  
c) 10,000 square metres commercial floorspace to include a care home or retirement complex, and 
other suitable uses such as a hotel o r leisure development;  
d) Provision of at least 28 hectares strategic green infrastructure;  
e) Provision of a road linking Tiverton Road to Willand Road, and transport provision to ensure 
appropriate accessibility for all modes;  
f) Environmental protectio n and enhancement;  
g) Community facilities and primary school to meet local needs arising;  
h) Carbon reduction and air quality improvements;  
i) An agreed phasing strategy to bring forward development and infrastructure in step and retain the 
overall viabi lity of development; and  
j) Comprehensive Masterplanning of the development including at least two stages of public 
consultation and adoption of the Masterplan  as a Supplementary Planning Document, before any 
planning application is determined.  
 
3.68 Land  to the north -west of Cullompton is currently in agricultural use.  The western boundaries are formed by 
hedgerows, the eastern by Willand Road and the adjoining development.  The southern end of the site wraps around 
the steeper northern and western slope s of St Andrews Hill, its southern edge again formed by hedgerows and 
development.  A stream with a narrow flood plain runs west to east through the site, and another stream forms the 
boundary at the northern end of the site.  
 
3.69 Development of this sit e must be carefully planned to ensure that impact on the landscape is minimised 
through measures such as avoiding the development of higher ground, appropriate landscaping and ensuring that 
areas at risk of flooding remain undeveloped.  
 
3.70 There are sev ere traffic congestion problems on Cullompton High Street and at its junction with Tiverton 
Road, having an adverse effect on air quality, living conditions and the attractiveness of the town centre.  This 
development will be required to provide a road lin king Tiverton Road to Willand Road, not only diverting traffic from the 
new development away from the town centre but also providing an alternative route for other vehicles.  Traffic 
management measures on Willand Road and Tiverton Road will also be requir ed. Devon County Council queue length 
monitoring at junction 28 of the M5 motorway indicates congestion at the AM peak. The development will need to 
mitigate its impact upon the junction’s capacity through implementation of the Cullompton Town Centre Relie f Road.  
 
3.71 This development will also provide affordable housing including at least five gypsy and traveller pitches, 
contributing to the need identified in the Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (2015).  Part of the 
affordable housing provis ion should comprise extra care housing, which enables older people to live independently in 
homes that are purpose -built in clusters of 50 units, with 24 hour care and support services available onsite.   
 
3.72 In addition, provision of around 60 serviced plots for self -builders will diversify the choice of housing for 
potential residents, providing a low cost and reasonably straightforward option for those who wish to build their own 
home.  
 71 
 3.73 The Council will consider a range of commercial uses on this site, subject to masterplanning.  Industrial, 
warehouse and office development is primarily located on the east side of Cullompton, and not necessarily compatible 
with housing development, but this is a sustainable location for a number of other employment -generating uses.  The 
site should include a residential care or nursing home to account for the aging population, or another form of 
development for the elderly which generates sufficient jobs.  Self -contained retirement apartments where there is little 
or no onsite care will not be considered to constitute commercial development because they do not generate any 
significant number of jobs, but an extra care scheme or retirement ‘village’ or complex may be classed as commercial 
development if there will be a range of facilities and care services onsite.  The site may also include other leisure or 
hospitality uses in addition to community facilities, a new primary school and various forms of open space.   
 
3.74 The Local Plan sets out a framework for the deve lopment of North West Cullompton Urban Extension, but 
leaves many details for later consideration.  The preparation of a masterplan in consultation with stakeholders, 
including the local community, is an important step in achieving a comprehensive developm ent with wider community 
benefits.  The Council will resist ad -hoc development of phases with no reference to the overall vision and 
development strategy for the urban extension.  The developers will be expected to produce a number of further 
studies and s urveys to support the masterplan and work in partnership with the Council to achieve its adoption as a 
Supplementary Planning Document.   
 
 
Policy CU2 
 
North West Cullompton Transport Provision  
 
As part of the development of North West Cullompton, the foll owing transport infrastructure will be 
provided and funded by all new development within the site:  
 
a) Provision of a network of streets linking to the existing highway network, including a through 
route linking Tiverton Road to Willand Road suitable for b uses and all agricultural vehicles;  
b) Provision of bus, pedestrian and cycle routes at appropriate locations throughout the 
development, creating an attractive, permeable network for non -car modes travelling within, into 
and out of the area;  
c) Cycle and pedestrian links to and from the town centre and within the mixed -use urban extension;  
d) Implementation of travel plans and other non -traditional transport measures to minimise carbon 
footprint and air quality impacts;  
e) Financial contributions to b us se rvice enhancements within, into and out of,  the mixed -use urban 
extension;  
f) Financial contributions to b us service enhancements between Cullompton, Exeter, Tiverton 
Parkway and Tiverton ; 
g)  Financial contributions towards the Town Centre Relief Road and  traffic  management measures 
on Willand Road and Tiverton Road; and  
h)  Capacity improvements at junction 28 M5 , to deliver a strategic highway improvement as 
demonstrated by capacity studies completed to assess the impact of the traffic generated from 
the site.   
 
3.75 The provision of appropriate transport infrastructure is a key requirement of the development.  This can 
ensure that it is an attractive location for new development, that it minimises the impact on adjoining uses and accords 
with the need t o promote sustainable development.  The development will need to mitigate its impact upon capacity at 
junction 28 of the M5. The provision of a road through the site linking Tiverton Road to Willand Road will alleviate 
traffic congestion at the junction of  Tiverton Road and High Street, and in the town centre generally.  Combined with 
bus service enhancements and design which encourages non -car modes of travelling, this should reduce air 
pollutants in the town centre.  
 72 
 3.76 The development should be served  by an attractive, convenient and safe network of sustainable transport 
routes, including bus, cycle and pedestrian.  Streets appropriate for frequent bus routes should be provided so that as 
far as possible, all buildings are w ithin 400 metres of bus stop s. Applications will be expected to respond to these 
aspirations and as set out in the adopted masterplan SPD for the site. It is equally important that there is access to 
safe and direct cycle and pedestrian routes within the urban extension, linking toge ther the dwellings, commercial 
uses and services.  This can be achieved through the creation of off -road routes and also by ensuring that streets are 
designed appropriately for safe walking and cycling.  
 
3.77 The provision of green infrastructure as set o ut in Policy CU3 will provide opportunities for off -road cycling and 
walking routes.  These should be integrated into existing and proposed networks as far as possible.  The creation of 
additional public rights of way should be examined.   
 
3.78 Developers  will be expected to prepare and implement travel plans for the development as a whole and for its 
constituent parts, to promote non -traditional measures relating to transport that can help minimise the development’s 
carbon footprint and its impacts on air  quality.  
 
3.79 The development should be designed to be served by a permeable network of streets providing access 
to/from the development.  This should include a through -route linking Tiverton Road to Willand Road which is suitable 
for use as a bus route  and other traffic bypassing the town centre.  
 
 
Policy CU3 
 
North West Cullompton Environmental Protection and Green Infrastructure  
 
As part of the development of North West Cullompton, the following environmental protection and 
enhancement measures will  be provided and funded by all new development within the site:  
 
a) A strategic landscaping and tree planting scheme to protect and enhance trees, hedgerows and 
other environmental features which contribute to the character and biodiv ersity, maintaining a 
wildlife network within the site and linking to the surrounding countryside;  
b) An area of 28 hectares for strategic green infrastructure, laid out and managed with an 
appropriate mix of public parkland, open space, landscaping and potential local nature r eserve;  
c) Areas of equipped and laid out public open space, totalling 0.7 hectares of equipped play,  2.6 
hectares amenity open space, 4 hectares for parks, sports and recreation grounds, 0.7 hectares of 
allotments and 0.1 hectares for a community garden a djoining the health centre;  
d) Protection and enhancement where possible of all existing Public Rights of Way;  
e) Appropriate provision for sewerage systems serving the development, and provision of a 
strategically designed, and phased, Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme to deal with all surface 
water from the development and arrangements for future maintenance;  
f) Detailed archaeological investigation and measures to record, and where necessary, protect the 
archaeological interest of the site through appro priate design, layout and mitigation; and  
g) Design solutions which respect the settings of listed buildings within and adjoining the site.  
 
3.80 The area proposed as green infrastructure on this site will include land managed for public access and 
biodiv ersity, and will provide a new recreation facility for the town. There are a number of potentially species rich 
hedgerows within the development and further detailed study of these features will be necessary to confirm their 
potential.  The layout of devel opment should promote the continued use of wildlife corridors, including watercourses, 
acting to prevent their fragmentation and providing appropriate treatment where such corridors cross roads and other 
linear features. There is potential for off -road cyc le and pedestrian routes to follow these features, helping maintain 
their integrity. The requirement to extend the town cemetery, which adjoins this site, has been recognised in the 
proposals and has been extended .  73 
  
3.81 There is an area of flood plain as sociated with a watercourse running across the site from west to east. There 
are also a number of small watercourses running through the site for which flood risk and flood zone data is unknown. 
A flood risk assessment will need to consider the potential o f flooding along these watercourses. The layout of the 
development will need to take this into account.  Areas of floodplain should be retained as part of the strategic green 
infrastructure. The urbanisation of the area has the potential to increase surfac e water run -off elsewhere, through the 
loss of permeable surfaces. The inclusion of a sustainable urban drainage scheme (SUDS) approach for the entire 
development will ensure that there is no additional run -off from the site as a result of development.  Critical Drainage 
Area designation will require a net reduction in rain water runoff which affects parts of Willand Road and adjacent 
properties. Measures should be put in place to reduce this.  Sustainable urban drainage schemes usually involve the 
provision  of ponds, swales and other soft areas which can serve as a dual use for public open space and can be 
incorporated into wildlife networks. The role of landscaping and tree -planting in flood prevention should also be 
recognised in the development . A detaile d sustainable drainage strategy together with proposals for ongoing 
management and maintenance  for dealing with surface water must be prepared which builds on the high level 
approach set out in the adopted masterplan SPD in order  to determine the number, s ize and location of the required 
SUDS features.  
  
3.82 The development of this site will have an impact on the character of the area. The incorporation of appropriate 
landscaping and tree planting will act to mitigate this and should be designed to support  high quality green 
infrastructure areas and wildlife corridors.  Tree planting will also act to collect carbon dioxide, helping to reduce the 
overall carbon footprint of the scheme.  
 
3.83 Archaeological investigations in the area have demonstrated the pr esence of extensive and significant 
prehistoric and Romano -British sites. The Historic Environment Record notes the presence of prehistoric enclosures 
and funerary monuments within the area, as well as a findspot of a Saxon metal object and prehistoric fli nt tools. 
Development must take account of the setting of the St Andrews Hill Scheduled Monument, a Roman Fort. An 
archaeological assessment must be undertaken, the results of which should be taken into account during the 
masterplanning exercise to ensure protection where necessary.  
 
3.84 A number of listed buildings lie within or close to the area. The setting of these will need assessment and 
protection as part of the layout and design work and subsequent planning applications.  Careful consideration nee ds 
to be given to the design of the new roads through the site linking Tiverton Road to Willand Road. The cemetery and 
chapels could be closely affected by the road which runs close to the cemetery extension and could be prominent 
given the topography. App ropriate boundary treatments and screening is critical to mitigate any potential harm.

 Policy CU4  
 
North West Cullompton Community Facilities  
 
As part of the development of North West Cullompton, the following community infrastructure will be 
provided  and funded by all new development within the site:  
 
a) A serviced site of 2.1 hectares for a new primary school at no cost to the Local Education 
Authority;  
b) Provision of a 420 -place school with early years provision and a children’s centre service 
delivery base funded by appropriate  contributions from developers ; 
c) A site of 1.0 hectare for community uses including provision of a multi -purpose community 
building  
d) Contribution towards sporting and leisure facilities ; and  
e) Contributions towards a  new recycling centre to serve Cullompton .  
 
3.85 The creation of an urban extension requires that residents and workers have access to a range of community 
facilities within easy walking or cycling distance.  This will discourage trips by car for essential lo cal purposes.  It is 
also important that, as far as is possible, the development of the site does not result in unacceptable pressure on 
existing services and facilities within Cullompton and the surrounding area.  This policy sets out the requirements for  
provision of community facilities within the development site and elsewhere in the town.  
 
3.86 The provision of a new primary school in the urban extension will be required in order to provide local 
educational facilities for the resident school age chil dren.  The policy requires that the land for the school is serviced 
and provided free of charge to the education authority, within the timing of provision set out in the phasing policy and 
the adopted masterplan SPD .   
 
3.87 Development of this site will l ead to an increase in pressure on existing facilities and demand for new 
provision.  The construction of a community centre and provision of equipped and laid out public open space will be 
required within the site.  The location of community facilities has been established within the  masterplan for the site , to 
ensure the highest level of access for residents and other users.  
 
 
Policy CU5 
 
North West Cullompton Carbon Reduction and Air Quality  
 
The development of North West Cullompton will be required to i mplement a Carbon Reduction and 
Low Emissions Strategy funded by all new development in the site.  This will propose measures to 
minimise the overall carbon footprint of the development, making provision for sources of 
decentralised onsite renewable or low -carbon energy and ensure that impact of the site on air quality 
is acceptable, such as:  
 
a) Renewable and low carbon energy to provide a proportion of the site’s  energy use;  
b) Measures to ensure that residents, employees and businesses are encouraged to  travel in the 
most sustainable fashion, including travel plans, information, car clubs, lift -sharing and 
infrastructure for low  emission vehicles;  
c) Measures to encourage the sustainable treatment of waste;  
d) Measures to manage the impacts of constructi on; 
e) Offsite tree planting where sufficient cannot be accommodated onsite;  75 
 f) Energy improvements to existing buildings;  
g) Other measures to capture or mitigate carbon emissions and air quality impacts from 
development.  
 
3.88 The construction and use of  buildings has major implications for the use of non -renewable resources.  Fifty 
percent of the UK’s carbon emissions come from the construction and operation of the built environment.  As the 
population increases and climate changes, there is a clear need  to mitigate and adapt to climate change through 
effective carbon reduction and other methods.  
 
3.89 Policy CU5 ensures that methods of carbon reduction are considered and incorporated into the development 
where appropriate, such as carbon offsetting, tra vel plans and design which encourages sustainable ways of living. 
The combination of planning and building control should ensure a sustainable development that minimises carbon 
emissions from both housing and associated transport.  Further detail will be r equired through the masterplanning 
exercise and subsequent planning applications.  
 
3.90 Cullompton was declared an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) in 2006 and an Air Quality Action Plan 
was published in 2010. An assessment of the air quality impact of the potential development proposed in the Local 
Plan was undertaken in 2014. Findings indicate that no significant cumulative air quality effects, including the impact 
of the North West Cullompton development is anticipated as a result of the development o f sites set out in the Local 
Plan.  
 
 
Policy CU6 
 
North West Cullompton Phasing  
 
A phasing strategy will be required for the development of North West Cullompton to ensure that the 
development and infrastructure come forward in step, minimising the impact o f development while 
ensuring that the development remains viable.  The strategy should take account of the following 
requirements, variation of which will have to be carefully justified.  Development shall be subject to 
the following:  
 
a) Provision of affo rdable housing will be i n broad step with the market housing;  
b) Provision of all serviced self -build plots after the ‘through route’ linking  Tiverton Road to Willand 
Road is operational;  
c) Provision of commercial development after the delivery of the fir st 500   houses and prior to the 
delivery of the first 800 houses , at a rate of at least 0.9 hectare per 150 occupied dwellings 
thereafter;  
d) Provision of 8.8 hectares of strategic green infrastructure including  equipped public open space 
and one playing p itch prior to the occupation of no more than 500 dwellings;  
e) Implementation of local bus service improvements prior to the occupation of no more than 500 
dwellings and strategic bus service enhancements phased with  development;  
f) Occupation of no more t han 500 dwellings before the opening of a ‘through route’ linking Willand 
Road to Tiverton Road and the delivery of traffic management measures on Willand Road;  
g) Transfer of land for a primary school together with right of access to the Local Education 
Authority prior to the commencement of the  development on the site, and transfer of funding for 
educa tion facilities in instalments;  
h) The necessary sustainable urban drainage features, and linking pipe work is integrated and 
phased appropriately  in step with development and, where required, temporary measures should 
be taken during construction to protect downstream areas from additional water run -off; and   
i)  Occupation of no more than 600 dwellings prior to the completion of the Cullompton Town Centre 
Relief Road.  76 
  
3.91 The phasing of development will have an important impact on the surrounding area, but it will also impact on 
the economic viability of the development.  T he policy sets out the general approach to phasing , with more detail 
being provide d within the adopted masterplan SPD  February 2016.  Legal obligations and planning conditions will be 
used to control these phasing requirements.  
 
3.92 The provision of transport links and improvements is a key element of the development.  In addition to t he 
need to minimise traffic generation from new development, it will also be necessary to carry out improvements to 
existing infrastructure to ensure that there is sufficient capacity available in order to cope with increased usage.  
 
3.93 The provision of  public transport to connect the site to the rest of the town and the wider area is an important 
part of the strategy to improve the overall sustainability of the urban extension and the town generally.  The North 
West and East Cullompton urban extensions together will generate a significant increase in potential users of public 
transport.  Accordingly, enhancements to the bus service will need to be implemented at an appropriate point in the 
development, before the occupation of no more than 500 dwellings .  
 
3.94 The creation of a through route linking Tiverton Road and Willand Road will serve an important function 
connecting the site to the wider highway network, providing a bus route and serving as a link from south west 
Cullompton to the north.  A throug h route should be completed before the occupation of the 500th dwelling. Devon 
County Council queue length monitoring at junction 28 of the M5 motorway indicates congestion at the AM peak .  No 
more than 600 dwellings should be occupied before the Cullompto n Town Centre Relief Road is completed and open 
to traffic. The provision of the Town Centre Relief Road provides increased capacity at J28 M5.  
 
3.95 The development will generate the need for additional primary school provision over and  above existing 
requirement within the town .  To ensure that reliance on car based trips is reduced, it is important to ensure that this is 
provided within close proximity of new dwellings within the urban extension.  It will therefore be a requirement that 
land is transferr ed to the Local Education Authority with right of access  before the development commences.   
 
3.96 Commercial development will be provided in step with housing to ensure that facilities for older people and 
new jobs are delivered alongside the rising popula tion of the town.  Affordable housing, including extra care housing 
and gypsy and traveller pitches, will be provided at a rate of approximately 25%, in step with the market housing.  
Serviced plots for self -build should not come forward until after the th rough route linking Tiverton Road to Willand 
Road has been provided, as the sale of serviced plots will not generate sufficient funds to pay for road infrastructure 
and it is important not to impede the ability of standard housing development to progress a nd deliver the road at an 
early stage.  
 77 
 Policy CU7 
 
East Cullompton  
 
A site of 160 hectares to the East of Cullompton is allocated for mixed use development subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 1,750 dwellings within the plan period and further development of a t least  850 dwellings post -
2033;  
b) 28% affordable housing to include extra care housing and at least ten  pitches for gypsies and 
travellers, subject to viability;  
c) 5% of housing to be provided as serviced plots for sale to self -builders;  
d) 20,000 squ are metres commercial floorspace within the plan period and a further 12,000 post -
2033, to include a ca re home or retirement complex, a ppropriately scaled retail development and  
other suitable uses such as offices and a hotel or leisure development;  
e) Provision of at least 40 hectares strategic green infrastructure;  
f) Provision of transport improvements to ensure safe and suitable access for all modes, including 
necessary capacity improvements to M5 Junction 28  and pedestrian and cycling links across the 
motorway to the existing town;  
g) Environmental protection and enhancement and  noise mitigation where necessary;  
h) Assessment of land contamination and remediation if necessary;  
i) Land and facilities for community use including a new primary school to me et local needs arising;  
j) Contributions towards expansion of local secondary education facilities to meet needs arising;  
k) Carbon reduction and air quality improvements;  
l) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation;  
m) An agreed phasing s trategy to bring forward development and  infrastructure in step and retain the 
overall viability of development; and  
n) Comprehensive Masterplanning of the development including at least two stages of public 
consultation and adoption of the Masterplan  as a Supplementary Planning Document, before any 
planning application is determined.  
 
3.97 There is currently little development in Cullompton to the east of the motorway.  This large area is 
predominantly agricultural land made up of multiple fields with hedg erows and some mature trees.  While the loss of 
greenfield land is regrettable, Mid Devon is a rural district with insufficient brownfield land to meet the identified 
housing and employment needs of a growing population.  The quality of the agricultural la nd in this area is mixed, 
falling predominantly within Grades 3a and 3b, and there are no alternative sites that could deliver this level of 
development.  There are a number of streams on the site but no significant areas of flood plain.  The Landscape 
Appraisal notes that the site is part of an area of gently undulating land, which is difficult to perceive in the surrounding 
landscape.  Although visible from limited locations within the Blackdown Hills AONB to the east and high ground to the 
north -west of Cullompton, given the low levels of visibility of the site, phased development beginning from the west is 
acceptable.  Nevertheless, development of this site must be carefully planned to ensure that impact on the landscape 
is minimised through appropriate landscaping and ensuring that areas at risk of flooding remain undeveloped.  
 
3.98 Development in Cullompton is severely constrained by the limited capacity at Junction 28 of the motorway, in 
addition to traffic congestion and poor air quality in the town centre.  This development, in combination with the urban 
extension to the northwest of Cullompton, presents an opportunity to resolve town centre traffic problems and provide 
an alternative means of access onto the M5.  The Council has been working closely  with statutory consultees to 
ensure emerging proposals for junction 28 M5 improvements are appropriately designed.   
 
3.99 This development will also provide affordable housing including extra care housing and gypsy and traveller 
pitches, contributing to the needs identified in the Infrastructure Plan, Strategic Housing Market Assessment and the 
Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment.  In addition, provision of around 130 serviced plots for self -builders 78 
 will diversify the choice of housing for poten tial residents, providing a low cost and reasonably straightforward option 
for those who wish to build their own home.  However, the provision of highways infrastructure is fundamental to the 
delivery of this scheme, and the Council will negotiate on the p roportion of affordable housing and self -build plots if 
necessary to ensure the viability of development.  
 
3.100  The Council will consider a range of commercial uses on this site, subject to masterplanning.  The Kingsmill 
area is a well -established employ ment centre and further industrial, warehousing and office development may be 
appropriate where the urban extension adjoins this development and the allocated site at Week Farm.  In addition, a 
development of this size will require small -scale retail devel opment to meet local needs.  The site should also include 
a residential care or nursing home to provide accommodation for the aging population, or another form of 
development for the elderly which generates sufficient jobs.  Self -contained retirement apart ments that include little or 
no onsite care will not be considered to constitute commercial development because they do not provide a significant 
number of jobs, but a retirement ‘village’ or complex may be classed as commercial development if there will b e a 
range of facilities and care services onsite.  The site may also include other leisure or hospitality uses in addition to 
community facilities, a new primary school and various forms of open space.   
 
3.101  A masterplanning exercise will be essential t o consider all the requirements of the development in more detail, 
including the phasing of infrastructure.  The Local Plan sets out a framework for the development, but leaves many 
details for later consideration.  The preparation of a masterplan in consu ltation with stakeholders, including the local 
community, is an important step in achieving a comprehensive development with wider community benefits.  The 
Council will resist ad -hoc development of phases with no reference to the overall vision and develop ment strategy for 
the urban extension.  The developers will be expected to produce a number of further studies and surveys to support 
the masterplan and work in partnership with the Council to achieve its adoption as a Supplementary Planning 
Document.  
 
Policy CU8 
 
East Cullompton Transport Provision  
 
As part of the development of East Cullompton, contributions towards or delivery of the following 
transport infrastructure will be provided by all new development within the site:  
 
a) Capacity improvements at J unction 28 M5 to deliver a strategic highway improvement as 
demonstrated by capacity studies completed to assess the impact of the traffic generated from 
the site ; 
b) Provision of appropriate highway improvements on roads around the development to ensure a ny 
unacceptable traffic impacts are mitigated;  
c) Reopening of Cullompton Railway Station;  
d) Provision of a network of streets linking to the existing highway network, and appropriate 
mitigation to reduce impacts on the existing road network such as Honit on Road;  
e) Provision of bus, pedestrian and cycle routes at appropriate locations throughout the 
development, creating an attractive, permeable network  for non -car modes travelling within, into 
and out of the area;  
f) Safe and attractive cycle and pedestr ian links to and from the town centre  and within the mixed -
use urban extension;  
g) Creation of safe and attractive pedestrian and cycle links between the  development and the 
Kingsmill Industrial Estate;  
h) Implementation of travel plans and other non -tradi tional transport measures to minimise carbon 
footprint and air quality impacts;  
i) Bus service enhancements within, into and out of, the mixed -use urban extension, linking to 
Cullompton town centre;  
j) Bus service enhancements between Cullompton, Exeter, T iverton Parkway and Tiverton.  79 
  
3.102  The provision of appropriate transport infrastructure is a key requirement of the development.  This must 
ensure that there is sufficient long -term capacity for vehicles travelling onto, off and across the motorway.  A well-
functioning road network will also ensure that this is an attractive location for new development, minimising the impact 
on adjoining uses and providing sustainable development that benefits the wider community.  The reopening of 
Cullompton Railway St ation is also a key part of the development strategy for revitalisation of the town, attracting 
inward investment and increasing opportunities for the use of sustainable modes of transport.  East Cullompton, as 
the largest strategic allocation within the p lan, is required to make contributions towards the reopening of the station, 
thereby providing future residents of the site with access to alternative modes of transport.  The Council recognises 
that the high infrastructure costs of this site will not sole ly be funded by the development.  As has been the case on 
other strategic sized sites, the Council will work with its partners and the development industry to secure external 
funding to ensure the delivery of the necessary infrastructure.  
 
3.103  The develo pment should be served by an attractive, convenient and safe network of sustainable transport 
routes, including bus, cycle and pedestrian.  Streets appropriate for frequent bus routes should be provided so that as 
far as possible, all buildings are within 400 metres of bus stops.  These will need to be designed as part of the 
masterplanning process.  It is equally important that there is access to safe and direct cycle and pedestrian routes 
within the urban extension, linking together the dwellings, commerc ial uses and services.  This can be achieved 
through the creation of off -road routes and also by ensuring that streets are designed appropriately for safe walking 
and cycling.  
 
3.104  The provision of green infrastructure as set out in Policy CU9 will prov ide opportunities for off -road cycling and 
walking routes.  These should be integrated into existing and proposed networks as far as possible.  The creation of 
additional public rights of way should be examined.   
 
3.105  Developers will be expected to prep are and implement travel plans for the development as a whole and for its 
constituent parts, to promote non -traditional measures relating to transport that can help minimise the development’s 
carbon footprint and its impacts on air quality.  
 
 
Policy CU9 
 
East Cullompton Environmental Protection and Green Infrastructure  
 
As part of the development of East Cullompton, the following environmental protection and 
enhancement measures will be implemented at the expense of all new development within the site:  
 
a) Measures to protect and enhance trees, hedg erows and other environmental features which 
contribute to the character an d biodiversity, maintaining a wildlife network within the site and 
linking to the surrounding countryside;  
b) An area of 40 hectares for  strategic green infrastructure, laid out and managed with an 
appropriate mix of public parkland, open space, landscaping and local nature reserve;  
c) Areas of equipped and laid out public open spa ce, totalling 0.4 hectares of equipped children’s 
play, 0.1 2 hectares for te enage facilities, 6 hectares amenity green space, 9 hectares of parks, 
sports and recreation grounds, and 1.5 hectares of allotments;  
d) Protection and enhancement where possible of existing Public Rights of Way;  
e) Appropriate screening and landscaping for properties adjacent to the M5;  
f) Appropriate provision of a sewerage system to serve the development and  a strategically 
designed, and phased, Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme to deal with all surface water from the 
development and ar rangements for future maintenance;  80 
 g) A strategic landscaping and tree planting scheme to mitigate landscape impact, protect the 
setting of the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and enhance biodiversity and 
the character of development ; and 
h)  Design solutions which respect the settings of l isted buildings adjoining the site. 
 
3.106  The area proposed as green infrastructure on this site will include land managed for public access and 
biodiversity, and will provide a new recreation facilit y for the town.  There are a number of potentially species rich 
hedgerows and mature trees within the site, and further detailed study of these features will be necessary to confirm 
their potential.  The layout of development should promote the continued u se of wildlife corridors, including 
watercourses, acting to prevent their fragmentation and providing appropriate treatment where such corridors cross 
roads and other linear features.  There is potential for off -road cycle and pedestrian routes to follow t hese features, 
helping maintain their integrity.  
 
3.107  There are various areas of narrow flood plains associated with watercourses running across the site. For 
some of the small watercourses, a flood risk assessment will need to consider the potential of flooding as the current 
extent is unknown. These watercourses do not take up a significant area but the layout of the development will need 
to take flood plains into account.  Areas of floodplain should be retained as part of the strategic green infrastruc ture 
providing wildlife corridors to other areas.  The urbanisation of the area has the potential to increase surface water 
run-off elsewhere, through the loss of permeable surfaces.  The inclusion of a sustainable urban drainage scheme 
approach for the en tire development will ensure that there is no additional run -off from the site as a result of 
development.  Sustainable urban drainage schemes usually involve the provision of ponds, swales and other soft 
areas which can serve as a dual use for public open  space and can be incorporated into wildlife networks.  A strategy 
for dealing with surface water must be prepared as part of the masterplanning of the site to determine the number, 
size and location of the required SUDS features.  The role of landscaping and tree -planting in flood prevention and 
carbon reduction should also be recognised in the development.  
 
3.108  The development of this site will have an impact on the character of the area.  The incorporation of 
appropriate screening,  landscaping and tree  planting will act to mitigate this and should be designed to support high 
quality green infrastructure areas , wildlife corridors and noise attenuation . Two listed buildings are adjacent to the 
northern boundary of the site. The setting of these will need assessment and protection as part of the layout and 
design work associated with the masterplanning exercise, and subsequent planning applications.  
 
 
Policy CU10 
 
East Cullompton Community Facilities  
 
As part of the development of East Cullompton, the foll owing community infrastructure will be 
provided at the expense of all new development within the site:  
 
a)  A serviced site of 2.5ha for a new 630 place primary school, or alternatively 3ha of serviced land 
in two parcels of 1.1ha and 1.9ha appropriately l ocated for the delivery of two new primary 
schools, at no cost to the Local Education Authority ;  
b) A site of 2 hectares for a shopping and community centre, and the provision of a multi -purpose 
community building for youth, children and other community u ses; 
c) Construction costs for a primary school  capacity  of at least 630 places plus additional early years 
provision , including the requisite land to deliver these facilities . The required primary school 
capacity should be delivered  through the provision of either one or two schools ;  
d) Contributions towards the expansion of secondary education facilities in the local area;  
e) Contributions towards the expansion or improvement of local library services  
f) Contribution towards sporting and leisure faciliti es; and  
g) Contributions towards a new recycling centre to serve Cullompton .    81 
  
3.109  The creation of an urban extension requires that residents and workers have access to a range of community 
facilities within easy walking or cycling distance.  This will  discourage trips by car for essential local purposes.  It is 
also important that, as far as is possible, the development of the site does not result in unacceptable pressure on 
existing services and facilities within Cullompton and the surrounding area.  This policy sets out the requirements for 
provision of community facilities within the development site.  
 
3.110  The provision of a new primary school in the urban extension will be required in order to provide local 
educational facilities for the resident  school age children.  The policy requires that the land and construction costs for 
the school are provided to the education authority, within the timing of provision set out in the phasing policy.  The 
development of 2,600 dwellings is expected to give ri se to 390 additional secondary school places and a contribution 
towards the expansion of Cullompton Community College will be required.  The Masterplanning of the development 
will determine the phasing of secondary school contributions.   
 
3.111  The level of community facilities in Cullompton has improved in recent years with the opening of the Hayridge 
Centre (incorporating the library), Cullompton Community Centre and The Walronds manor house and garden.  2,600 
dwellings at East Cullompton will increase t he use of these facilities and generate need for additional locally 
accessible community facilities east of the motorway.  In addition to a neighbourhood centre which provides a range of 
shopping and community facilities, a contribution will be required to wards the expansion or improvement of the town 
library .  The need for additional health care provision could be accommodated within the community facilities.  
 
 
Policy CU11  
 
East Cullompton Carbon Reduction and Air Quality  
 
The development of East Cullompto n will be required to implement a Carbon Reduction and Low 
Emissions Strategy at the expense of all new development in the site.  This will propose measures to 
minimise the overall carbon footprint of the development, making provision for sources of 
decent ralised onsite renewable or low -carbon energy and ensure that impact of the site on air quality 
is acceptable, such as:  
 
a) Renewable and low carbon energy to pro vide a proportion of the site’s energy use;  
b) Measures to ensure that residents, employees an d businesses are encouraged to travel in the 
most sustainable fashion, including travel plans, information, car clubs, lift -shar ing and 
infrastructure for low emission vehicles;  
c) Measures to encourage the sustainable treatment of waste;  
d) Measures to ma nage the impacts of construction;  
e) Offsite tree planting  where sufficient cannot be accommodated onsite;  
f) Energy improvements to existing buildings; and  
g) Other measures to capture or mitigate carbon emissions and air quality   
 impacts from developme nt. 
 
3.112  The construction and use of buildings has major implications for the use of non -renewable resources.  Fifty 
percent of the UK’s carbon emissions come from the construction and operation of the built environment.  As the 
population increases and climate changes, there is a clear need to mitigate and adapt to climate change through 
effective carbon reduction and other methods.  
 
3.113  Policy CU11 ensures that methods of carbon reduction are considered and incorporated into the development 
where app ropriate, such as carbon offsetting, travel plans and design which encourages sustainable ways of living. 
The combination of planning and building control should ensure a sustainable development that minimises carbon 82 
 emissions from both housing and associa ted transport.  Further detail will be required through the masterplanning 
exercise and subsequent planning applications.  
 
3.114  Cullompton was declared an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) in 2006 and an Air Quality Action Plan 
was published in 2010. In  Cullompton, it is important to note that exceedances of pollutants are only along Fore 
Street, near the junction with the High Street and Tiverton Road. In the majority of other areas, pollutant 
concentrations have been monitored to be well below air qual ity objectives. An assessment of the air quality impact of 
the potential development proposed in the Local Plan was undertaken in 2014. Findings from this report indicate that 
the development of a new community at East Cullompton would not have a significa nt effect on the Cullompton 
AQMA. However during the masterplan design of the new community, the potential for air quality effects should be 
considered, in particular, the distance between the residential properties and the M5 should be selected to avoid 
adverse air quality impacts. Highway infrastructure improvements should also accompany the development to ensure 
capacity is increased to limit congestion on the local road network.  
 
 
Policy CU12   
 
East Cullompton Phasing  
 
A phasing strategy will be requi red for the development of East Cullompton to ensure that the 
development and infrastructure come forward in step, minimising the impact of development while 
ensuring that the development remains viable.  The strategy should take account of the following 
requirements, variation of which will have to be carefully justified.  Development shall be subject to 
the following:  
 
a) Provision of affordable housing will be broadly in step with the market housing;  
b) Provision of all serviced self -build plots after st rategic highways infrastructure has  
 been completed;  
c) Provision of commercial development in step with housing, at a rate of at least 1   
 hectare per 500 occupied dwellings;  
d) Provision of strategic green infrastructure broadly in step with developmen t, with public open 
space provided at a rate of at least 1 hectar e per 150 dwellings or phased to deliver a larger area 
of multi -functional public open spa ce at a suitable stage in the development;  
e) Implementation of bus service improvements in step wit h housing development,   
 provided in appropriate instalments;  
f) Capacity improvements at junction 28 M5 to deliver a strategic highway improvement as 
demonstrated by capacity studies completed to assess the impact of the traffic generated from 
the site ; and  
g) Transfer of serviced land together with right of access for primary school (s) at  no cost to the 
Local Education Authority prior to the fi rst occupation of residential development, with necessary 
funding to construct the facil ities being paid to th e Local Education Authority in appropriate 
instalments.  
 
3.115  The phasing of development will have an important impact on the surrounding area, but it will also impact on 
the economic viability of the development.  The policy sets out the general approac h to phasing.  However, this will 
need to be supplemented by a phasing strategy prepared as part of the masterplanning exercise, which may justify 
different phasing arrangements following more detailed analysis of infrastructure needs and the viability of 
development.  Legal obligations and planning conditions will be used to control these phasing requirements.  
 
3.116  The provision of transport links and improvements is a key element of the development.  In addition to the 
need to minimise traffic generati on from new development, it will also be necessary to carry out improvements to 
existing infrastructure to ensure that there is sufficient capacity available in order to cope with increased usage. 83 
 Improved access onto the motorway will be required early in  the development at substantial cost, which may cause 
some delay in the provision of other forms of infrastructure.  Devon County Council’s Strategic Highways Option 
Report (2014) sets out an initial assessment of the various elements phasing of transport infrastructure needed to 
service the site.  A signalisation scheme at junction 28 of the M5 was undertaken in 2015. However this scheme does 
not produce junction capacity to accommodate this development.  The Council has been working closely with statutory 
consultees to ensure emerging proposals  for junction 28 M5 improvements are appropriately designed.    
 
3.117  While East Cullompton developers will be expected to pay for most of the infrastructure associated with this 
development through a Section 106 lega l agreement, the Town Centre Relief Road was allocated in the previous 
Local Plan and was required in response to other developments in and around Cullompton.  With the allocation of 
East Cullompton, a larger area is available within which to locate the re lief road as it is proposed as part of the 
transport mitigation in connection with this allocation.  Dependent on the final route option, the relief road may be either 
east or west of the motorway. Development contributions are proposed via planning obligat ions on East Cullompton 
and NW Cullompton developments . In addition, the Council will seek external sources of funding to help bear the cost 
of highways works that are needed early in the East Cullompton development, as these are critical to the delivery o f 
this strategic site.  
 
3.118  The provision of public transport to connect the site to the rest of the town and the wider area is an important 
part of the strategy to improve the overall sustainability of the urban extension and the town generally.  The No rth 
West and East Cullompton urban extensions together will generate a significant increase in potential users of public 
transport, including rail should the provider decide to reopen a station for the town.  Enhancements to the bus service 
will need to be  implemented at appropriate points in the development, phased according to the delivery of housing.  
 
3.119  The development will generate the need for additional primary school provision, which may be in the form of 
one large school or two smaller primary schools delivered at different stages in the development.  To ensure that a 
suitable location for the school is safeguarded early in the development and its construction phased according to 
arising need, the serviced land should together with right of acce ss be transferred to the Local Education Authority 
before any dwellings are occupied and its construction costs paid in instalments.  
 
3.120  Commercial development will be provided in step with housing to ensure that jobs and facilities for older 
people are  delivered alongside the rising population of the town.  Subject to viability, affordable housing will be 
provided at a rate of approximately 28%, in step with the market housing.  Serviced plots for self -build should not 
come forward until after strategic  highways infrastructure has been provided, as the sale of serviced plots will not 
generate sufficient funds to pay for new roads and it is important not to impede the ability of standard housing 
development to progress and deliver the roads at an early st age.

 Policy CU13  
 
Knowle Lane  
 
A site of 9.8 hectares at Knowle Lane is allocated for residential development subject to the following:  
 
a) 296 dwellings with 35% affordable housing;  
b) Provision of 2.7 hectares of green infrastructure , to include the  retention of land in the floodplain 
as informal amenity open space;  
c) Measures to protect and enhance trees, hedgerows and other environmental features which 
contribute to the character and biodiversity, maintaining a wildlife network within the site and  
linking to the surrounding countryside;  
d) Provision of access route up to and adjoining the existing development to the east of the site and 
the allocation to the south west (Policy CU14);  
e) Provision of at least two points of vehicular access to the si te; 
f) Provision of cycle and pedestrian links within the development and linking  to the wider transport 
network;  
g) Provision of a community building;  
h) Implementation of a Travel Plan and other measures to minimise carbon footprint and air quality 
impa cts; 
i) The necessary sustainable urban drainage features, and linking pipe work  is integrated and 
phased appropriately in step with development ; and  
j)  Provision of M5 access improvements before more than 266 dwellings are  occupied.  
 
3.121  Knowle Lane is  a greenfield site located on the west of Cullompton and directly to the west of a development 
at Knowle Lane known as Kingfisher Reach. The site lies between the southern side of Tiverton Road and Ponsford 
Lane and the northern side of Knowle Lane. A wate r course (Crow Green Stream) runs west to east through the 
central part of the site. The land rises northwards and southwards from the watercourse. The existing boundary is 
made up of trees and hedges.   
 
3.122  Planning permission has been granted for 266 dwellings on a large part of the site, with 35% affordable 
housing.  Its delivery is not dependent upon further M5 access improvements.  Any revised scheme will be subject to 
the same affordable housing criteria as previously applied.  The remaining part o f the site has been confirmed as 
available and is also likely to come forward in the plan period, a total site commitment of 296 dwellings. The 
consented site is considered the primary access route for the remaining part of the site and the adjoining alloc ation at 
Ware Park and Footlands (Policy CU14). Any planning applications will need to ensure suitable vehicular access 
arrangements are provided up to and adjoining the boundary with the adjacent sites in order to avoid the creation of 
any ransom strips.    
 
3.123  The protection and enhancement of existing green infrastructure should be carried out where possible. This 
will entail the protection of existing watercourses, hedgerows and trees and the retention of the area of floodplain as 
an area of informal  amenity open space.  
  85 
 Policy CU14  
 
Ware Park and Footlands  
 
A site of 2.1 hectares at Ware Park and Footlands is allocated for residential development subject to 
the following:  
 
a) 38 dwellings with 28% affordable housing;  
b) No development until the roa d through the North West Cullompton site (Policy CU1) linking 
Tiverton Road to Willa nd Road is fully in operation for public use;  
c) No development until the significant impr ovement works associated with the provision of access 
to the East Cullompton allo cation  have been implemented at M5 Junction 28 ; 
d) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation;  
e) Access from adjoining development at Knowle Lane (Policy CU13); and  
f) Transport assessment and implementation of a travel plan and other non -  
 traditional transport measures to minimise car bon footprint and air quality impacts.  
 
3.124  This site is located to the west of Cullompton adjacent to the allocated site of Knowle Lane. The site is 
comprised of agricultural fields and Crow Green Stream run s along the northern boundary. The site is bounded by 
established hedge boundaries and is relatively flat. Access is only satisfactorily achievable through the Knowle Lane 
site (Policy CU13).  
 
3.125  A geophysical survey undertaken in support of a planning  application in this area identified anomalies within 
the proposed development site that may represent archaeological features, some of which may be indicative of 
industrial activity. In the light of the results of the geophysical survey and the presence o f prehistoric as well as 
18/19th century industrial activity recorded to the east in the adjacent development site, any groundworks associated 
with the development of this area have the potential to expose and destroy archaeological deposits associated wit h 
the known archaeological activity. Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation will be required.  
 
3.126  Knowle Lane, by reason of its width and alignment, is unsuitable to accommodate additional traffic.  
Therefore, access to the site should  instead be taken through the Knowle Lane allocation (Policy CU13) unless the 
road can be widened to the satisfaction of the Highway Authority. Development in this location will impact on 
Cullompton Air Quality Management Area and will require mitigation.   
 
3.127  The site will also impact on the capacity of Junction 28 of the M5 motorway which at present cannot 
accommodate the additional trips generated by this development.  Significant improvement works, including provision 
of a new overbridge, are propos ed to provide additional junction capacity and access to the East Cullompton 
allocation (CU7 - CU12). Once completed, these works should  provide the additional capacity required.  There are also 
issues with the capacity of Tiverton Road, and specifically th e junction with the High Street to accommodate additional 
levels of traffic.  The delivery of a new road through the North West Cullompton site (Policy CU1 -CU6), linking Tiverton 
Road to Willand Road, will allow local traffic to be distributed more widely around the road network.  To avoid an 
unacceptable impact on both the M5 and the local road network in the short term, this site should only come forward 
upon completion of both the M5 improvements and the North West Cullompton through road.

 Policy CU15 
 
Land at Exeter Road  
 
A site of 1.4 hectares at Exeter Road is allocated for residential development, subject to the following:  
 
a) 24 dwellings with 28% affordable housing;  
b) Transport assessment and implementation of a travel plan and other non -tradit ional measures to 
minimise carbon footp rint and air quality impacts; and 
c) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation.  
 
3.128  The site consists of land to the south of the housing at the former Toad Hall, extending between the steep 
hillside to the west and Exeter road to the east. Two dwellings in large grounds make up a portion of the site, together 
with an area of underdeveloped open field between and behind them. A bowling club is located in the middle of and 
surrounded by the site.  Plann ing permission has been granted for 24 dwellings, though potentially the site could 
accommodate more subject to sufficient capacity being available at J28 of the M5.   
 
3.129  The site lies in an area of known prehistoric activity. Any planning application f or development here should be 
supported by an appropriate programme of archaeological work to allow the significance of any below -ground heritage 
assets with an archaeological interest to be understood along with the potential impact of any development upo n 
them.  
 
Policy CU16 
 
Cummings Nursery  
 
A site of 2.78 hectares at Cummings Nursery is allocated for residential development, subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 100 dwellings with 30% affordable housing;  
b) Retention of land in the floodplain as green infrastr ucture and informal  amenity open space;  
c) Appropriate noise mitigation and sound proofing to minimise the impact of the adjacent 
motorway;  
d) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation; and  
e) Transport assessment and implementation of a tr avel plan and other non -traditional measures to   
minimise carbon footprint and air quality impacts.  
 
 
3.130  This site comprises a former horticultural nursery located on the edge of Cullompton on the eastern side of 
the motorway.  The site is covered by d isused greenhouses. The site has reserved matters  permission for 100 
dwellings including 30% affordable housing . Any revised scheme for the site will be required to achieve the same level 
of affordable housing as previously agreed, unless viability evidenc e proves that this is no longer possible. Any 
revised scheme proposing additional housing numbers will be subject to capacity at junction 28 of the M5.  
 
3.131  The site lies between the flood plains of the River Culm (and the M5 corridor) and the Culm Lea/R iverside 
Drive housing estate with vehicular access direct from Honiton Road. The site is relatively level, falling away to the 
flood plain to the west. There is a mature native hedgerow along the western boundary that separates the site from an 
area of op en space that drops down into the flood plain.  
 87 
 3.132  The dwellings are proposed to be erected following the demolition of the existing commercial greenhouse 
buildings on the site, clearance of other infrastructure and remediation of the site. The site ha s fallen into a state of 
dereliction as it has not been actively used for over 10 years. The new vehicular access is proposed from a position at 
the junction between Culm Lea and Riverside Drive.  
 
3.133  The proposed development site lies in a landscape whe re prehistoric and Roman activity is recorded in the 
Historic Environment Record. The northern part of the site has probably been disturbed by the construction of the 
greenhouses, but the southern part still has potential for containing archaeological depo sits. Archaeological 
investigation and mitigation will be required.   
 
Policy CU17 
 
Week Farm  
 
A site of 10.7 hectares is allocated for employment development, subject to the following:  
 
a) 15,000 square metres of employment floorspace within use classes B2-B8; 
b) Provision of a vehicular link from the Kingsmill employment area to Honiton Road;  
c) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation;  
d) Protection and enhancement of the existing Public Right of Way;  
e) Transport assessment and implemen tation of a travel plan and other non -traditional measures to 
minimise carbon footpr int and air quality impacts;  
f) Provision of 2 hectares of green infrastructure to include the retention of land in the floodplain, 
providing a landscape buffer to the west  of the site as an area of informal open space; and  
g)  Capacity improvements at Junction 28 M5 to deliver a strategic highway improvement as 
demonstrated by capacity studies completed to assess the impact of the traffic generated from 
the site.  
 
3.134  The site is located east of the M5 motorway, adjacent to an existing area of significant employment 
development. The site could accommodate approximately 15,000 square metres of employment floor space. This is a 
lower density than would be expected for employ ment uses generally and is comparable to that anticipated on the 
consented adjacent site.  
 
3.135  The site is allocated for B2 -B8 use. However, the Council will consider proposals for alternative employment -
generating uses on their merits.  Development in t his location will increase pressure on the motorway junction. 
Signalisation  works at M5 Junction 28 were undertaken in 2015. Devon County Council queue length monitoring at 
junction 28 of the M5 motorway indicates congestion at the AM peak. The development  will need to mitigate it’s impact 
upon the junction’s capacity through implementation of an improvement scheme, either to the existing junction or in 
the form of more extensive junction improvement works involving a second overbridge required in connectio n with 
development east of Cullompton under policy CU7. A transport assessment to accompany a planning application 
would need to consider the impacts on the local and strategic road network including Junction 28 of the M5.  
 
3.136  This site lies within a la ndscape that has evidence of prehistoric and Roman acti vity recorded in the Devon 
County Historic Environment Record. To the west, recent archaeological work has demonstrated the presence of 
prehistoric and Roman settlement in and around Cullompton. There is potential for the site to contain archaeological 
deposits associated with the known prehistoric and Roman activity in the vicinity, so archaeological investigation and 
appropriate mitigation will be required.  
 
3.137  In order to improve accessibility th e site will enable the creation of an additional point of access linking the site 
itself, along with the wider Kingsmill employment area, to Honiton Road. This is seen as an important advantage of the 
development of the site that will help to relieve press ure on the existing access to the area.  88 
  
3.138  The site is bounded to the west by the River Ken and its associated floodplain. Development of the area of 
floodplain should be avoided and retained as green infrastructure, which may be designed into the deve lopment as an 
informal recreational area for those working at the site.    
 
Policy CU18 
 
Venn Farm  
 
A site of 4.4 hectares is allocated for employment development, subject to the following:  
 
a) 12,000 sqm of employment floorspace within use classes B1 -B8; 
b) Suitable vehicular access which directs traffic to and from the site via Saunders Way;  
c) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation;  
d) Transport assessment and implementation of a travel plan and other non -traditional measures to 
minimise  carbon footprint and air quality impacts;  
e) Measures to protect and enhance trees, hedgerows and other environmental features which 
contribute to the character and biodiversity, maintaining a wildlife network within the site and 
linking to the surroundin g countryside;  
f) Retention of areas within the floodplain as green infrastructure; and  
g)  Capacity improvements at junction 28 M5 to deliver a strategic highway improvement as 
demonstrated by capacity studies completed to assess the impact of the traffic  generated from 
the site.  
 
3.139  Planning permission was granted in March 2015 f or 12,000 sq m of B1, B2 and B8 floorspace. A reserved 
matters planning application has been submitted for part of the site.  The site is located adjacent to the existing 
Kingsm ill Industrial Estate on the east side of the M5 Motorway. The site is well contained by natural features 
comprising existing development to the south, the River Culm to the west and an existing track and road to the north 
and south east. The land to the n orth and east is low lying agricultural land and to the south is the remainder of the 
industrial estate. The western boundary is defined by the River Culm which is separated from the M5 motorway by low 
lying pasture which is predominantly within the river flood plain.  
 
3.140  Signalisation  works to Junction 28 were undertaken in 2015.  Highways England  has removed a holding 
direction that previously prevented the development from taking place. Devon County Council queue length monitoring 
at junction 28 of th e M5 motorway indicates congestion at the AM peak. The development will need to mitigate it’s 
impact upon the junction’s capacity through implementation of an improvement scheme, either to the existing junction 
or in the form of more extensive junction imp rovement works involving a second overbridge required in connection 
with development east of Cullompton under policy CU7. Planning permission already granted does not include this 
requirement however it would apply to any new full or outline applications.   Access is achievable via Saunders Way, 
avoiding increased use of Kingsmill Road.   
 
3.141  This site lies in an area of archaeological potential and within a floodplain of the River Culm. Ground 
disturbance in this area may expose archaeological and palaeo environmental deposits, so archaeological 
investigation and appropriate mitigation will be required. Development should provide a habitat buffer in the floodplain 
and avoid any development within the floodplain unless the sequential test required by nation al policy has been met.

 Policy CU19 
 
Town Centre Relief Road  
 
A relief road, providing traffic relief to the town centre, will be provided subject to the following:  
 
a) Public consultation exercise before the route of the road is determined;  
b) Provisi on of replacement open space and sporting facilities elsewhere in Cullompton if these are 
affected;  
c) Provision of a shared use foot and cycleway;  
d) Measures to protect and enhance trees, hedgerows and other  environmental features which 
contribute to the  character and biodiversity, maintaining a wildlife network on the affected 
alignment and linking to the surrounding countryside.  Appropriate noise measures to mitigate 
the effects from the relief road including the provision of landscaping and  
e)  Archae ological investigation and appropriate mitigation.  
 
3.142  The Town Centre Relief Road, previously known as the Eastern Relief Road, is an integral part of the 
development strategy for Cullompton, designed to relieve traffic through the town centre in conju nction with a road 
through the North West urban extension to link Tiverton Road to Willand Road.  The evidence in 2010 concluded that 
a new road to the east of the town centre is essential if the objectives of traffic relief, air quality improvement and wi th 
it town centre enhancement, are to be achieved.  It is also important since the town centre acts as a strategic relief 
route for the M5 during closures resulting in significant congestion.  Careful consideration will need to be taken in 
finalising the ro ute, which could be located either side of the motorway.  The aim will be to cause minimum impact on 
the CCA fields and acceptability in terms of flood risk and flood flows.   Devon County Council is producing a Flood 
Risk Assessment and will consult on the  options for the exact route of the road should the final route impact on the 
loss of sports or open space, replacement provision will need to be made available in a suitable location.  At the 
planning application stage, safety measures such as the closure of the relief road via an automated system prior to its 
flooding may need to be considered. The Council has been working closely with statutory consultees to ensure 
emerging proposals for junction 28 M5 improvements are appropriately designed.  
 
3.143  Cullo mpton is facing the same traffic issues now as it was when the previous Local Plan was being prepared.  
Additional housing development has now taken place at Knowle Lane and Tiverton Road, contributing to the delivered  
Junction 28 improvements and funding for the Town Centre Relief Road, but work on the road has not yet 
commenced.   The delivery of the road depends upon the delivery of the North West and East urban extensions and 
development elsewhere.  The road is likely to be funded by either developer con tributions or Community Infrastructure 
Levy as well as external sources of funding sought by the Council.  
 
3.143a  If the final route of the road is located on the western side of the motorway, there is the potential for impact on 
the settings of nearby li sted buildings and the Cullompton conservation area. The extent of any impact will depend on 
the road’s design and elevation above the flood plain, and therefore the final scheme will need to incorporate design 
solutions which mitigate such impacts . Any lo ss of floodplain at this location should be mitigated by the creation of 
additional/compensatory floodplain which should secure wider environmental and sustainability benefits including the 
provision of appropriate ecological and biodiversity enhancements.  The site also lies in an area known to have been 
occupied since at least the Roman era, the area potentially containing archaeological deposits from this period 
onwards. Archaeological investigation and mitigation will therefore be required.

Cullompton Infrastructure  
 
The Council will promote the reopening of the Cullompton Railway Station.  A site for a new railway 
station north of Station Road is allocated for this purpose.  The Council will use developer funding via 
planning obligatio ns and the Community Infrastructure Levy where appropriate, seek external sources 
of funding and work with partners to deliver the following infrastructure for Cullompton:  
 
a)  Provision of a Town Centre Relief Road and implementation of other measures in the Cullompton 
Air Quality Action Plan;  
b)  Mitigation to reduce traffic impacts on the Trunk and Local Road network in association with the 
East Cullompton Urban Extension and other Cullompton allocations;  
c)  Town centre regeneration and enhancement;  
d) Extra care housing provision;  
e)  Expansion of library facilities;  
f)  Primary and secondary education facilities;  
g) Public open space and green infrastructure;  
h)  Bus service enhancements;  
i)  Provision of railway and bus interchange;  
j)  Expansion of e mergency fire and rescue services;  
k)  Prov ision of healthcare facilities;  
l)  Community facilities including sports and leisure facilities  
m)  Provision of works to reduce flood risk ; and  
n)    Provision of a replacement recycling centre facility .  
 
3.144 Strategic Local Plan sites will be required to pay for specific items of infrastructure that are necessary to make 
the development acceptable via planning obligations .  Other development (if eligible) will be charged the Community 
Infrastructure Levy (CI L) at a rate per square metre.   CIL funds will be spent according to a prescribed list of 
infrastructure projects or types of infrastructure.  
 
3.145  The Council’s strategic infrastructure policy is set out earlier in the Local Plan under Policy S8, but t here are 
infrastructure requirements specific to Cullompton that are listed under Policy CU20.  The Council will use CIL, 
planning obligations for strategic sites and other sources of funding to deliver the infrastructure listed wherever 
possible.  Where a nother organisation is responsible for delivering the infrastructure required as a result of new 
development, the Council will work in partnership with the relevant bodies to ensure that infrastructure needs 
associated with development are addressed approp riately.    
 
3.146  The Local Transport Plan includes a long -term aspiration to reopen Cullompton Railway Station.  The Local 
Plan allocates land north of Station Road as a possible site for the new station, including land for a car park.  There is 
also an aspiration to provide a bus interchange for the town which could be provided in the same location.  The 
Council will work with Devon County Council and other partners to achieve this objective.  91 
 Policy CU21 
 
Land at Colebrook       
 
A site of 4.8 hectares at Colebrook is allocated  for residential development , subject to the following:  
 
a) 100 dwellings with 28% affordable housing;   
b) Provision of two points of access from Siskin Chase;  
c) Provision of 1.1 hectares of green infrastructure, to include the r etention of land in the floodplain 
as informal amenity open space and for Sustainable Urban Drainage provision;  
d) Measures to protect and enhance trees, hedgerows and other  environmental features which 
contribute to t he character and biodiversity, m aintai ning a wildlife network within the site and 
linking to the surrounding countryside;  
e) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation; and  
f) Transport assessment and implementation of travel plans and other measures to minimise carbon 
footprint a nd air quality impacts.   
 
3.147  The site is currently used for agricultural land and is adjacent to the Cullompton settlement limit. Colebrook 
Lane bisects the site, and the field boundaries and edging of the site are mainly compri sed of hedgerows and tree s. 
The site is fairly flat from Colebrook Lane to the south, but gently slopes towards the west, with land rising to the north.  
 
3.149  Development in this location has the potential to place pressure on  the capacity of both the strategic and local 
road ne twork. Any application for development must undertake an assessment of the impact of the proposal on both 
the capacity of the local road network and Junction 28 of the M5 and permission will only be granted where there are 
no significant adverse impacts.  The site is expected to contribute to the provision of off -site highways infrastructure.  
The development would also be expected to provide two poin ts of access from Siskin Chase.  
 
3.150  There is an area of floodplain on the southern edge of the site and it is proposed that this is incorporated into 
the 1.1 hectares of Green Infrastructure. Measures will also be necessary to protect existing environmental features 
including trees, hedgerows and the stream.  
 
3.151  Archaeological investigations in the vicinity  have demonstrated the presence of extensive and significant 
prehistoric and Romano -British sites. The Historic Environmental Record suggests areas of a prehistoric funerary 
monument occupying the valley floor. An archaeological assessment will need to be undertaken, the results of which 
should be taken into account during the detailed planning of the site to ensure protection where necessary.

3.154  Two sites in Crediton are expected to deliver commercial floorspace during the plan period. The amount of 
floorspace to be provided by commercial development depends on the use.  For instance, office development on 
multiple floors  provides a greater amount of floorspace per hectare than a single -storey warehouse, and some 
commercial uses require more land for parking than others.  Floorspace assumptions for different uses are set out in 
the methodology for Strategic Commercial Land  Availability Assessment (SCLAA), but the Council recognises that this 
is only a starting point and a higher or lower density of development may be justified depending on the nature of the 
proposal that comes forward.

Wellparks  
 
A site of 22.9 hectares at Wellparks, A377 is allo cated for residential and commercial development 
subject to the following:  
 
a) 185 dwellings with 28% affordable housing on 7.9 hectares;  
b) 2,220 square metres of commercial floorspace in the south east part of the site;  
c) 15 hectares of Green Infrastruc ture o n the upper slopes of the site;  
d) Layout, design and landscaping that reflects the sloping, visible nature of the site, locally 
distinctive design and the need to protect the setting of Downes Historic Park and Garden and 
respect  the character and s etting of the listed buildings at Wellparks and Downes House ; and  
e) Improved pedestrian and cycle access to the town  centre and facilities to the south of the A377  
 
3.155  This site is to the south east of Crediton and is adjacent to the new Crediton Link Road to the east and 
Crediton Conservation Area to the west.  This prominent wooded hillside gives character and an attractive skyline to 
the eastern half of the town. The development of the site, even though it is on the lower southern edge of the hillsid e, 
would have an impact on the rural views to the south of the town, requiring careful design and mitigation.  
 
3.156  Planning permission has been granted for 185 dwellings, including 27.5% affordable housing.  The policy 
provides the criteria to be applie d as a starting point, should any revised scheme be submitted.    
 
3.157  Due to the constraints of the site in respect of the Local Historic Park and Garden, adjoining listed buildings 
and a number of large trees that are interspersed in the development, a  lower than usual density is assumed. In 
respect of the impact on the landscape, this will require careful treatment.  
 
3.158  A small watercourse runs along the boundary of the site.  A flood risk assessment will need to consider the 
potential for flooding .  An onsite Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme will require implementation to negate any 
increase in flood risk and ensure that there is no additional run -off from the site as a result of development.  
Sustainable drainage is a standard requirement under P olicy DM1.

 Policy CRE2  
 
Red Hill Cross, Exhibition Road  
 
A site of 3.1 hectares at Red Hill Cross is allocated for residential development subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 135 dwellings with 28% affordable housing;  
b) Layout, design and landscaping that re flect the local distinctiveness, the visibility of the site and 
its sloping nature;  
c) Improved access to the town centre for pedestrians and cyclists; and 
d) Land for a 0.4 hectare extension to Crediton cemetery.  
 
3.159  The site previously had outline pla nning permission  for 135 dwellings with 22% affordable housing, however 
the permission lapsed in 2016. It is  understood that delivery of the site is likely to take place after the Pedlerspool 
allocation has  received permission with options for joint access  being considered.  
 
3.160  The site is in a prominent position, which is visible from histo ric Shobrooke Park to the east. Detailed design 
and development which respect local distinctiveness, including a generous  landscape margin on the east facing side 
of the site will mitigate any potential impact.  
 
3.161  The development will also be expected to provide improved access to the town centre for  pedestrians and 
cyclists with scope for improvements along Exhibition Road. The  development will need to contribute  towards these 
and other improvements to the local  pedestrian and cycle way network. A comprehensive approach to pedestrian and 
cycle route  improvements should be taken in relation to allocations CRE2 Red Hill Cross, CRE5  Pedlerspool and 
CRE6 Sports Fields  all on Exhibition Road. In addition, there is an identified need for an extension to Crediton 
cemetery which can be secured through the development of this site.  
 
Policy CRE3  
 
Cromwells Meadow  
 
A site of 1.3 hectares at Cromwells Meadow is allocated for residential development subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 35 dwellings with 28% affordable housing; and  
b) Archaeological investigations and appropriate mitigation measures.  
 
3.162  The site lies to the east of Crediton with residential development to the west  and agricultural land to the east 
of the site.  Vehicular access into the site can be achieved from Willow Walk. Appropriate landscaping will be required 
along the eastern boundary given the potential visibility of the site from historic Shobrooke Park.  
 
3.163  There is an area of floodplain on the eastern boundary of the site. The layout of the development will need to 
take this into account. The urbanisation of the area would have the potential to increase surface water run -off 
elsewhere, through the loss  of permeable surfaces. Sustainable drainage is a standard requirement for new 
development under Policy DM1.  The site also lies in an area of archaeological potential on the western edge of the 
floodplain.  Archaeological investigation and appropriate mit igation will be required.  95 
 Policy CRE4  
 
Woods Group, Exeter Road  
 
A site of 0.17 hectares at Woods Group is allocated for residential development subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 8 dwellings;  
b) Mitigation for potential onsite air quality issues with specific  design to  prevent worsening of air 
quality on Exeter Ro ad and to avoid potential air quality issues for occupants; and  
c) Design which respects the character and setting of adjoining listed buildings and the 
Conservation Area.  
 
3.164  This is a small bro wnfield site within the built up area of Crediton and is suitable for redevelopment. It is 
located towards the south of Crediton and is currently occupied by a number of structures and scrap.   
 
3.165  The design of the site is important as the site lies in  part within the Conservation Area and adjoins listed 
buildings , whilst the site contains a number of unlisted buildings of strong  traditional local character. The retention and 
conversion of these buildings would enhance the character of the conservation area. The loss of these buildings would 
be considered unacceptable without special justification.   
 
 
Policy CRE5  
 
Pedlerspool, Exhibition Road  
 
A site of 21 hectares at Pedlerspool, Crediton, is allocated for residential development subject to the 
followin g: 
 
a) 200 dwellings with 28% affordable housing including at least five pitches for gypsies and 
travellers;  
b) A serviced site of 1.1 hectares for a new primary school  with early years provision and children’s 
centre service delivery base ;  
c) A suitable site for the relocation of Crediton Rugby Club;  
d) A phasing strategy which ensures that sites for the sports pitches, affordable housing and gypsy 
and traveller pitches are delivered broadly in step with the housing development, and the school 
is transfer red to the local education authority at a timetable agreed with Devon County Council  
e) Layout, design and landscaping, including planting on the riverside that reflects the local 
distinctiveness and its sloping nature;  
f) The protection of the setting of Creedy Historic Park and Garden and the wider area, including the 
upper slopes to south and west for Green Infrastructure and landscaping;  
g) Facilitation of access to local bus routes via sustainable travel modes  including possible 
extension of service;  
h) Provision of suitable access arrangements from th e A3072 and appropriate highway 
improvements along Stonewall Lane and Old Tiverton Road;  
i)  Improved access to the town centre for pedestrians and cyclists;  
j) Protection and enhancement of trees subject to Tree Preservation Orders within and adjoining the 
site; and  
k) An archaeological investigation and mitigation scheme.  
 
3.166  This site falls within Sandford Parish, but will provide for the strategic growth of Crediton as it adjoins the 
settlement bound ary.  This site forms a large agricultural holding to the north east of Crediton and is bisected by a 96 
 road running roughly through the middle. The site is bounded on three sides by country roads to the east, south and 
west.  
 
3.167  Devon County Council has  identified that there is a need for a new primary school in Crediton.  Both existing 
schools are on constrained sites and are being expanded to their maximum  potential. This site is a suitable location 
for a new school, given that the north east part of t he town is the focus of growth and provides the opportunity to 
balance the distribution of schools in Crediton, thereby reducing travel distances for future and existing residents of 
this part of the town. Given that the need for the school arises from the  wider growth of Crediton, the Pedlerspool 
allocation will not be expected to meet the full costs of providing the facility. The actual cost to the development and 
the timing of the transfer will be subject to negotiation between the landowner/developer, M id Devon District Council 
and Devon County Council as Local Education Authority. The school should be provided within the site in lieu of an 
employment use which was included in a previous Local Plan policy. Commercial uses would still be considered on 
this site in addition to the school should a proposal demonstrate a suitable relationship between housing, commercial 
and community uses.  
 
3.168  This site will provide an alternative location and improved facilities for the Crediton Rugby Club, allowing for 
housing development on the site of existing sports field s to come forward (Policy CRE6).  
 
3.169  The character of the local registered Historic Parkland at Creedy Park needs to be protected and the tree 
boundary protected and softened with native species. A  buffer of trees should be provided around and within this site. 
Planting along the Park boundary should reflect the historic planting to extend and soften the transition into Green 
Infrastructure proposed on the floodplain area to the east.  
 
3.170  Highwa y mitigation measures will need to be provided to offset the impact of developing the site.  In particular 
there is the potential for cumulative highway impacts on the local road network arising from the development of this 
site and the nearby Stonewall La ne allocation.  A Transport Assessment will need to be provided, which 
comprehensively assesses the transport issues related to development of the site, taking into account the potential 
cumulative impact of nearby allocations.  A number of highway improve ments are likely to be needed as a result.  In 
particular there will need to be a realignment of the carriageways of Old Tiverton Road and the A3072 most likely 
requiring a roundabout design.  Improvements will also be required at the junctions of Old Tive rton Road/Stonewall 
Lane and Pounds Hill/Stonewall Lane.  Both Stonewall Lane and Old Tiverton Road are tree -lined in part, and 
therefore cannot be widened where they adjoin the site boundary without significant loss in tree cover.  Instead, 
improvements t o passing places along both Stonewall Lane and Old Tiverton Road should be provided . The 
development will also be required to provide improved access to the town centre for pedestrians and cyclists with 
scope for improvements along Exhibition Road. The dev elopment will need to contribute towards these and other 
improvements to the local pedestrian and cycle way network. A comprehensive approach to pedestrian and cycle 
route improvements should be taken in relation to allocations CRE2 Red Hill Cross, CRE5 Pe dlerspool and CRE6 
Sports Fields all on Exhibition Road.  
 
3.171  The River Creedy flows to the east of the site. Hydrological and hydraulic assessment should be undertaken 
to verify the flood extent. The results of the modelling will inform the location of different uses on the site, directing 
residential development to areas of lowest flood risk. This will need to be set out in a Flood Risk Assessment and 
accompanying drainage strategy.  
 
3.172  The site lies within an area of archaeological potential. Inves tigation and potential mitigation may be needed.  
 97 
 Policy CRE6  
 
Sports fields, Exhibition Road  
 
A site of 5.5 hectares at the sports fields, north and south of Exhibition Road, is allocated for 
residential development, subject to the following:  
 
a) 120 dw ellings with 28% affordable housing;  
b) Relocation of the rugby club and associated pitches to a suitable alternative site before 
development is commenced;  
c) Provision of a Transport Assessment to assess the need for a right turn lane  into the northern  
part of the site;  
d)  Improved access to the town centre for pedestrians and cyclists; and  
e) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation.  
 
3.173  The site comprises the club house, main pitch and a number of training pitches currently used by C rediton 
Rugby Club.  A site for the relocation of the club has been identified within the Pedlerspool site (Policy CRE5), freeing 
up this site for residential development.  However, should the Pedlerspool site not come forward, another suitable 
alternative  site for the rugby club and training pitches will need to be found before thi s allocation can be developed. 
The replacement sports facilities should result in no net loss in provision.  
 
3.174  The part of the site to the south of Exhibition Road is flat w ith good access from the A3072, whilst the area to 
the north is steep adjoining the road, which has implications for design, layout and access. A right turn lane may be 
required in order to access the northern part of the site, the need for which should be  identified by a Transport 
Assessment to be submitted by the applicant.  The provision of secondary points of access will be necessary for both 
parts of the allocation, though it is acknowledged that achieving this may result in the loss of some of the tre es which 
currently adjoin the north side of Exhibition Road.  
 
3.174a  The development will also be required to provide improved access to the town centre for pedestrians and 
cyclists with scope for improvements along Exhibition Road. The development will n eed to contribute towards these 
and other improvements to the local pedestrian and cycle way network. A comprehensive approach to pedestrian and 
cycle route improvements should be taken in relation to allocations CRE2 Red Hill Cross, CRE5 Pedlerspool and 
CRE6 Sports Fields all on Exhibition Road.  
 
3.175  The site lies within an area of archaeological potential. Investigation and potential mitigation may be needed.

 Policy CRE7  
 
Stonewall Lane  
 
A site of 3.2 hectares at Stonewall Lane is allocated for res idential development subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 50 dwellings with 28% affordable housing;  
b) Relocation of playing fields to a suitable alternative site before development is commenced;  
c) Layout, design and landscaping which reflects  the elevated, visi ble nature of the site;  
d) Diversion of Stonewall Lane through the site t o Jockey Hill and widening of Stonewall Lane along 
its frontage and replacement of boundary landscape;  
e) Provision of pedestrian crossing facility from the site to existing footpath network on Jockey Hill; 
and 
f) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation.  
 
3.176  The site is located on the north side of Crediton, within the settlement limit. It is currently used as playing 
fields owned by the Queen Elizabeth Academy Trust , which runs the school in Crediton.  The site comprises two 
football pitches which the school considers too remote for effective daily use.  The school has stated an intention to 
use the proceeds from the sale of the site to substantially reinvest in thei r Barnfield campus which will result in an 
increase in playing field capacity at that site.  The redevelopment of playing fields needs to be closely controlled to 
ensure there is no net loss in playing provision.  As a result the delivery of adequate alter native sports provision would 
need to be secured before development is commenced on the existing sports fields.  Any new provision would need to 
match or exceed the sports land being lost, whether in terms of quantity, quality or both.  
 
3.177  The site is e levated and visually prominent, offering wide views to the south.  Any scheme for the 
redevelopment of the site would need to ensure adequate landscaping is provided to mitigate any landscape or visual 
impacts , as well as any heritage impacts associated wi th the adjoining Creedy Park. High quality design will be 
required in accordance with Policy DM1.  There is the potential for cumulative highway impacts on the local road 
network arising from the development of this site and the nearby Pedlerspool allocati on. A Transport Assessment will 
need to be provided, which comprehensively assesses the transport issues related to development of the site, taking 
into account the potential cumulative impact of nearby allocations.  Stonewall Lane, which runs along the no rthern 
boundary of the site is narrow, whilst the junction where it meets Jockey Hill is sub -standard and has limited visibility, 
being located close to the crest of the hill.  Stonewall Lane would need to be diverted through the site enabling 
construction  of a new junction with Jockey Hill, to the south of the existing junction and providing suitable visibility 
splays.  Stonewall Lane will need to be widened to provide sufficient width for two vehicles along the site frontage.  
Any loss of Devon Bank arisi ng from the highway realignment will need to be replaced.  The site also lies within an 
area of archaeological potential and investigation and potential mitigation may be needed.  99

Land at Barn Park  
 
A site of 1.64 hectares at Barn Park is all ocated for residential development subject to the following:  
 
a) 20 dwellings with 28% affordable housing; and  
b) Vehicular access from Barn Park.  
 
3.178  The site is located on the south of Crediton with residential development along the northern boundarie s. The 
site is located relatively close to the town centre.  
 
3.179  Access to the site will be through Barn Park as access is limited and the Highway Authority has advised that 
this is the maximum number of houses suitable for access through the existing h ousing estate.

Land at Alexandra Close  
 
A site of 0.63 hectares at Alexandra Close is allocated for residential development subject to the

Land south of A377  
 
A site of 2.6 hectares south of the A377 in Crediton is allocated for commercial development subject 
to the following:  
 
a) 7,600 square metres of B1, B2 or B8 floorsp ace or other suitable commercial uses.  
 
3.181  This site adjoins the existing Tesco store and a restaurant, with access from the A377 on the east side of the 
town.  The site was part of a larger allocation in a previous Local Plan, which subsequently had ou tline planning 
permission for mixed use development.  This remaining part of the site is still available for commercial use, which may 
include B1 -B8 uses such as offices, light industry or storage and distribution, or alternatively a suitable ‘sui generis’  
use if appropriate.  
 
3.182  A better understanding of the flows of the Rivers Yeo and Creedy, undertaken by the Environment Agency, 
has indicated that this area is at greater risk of flooding than indicated at the time of the original permissions which 
covered the wider Tesco site. They have indicated that some of the site may actually lie within an area of floodplain 
that would be highly functional in times of severe flood, and subsequently development previously considered 
acceptable could now exacerbate flood risk. A Flood Risk Assessment will therefore need to be submitted with any 
application on the site which will need to incorporate both a comprehensive level survey of the site’s current 
arrangement, and additional modelling taking into account curren t levels. The purpose of such will be to determine the 100 
 risks so that fully informed decisions regarding the suitability, or otherwise, of the currently undeveloped plots that 
benefit from outline permission can be made. The layout, site and floor levels of  any development will be heavily 
dictated by the flood risks. Appropriate landscaping and sensitive design and materials will be required given the 
position of the site to the south of the historic Downes park and garden and the listed complex at Wellparks . 
 
 
Policy CRE11  
 
Crediton Infrastructure  
 
The Council will use the Community Infrastructure Levy and planning obligations where appropriate, 
seek external sources of funding and work with partners to deliver the following infrastructure for 
Crediton:  
 
a)  Enhanced pedestrian and cycle facilities to serve development;  
b) Bus service enhancements;  
c)  Air quality improvements;  
d)  Expansion and improvement of primary and secondary education facilities;  
e)  Public open space and green infrastructure;  
f)  Expansion of emergency fire and rescue services;  
g)  Library reconfiguration to provide Devon Centre;  
h)  Extra care housing;  
i)  Community facilities including provision for children/youth;  
j) Potential highway improvements;  and 
k)  Provision of works to r educe flood risk.  
 
3.183  Strategic Local Plan sites will be required to pay for specific items of infrastructure that are necessary to make 
the development acceptable.  Other development (if eligible) will be charged the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)  
at a rate per square metre.   CIL funds will be spent according to a prescribed list of infrastructure projects or types of 
infrastructure.  
 
3.184  The Council’s strategic infrastructure policy is set out earlier in the Local Plan under Policy S8, but the re are 
infrastructure requirements specific to Crediton that are listed under Policy CRE11.  The Council will use CIL, planning 
obligations for strategic sites and other sources of funding to deliver the infrastructure listed wherever possible.  
Where anot her organisation is responsible for delivering the infrastructure required as a result of new development, 
the Council will work in partnership with the relevant bodies to ensure that infrastructure needs associated with 
development are addressed appropria tely.

Policy J27  
 
Land at Junction 27 of the M5 Motorway  
 
A site of approximately 71 hectares adjoining the south bound carriageway of the M5 motorway, 
adjacent to junction 27 is identified for major development. The land, which lies  to the south of the 
A38, is allocated for the provision of a major high quality regional tourism, leisure and retail attraction 
supported by ancillary roadside services and supporting infrastructure including a pedestrian bridge 
across the M5 motorway lin king the site to Tiverton Parkway railway station.  
 
The site provides a prime location for delivery of a major leisure destination themed around 
agriculture and the agri -economy; the regional environment and tourism; outdoor land and water -
based adventure activities and outlet -retailing. The site provides a major opportunity to deliver a 
unique leisure destination at the gateway to Devon and Cornwall which should be realised as a single 
cohesive and comprehensively masterplanned visitor attraction.  
 
The all ocation makes provision for the following elements:  
 
·  Travel Hub (7ha) – Motorway/roadside services; electric car hub; hotel.  
·  Agronomy Visitor Centre (9ha) – exhibition space and hall, gallery; research and education space; 
regional visitor centre and  hotel.  The Agronomy centre will include  up to 1,000 square metres of 
ancillary retail.  
·  Outdoor Adventure Zone (6ha) – Surf lake/lagoon; beach; high ropes adventure area.  
·  Outlet Shopping Village (6ha) - Designer outlet shopping ce ntre retailing cont rolled goods 
comprising discontinued/end -of-range lines, seconds and surplus/sample  stock.  The Outlet 
Shopping Village to include up to 14,000 square metres of controlled comparison goods and up to 
2,000 square metres of A3 uses.  
 
The development is subje ct to the following:  
 
a) Any planning application which includes a ‘designer outlet shopping centre’ should be  
accompanie d by a full Retail and Leisure Impact Assessment  to ensure that any potential adverse 
impacts identified are addressed and mitigated ; 
b)  Provision of supporting access roads, parking and infrastructure/landscaping (43ha);  
c)  Provision of transport improvements to ensure safe and suitable access for all modes, including 
necessary capacity improvements to M5 Junction 27 and pedestrian and  cycling link across the 
motorway to Tiverton Parkway Railway Station ;  
d)  Environmental protection and enhancement including noise mitigation;  
e)  A comprehensive phasing programme to ensure the tourist and leisure provisions are  
 delivered at the same time as the retail and service elements of the development; and  
    
Development of the site should be brought forward in accordance with the terms of a detailed 
development brief, comprehensive masterplanning including at least two  stages of public 
consult ation and adoption of the Masterplan as a Supplementary  Planning Document before any 
planning application for any part of the site is  determined.  
 
3.184a  A site of 71 hectares is allocated to the south and east of Junction 27 of the M5 motorway.  The alloc ation 
identifies the land for tourism, leisure and retail development. The proposal seeks to significantly increase the tourism 
and leisure offer available in Mid Devon as identified in the Mid Devon Tourism Study 2014. The 2014 study identified 
that the M 5 and the mainline railway provides an opportunity to develop Mid Devon`s tourism infrastructure around 102 
 these key links. To encourage a greater proportion of people to break their journey in the area, for instance to visit a 
local attraction, market or ret ail facilities or to stay. It identifies that this opportunity builds on the District’s location at 
the gateway location to Exmoor and the North Devon Coast; and on the route to Dartmoor, the South Devon Coast 
and Cornwall from much of the UK. Given the vo lume of tourists who pass through Mid Devon on route to other 
destinations, such as North and South Devon and Cornwall, the study identified that more could be done to encourage 
these tourists to stop en -route and increase the length of time (and money) to urists spend in Mid Devon.  
 
3.184b  The study identified six potential strands to assist the growth of tourism in Mid Devon offering opportunities for 
visitors to stop and stay when travelling through to destinations further south and west. The allocation a t J27 makes 
provision to directly address three of the recommended strategies by setting a policy which can provide a major 
tourist, leisure and retail facility which caters for all age groups and which encourages visitors passing through to stop 
and spend  time in Mid Devon.  
 
3.184c  The allocation includes associated outlet/discounted retail floorspace to meet a regional comparison need and 
deliver the tourist and leisure elements of the allocation. Existing town centres will be safeguarded through planning  
controls.  There is a clear synergy between the Designer Outlet Village proposal and the tourism and leisure aspects 
of the proposed allocation.  It is not considered viable to disaggregate this proposed allocation given the nature an d 
interdependency of the uses. Therefore it needs to be in a location which can accommodate this scale of development 
and has appropriate links to the strategic highway and rail networks.  A number of sites were considered both within 
and outside of Mid Devon.  These sites incl uded Cullompton, Tiverton, Taunton and Exeter. None could provide the 
site area required to accommodate the proposal as a single development nor could they provide the accessibility of 
the allocation site.  The J27 site provides sufficient land to accommod ate the proposal as a whole, adjacent to the 
strategic road and rail network and one which is served by local bus services.  The site lies adjacent to the main road 
and rail tourist routes into the West Country and is also ideally situated to serve the wid er catchment area.  The site 
already has planning permission for a roadside service area. The allocation site lies within easy reach of Exeter 
Airport and on route to the southwest European ferry terminal. The site is adjacent to one of the larger M5 motor way 
junctions south of Bristol which can readily be improved to accommodate the proposal.  
 
3.184d  The proposals for a major facility of this nature needs to be considered carefully in terms of its impacts and 
the policy makes provision for detailed transpo rt assessments, environmental protection and green infrastructure, 
energy conservation, provision of improved public transport, pollution and drainage considerations, phasing and 
importantly master planning with full public consultation prior to any planni ng applications being approved . Any loss of 
floodplain at this location should be mitigated by the creation of additional/compensatory floodplain which should 
secure wider environmental and sustainability benefits including provision of appropriate ecologi cal and biodiversity 
enhancement.  Controls using legal agreements will be required to control the extent and types of use that take place 
on the site, particularly in respect of retailing which will be tightly controlled. Section 106 planning obligations w ill also 
make provision for any necessary infrastructure and public transport improvements.  Priority habitats exist within the 
site and in line with criterion d) of Policy J27 should be protected an enhanced.  103

3.186  Twenty -five h ousing sites are allocated in rural areas and are considered  achievable in principle, 
corresponding to rural settlement maps that accompany this document.  Most housing allocations in rural areas are 
expected to deliver around 20 dwellings per hectare due to the low density character of existing village development,  
but in some cases a higher or lower density is justified.

Newton Square, Bampton  
 
A site of 0.25 hectares to the rear of Newton Square, Bampton is allocated for residential 
development, subject to the following:  
 
a) 5 dwellings;  
b) Provision is made on site for the parking of delivery vehicles servin g the convenience store at 4 -6 
Newton Square;  
c) Design which respects and enhances the character and appearance of the Conservation Area; 
and 
d) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation measures.  
 
3.190  The site comprises land to the rear o f the existing convenience store. It is suitable being a brownfield site, 
lying partially within the existing settlement limit. The majority of the site lies within the Conservation Area where 
development should preserve or enhance the character and settin g of the area. Access is likely to be obtainable only 
through the existing access off Newton Court which serves the convenience store and through which deliveries are 
made. Due to the width of the access, Newton Court is not suitable for the regular parkin g of delivery vehicles and 
provision should be made within the development site for this activity.  
 
3.191  The site lies in an area of archaeological potential within the historic core of Bampton, so a programme of 
archaeological investigation will be requ ired, with mitigation measures if necessary.

 Policy BA2 
 
Stone Crushing Works (Scott’s Quarry), Bampton  
 
A site of 0.45 hectares at Scott’s Quarry, Bampton is allocated for mixed -use development, subject to 
the following:  
 
a) 18 dwellings with 30% affor dable housing;  
b) 355 square metres of commercial floor space;  
c) Protection of mature trees within the site;  
d) Removal of spoil heap;  
e) Site contamination assessment and remediation where appropriate; and   
f) Provision of a drainage strategy and sustain able urban drainage scheme to deal with all surface 
water from the development and arrangements for future maintenance.  
 
3.192  The site is the remaining part of a previous allocation.  The site is bounded by mature trees on two sides 
(north and west) and c urrently contains a large spoil heap within the middle of the site. There is existing access which 
serves Woodland Close. An appeal decision has allowed mixed use development on the remaining employment part 
of the site, comprising 18 dwellings (including four affordable dwellings) and 6 B1 units (with a floorspace of 355 
square metres).  Should a revised scheme for the site be submitted, the current target of 30% affordable housing 
would apply as the starting point for negotiation.  
 
3.193  The history of qu arrying at the site highlights the possibility of the presence of contaminated land. Developing 
the site would require removal of the large spoil heap. Groundwater flooding maps show a 20 -25% chance of 
groundwater emergence within the site boundary. Any pl anning application on the site will need to be accompanied by 
a drainage strategy which takes account of the potential for groundwater flooding in addition to considering surface 
water runoff.  The subsequent design of the Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme  will need to be appropriate to the 
conditions identified.  Suitable drainage is a standard requirement of Policies S9 and DM1 but the requirement is 
reiterated in Policy BA2 for clarity due to the specific potential of this site for groundwater flooding.  
 
 
Policy BA3 
 
Ashleigh Park, Bampton  
 
A site of 0.3 hectares at Ashleigh Park, Bampton is allocated for residential development, subject to 
the following:  
 
a) 7 dwellings with 30% affordable housing which may be in the form of a  financial contribution to  
provide the affordable dwellings in another  location;  
b) Access is obtained off the existing estate road; and  
c) Provision is made to replace any loss of allocated parking for existing dwellings in Ashleigh Park.  
 
3.194  The site comprises agricultural la nd at the end of the existing cul -de-sac development of Ashleigh Park. The 
site slopes downwards from south to north, with the northern part of the site the flattest and the southern extent the 
steepest part of the site. Access is likely to involve the dem olition of the garage serving 33 Ashleigh Park and this loss 
of allocated parking provision should be replaced to ensure adequate allocated parking provision is retained.  
 
  107 
 Policy BA4  
 
School Close, Bampton  
 
A site of 0.7 hectares at School Close, Bampto n is allocated for residential  development subject to the 
following:  
 
 a)  26 dwellings with 3 0% affordable housing;   
 b)  Access to be achieved off West Street;  
 c)  Traffic calming measures along West Street;  
 d)  Provision of a pedestrian footpath along  West Street to link with the entrance to the site on    
West Street; and  
 e)  Provision of a Drainage Strategy and a Sustainable Urban Drainage  Scheme to deal with all 
surface water from the development and arrangements for future maintenance.  
 
3.194a  This greenfield site is located towards the south of the former primary school and forms the  remaining part of 
a previous allocation. It slopes upwards from north to south with the higher  ground of the former school site on 
approximately the same level as th at of the lower portions  of the site . 
 
3.194b  An application for 26 dwellings and associated vehicular and pedestrian accesses was  granted outline 
permission by the Council in April 2013 subject to conditions. The permission  includes 7 affordable units an d 
consequently, the policy provides the criteria to be applied as  a starting point, should any revised scheme be 
submitted.   
 
3.194c  Parts of West Street are narrow and it is a Devon County Council Highways requirement that  
improvements, in the form of tr affic calming measures, shall be made to the section  immediately to the east of the 
access point and include the provision of a pedestrian path to  link with an existing path further along West Street.

Land adjacent to Hollywell, Bow  
 
A site of  1.2 hectares at land adjacent Hollywell, Bow is allocated for residential development, subject 
to the following:  
 
a) 20 dwellings with 30% affordable housing;  
b) Site access to come off Station Road via north west corner through  the ‘Hollywell’ building; and 
c) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation measures.  
 
3.195  The site is located within the village of Bow, along its southern border adjoining farmland and the open 
countryside. It is a flat agricultural field surrounded by hedging.  Th e site is to the rear of a small number of detached 
bungalows, set in low density plots immediately to the west. Due to the large number of existing accesses further 
south along Station Road, advice from the Highway Authority states that a suitable access can only be achieved into 
the site via the north west corner where the boundary abuts Station Road.  The existing house, ‘Hollywell’, will 
therefore need to be demolished to deliver the required access.  However, an alternative access option will be 
consid ered if a suitable scheme can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Highway Authority.  
 
3.196  This site lies in an area of archaeological potential, with prehistoric settlement and funerary activity recorded 
in the vicinity. Therefore, investigation o f archaeology on the site will be required, with mitigation if necessary.

West of Godfreys Gardens, Bow  
 
A site of 0.23 hectares West of Godfreys Gardens is allocated for affordable  housing, subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 6 dwellings with 100 % affordable housing;  
b) Provision of a pedestrian route linking Godfreys Gardens with Bow Mill Lane;  
c) Archaeological investigations and appropriate mitigation measures; and  
d) Access from Godfrey Gardens.  
 
3.197  This greenfield site lies to the west of a residential area within Bow. It slopes generally from east to west with 
borders of hedgerow and trees and the retention of those features would ensure that landscape impact is minimal. An 
application for 6 affordable units and associated access road, par king and drainage was granted permission by the 
Council in April 2014 subject to conditions. Provision of a pedestrian through route linking Bow Mill Lane to the west 
ensures pedestrian and cycling access for existing and new residents to the village shop.  
3.198  This site lies in an area of archaeological potential, with prehistoric settlement and funerary activity recorded 
in the vicinity. Therefore, archaeological investigation of the site will be required, and mitigation if necessary.

Hele  Road, Bradninch  
 
A site of 0.3 hectares at Hele Road is allocated for residential development, subject to the following:  
 
a) 7 dwellings with 30% affordable housing which may be in the form of a  financial contribution to 
provide affordable dwellings in a nother location;  
b) Access point to be located on the northern part of the site frontage on to  Hele Road; and  
c) Archaeological investigations and appropriate mitigation measures.  
 
3.199  This site is located on the edge of the settlement of Bradninch; it i s immediately adjacent to the settlement 
boundary and also has a boundary with the highway. There is housing to the western side of the site on the opposite 
side of the road. Services and shops are located in the village centre which is in close proximity.  A bus stop is 
positioned adjacent to the site, and there are large trees surrounding the site. The site is located on a fairly busy road, 
and the bus stop may need to be moved from its current position if the site is developed.  An adequate access is 
achievable to the north of the site.  
 
3.200  The site lies in an area of archaeological potential demonstrated by the presence of prehistoric sites identified 
through aerial photography. Therefore, archaeological investigation of the site will be required, and mitigation if 
necessary.

Barton, Chawleigh  
 
A site of 1.25 hectares at the Barton is allocated for residential development, subject to the following:  
 
a) 20 dwellings with 30% affordable housing;  
b) Access t o be achieved off School Close;  
c)  Design solution which respects the setting of the conservation area and listed buildings; and  
d) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation measures.  
 
3.201  The site comprises part of an agricultural field to the north of the village of C hawleigh. The south western 
corner of the field contains a completed rural exception site named School Close. Access can be achieved off the 
exception site but road capacity should limit development to a maximum of 20 dwellings. The site is located in an a rea 
of archaeological potential and records indicate the presence of a prehistoric burial site. Therefore, archaeological 
investigation of the site will be required, and mitigation if necessary.  Appropriate landscaping will be required to 
mitigate any pot ential impacts on the conservation area and listed buildings, including the grade I church which lies to 
the south east.

Land off Church Lane, Cheriton Bishop  
 
A site of 1. 4 hectares at Land off Church Lane, Cheriton Bishop is allocated for r esidential 
development, subject to the following:  
 
a) 20 dwellings with 30% affordable housing, subject to Transport Assessment;  
b) Assessment of the capacity of the junction of Churc h Lane and the main road (C50);  
c) Widening of Church Lane and provision of a footpath along site frontage; and  
d)  Provision of a landscape buffer along the northern boundary of the site.  
 
3.202  This site comprises part of a field located on the east side of Church Lane and to the north of Hescane Park.  
The site is located be tween the older part of the village to the north, and the more modern development to the south 
known as Cheriton Cross.  There is the opportunity to integrate more closely the two elements of the village by 
developing this site.  The land gently undulates,  dropping away further to the east.  Landscape impacts are likely to be 
low as there is existing housing along the southern and western boundaries, which will mitigate some of the impact.  
 
3.203  The junction of Church Lane with the main road to the south o f the site may place a limitation on the number 
of dwellings that can be achieved.  Any planning application should be accompanied by a Transport Assessment 
which should assess the capacity of the junction to accommodate additional vehicles.  Improvements may be required 
to the junction as a result.  The widening of Church Lane along the site frontage will be necessary and a footpath will 
also be needed along the site frontage linking up with the existing provision to the south.  A design solution which 
provides the footpath on the inside of replacement planting to offset the loss of the hedgerow will be looked upon 
favourably at the planning application stage.  
 
3.204  A small watercourse runs along the southern boundary of the site.  A flood risk assessment will need to 
consider the potential for flooding.  An onsite Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme will require implementation to 
negate any increase in flood risk.  Suitable drainage is a standard requirement of Policies S9 and DM1.

A site of 0.3 hectares at Barnshill Close, Cheriton Fitzpaine is allocated for residential development, 
subject to the following:  
 
a) 7 dwellings with 30% affordable housing which may be in the form of a financial contribution to 
provide the affordable dwellings in another location.  
 
3.205  This site forms a rectangular block of land lying between the new school to the east and Barnshill Close to the 
west.  It is a natural infill site which already has an existing access point to th e south.  The site is on higher ground 
than the road to the south, though any visual impact is likely to be minimal given the neighbouring uses .  The site lies 
outside but relatively close to the edge of the conservation area. Appropriate design and choice  of materials should 
ensure that there is no detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the historic environment.

a) 22 dwellings with 30% affordable housing.  
 
3.206  This site forms an elongated and roughly triangular -shaped block of land lying on the eastern side of the 
village.  It sits adjacent to the new primary school to the west.  Developing the site will connect the White Cross area 
to the east with the remainder of the village.   The local landscape is undulating, however the site is relatively flat.  The  
adjacent school, and housing at White Cross wil l mitigate some of the visual impact.

The Old Abattoir, Copplestone  
 
A site of 1.5 hectares at The Old Abattoir, Copplestone is allocated for residential development and a 
car park subject to the following:  
 
a) 30 dwellings with 30% affordabl e housing, subject to viability;  
b) 100 space railway station car park in the eastern part of the site;  
c) The existing access point off Shambles Drive to serve both the housing and the car park; and  
d) Assessment of land contamination and appropriate reme diation.  
 
3.207  This site is located on the northern boundary of the village of Copplestone.  It comprises a field with a number 
of dilapidated outbuildings.  A small slaughterhouse once stood in the north east corner, though little trace of this now 
remai ns. It is not anticipated that there will be any harmful visual impact associated with developing this site.  
 
3.208  Devon County Council has highlighted the need for a railway station car park at Copplestone.  The eastern 
portion of the site, equating to a pproximately 0.25 hectares is allocated for provision of a 100 space car park.  There is 
an existing access point off Shambles Drive which can service both the housing and the car park.  It is anticipated that 111 
 the car parking provision can also be used by residents.   Should the cost of providing the car park make the 
development financially unviable, the Council will consider a reduced affordable housing provision subject to 
submission of robust viability evidence from the developer which justifies such a reduction.  
 
3.209  There is the potential for land contamination associated with the slaughterhouse.  Any planning application 
must be accompanied by a contaminated land report, and appropriate remediation will be required if necessary.

provide t he affordable dwellings in another location;  
b) Landscaping and design which protect the setting of the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty; and  
c) Archaeological investigation and mitigation.  
 
3.211  This is a greenfield site consisting of the south west corner of a field at the northern end of the village.  The 
site was allocated for 100% affordable housing in 2010 but has not come forward.  It is now allocated for a mixture of 
market and affordable housing, which is considered more likely to deliver the site whilst providing some housing for 
local needs.  Given the sloping nature of the field and the location on the edge of Culmstock, the development should 
be sensitively designed with landscaping which protects the setting of the Blackdown  Hills Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty.

provide the affordable dwellings in another location;  and 
b) Provision of a Drainage Strategy and a Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme to deal with all 
surface water from the developm ent and arrangements for future maintenance . 
 
3.212  The site comprises part of a field to the south western edge of Halberton and sits adjacent to modern housing. 
The south eastern corner of the field was granted planning permission in 2006 and has been bu ilt out as a rural 
exception site. Groundwater flooding maps show a 25-50% chance of groundwater emergence within the site 
boundary. Any planning application on the site will need to be accompanied by a Drainage Strategy which takes 
account of the potentia l for groundwater flooding in addition to considering surface water runoff.  The subsequent 
design of the Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme will need to be appropriate to the conditions identified.  Suitable 
drainage is a standard requirement of Policies S 9 and DM1 but this is reiterated in Policy HA1 for clarity due to the 
specific potential for groundwater flooding on this site.  The site lies a short distance from the edge of the conservation 
area. Appropriate design, choice of materials and landscaping should ensure that there is no detrimental impact on

3.217  The site comprises agricultural land to the west of Morchard Bishop. It is bounded by allotmen t to the west of 
the site, residential development to the east and by a highway and farmstead to the south. The south east corner of 
the site was previously allocated for 10 affordable dwellings but is now proposed for a mixture of market and 
affordable ho using.  
 
3.218  There may be some wildlife interest from hedgerows which bound the site, so this should be investigated and 
mitigation measures proposed where appropriate. The site lies to the west of a possible prehistoric funerary 
monument. Any development  here has the potential to expose archaeological and artefactual deposits associated with 
this, so any application will need to be accompanied by appropriate investigations.  
 
3.219  To enable appropriate access to the site the policy requires road widening  across the site frontage and a 
secondary pedestrian link to the estate to the east.  Replacement of the Devon Bank should be incorporated into the 
design of the access point to mitigate for any loss.  113 
  
Policy NE1  
 
Court Orchard, Newton St Cyres  
 
A site of 2.7 hectares at Court Orchard, Newton St Cyres is allocated for residential development and 
a new primary school, subject to the following:  
 
a) 25 dwellings with 30% affordable housing, subject to viability;  
b) A site of 1.1 hectares for a new primary scho ol at no cost to the Local Education Authority;  
c)  Design which respects the setting of the conservation area;  
d) Archaeological investigations and appropriate mitigation measures;  
e) School sports provision only within flood zones 2 and 3 to the east of  the site; and  
f) Widening of Station Road to reduce congestion.  
 
3.220  The site lies on the northern edge of the village of Newton St Cyres adjacent to an existing housing estate. It 
is currently an apple orchard bounded by hedgerows on all sides which ar e occasionally interspersed by trees.  
 
3.221  The site has been identified by Devon County Council as an appropriate site for the relocation of the existing 
primary school. The policy therefore requires the provision of a site for the new primary school as part of this 
development.  Areas in flood zones 2 and 3 of the site should be used for school sports provision only.  Should the 
cost of providing the school site make the development financially unviable, the Council will consider a reduced 
affordable hou sing provision subject to submission of robust viability evidence from the developer which justifies such 
a reduction.  
 
3.222  The widening of Station Road to reduce congestion is also required by the policy.  There may be some wildlife 
interest from hedger ows which bound the site and trees within the site, so the impact on protected species should be 
assessed and mitigation measures included where appropriate. The conservation area boundary was revised in 2015 
and now extends up to the  south western boundar y of the site. Careful design will be required to ensure the 
development  can be sensitively accommodated.  The site lies in an area of archaeological potential and therefore any 
application will need to be accompanied by appropriate investigations.

Former Tiverton Parkway Hotel, Sampford Peverell  
 
A site of 0.45 hectares at the former Tiverton Parkway Hotel, Sampford Peverell is allocated for 
residential development and a doctors’ surgery, subject to the following:  
 
a) 10 dwellings with 30% af fordable housing which may be in the form of a   
 financial contribution to provide the affordable dwellings in another location, subject to viability;  
b) Provision of a doctors’ surgery;  
c) Provision of a drainage strategy and Sustainable Urban Drainage S cheme to deal with all surface 
water from the dev elopment and arrangements for future maintenance; and  
d) Mitigation of any wildlife impact including protection of hedgerows.  
 
3.223  This site is located on the eastern edge of Sampford Peverell. It was the  location of the Tiverton Parkway 
Hotel, which has since been demolished. The site received planning permission in 2008 for a care home. An updated 
application in 2012 was consented for a 58 bed scheme and adjoining GP surgery. The applicants have since st ated 
that they will no longer be pursuing this development and the site is available for housing. Any housing development 114 
 should include the provision for a GP surgery. Should the cost of providing the GP surgery make the development 
unviable, the Council will consider a reduced affordable housing provision subject to submission of robust viability 
evidence from the developer which justifies such a reduction.  
 
3.224  Groundwater flooding maps show a 0-25% chance of groundwater emergence within the site bound ary. Any 
planning application on the site will need to be accompanied by a Drainage Strategy which takes account of the 
potential for groundwater flooding in addition to considering surface water runoff.  The subsequent design of the 
Sustainable Urban Drai nage Scheme will need to be appropriate to the conditions identified.  Suitable drainage is a 
standard requirement of Policies S9 and DM1 but the requirement is reiterated in Policy SP1 for clarity due to the 
specific potential for groundwater emergence on  this site.  There may also be some wildlife interest from hedgerows 
which bound the site, so the potential impact on protected species should be assessed and mitigation measures 
included if appropriate . 
 
Policy SP2  
 
Higher Town, Sampford Peverell  
 
A site of 6 hectares at Higher Town, Sampford Peverell is allocated for a low density residential 
development , subject to the following:    
 
a)  No more than 60 dwellings with 30% affordable housing;  
b)  Landscaping and design which respect the setting and charact er of the area, conservation area s 
and listed building;  
c)  Provision of a drainage strategy and Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme  to deal with all surface 
water from the development and arrangements for future maintenance;  
d)  Mitigation of any wildlife i mpact including protection of hedgerows;  
e)  Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation  
f) 2.5 hectares of Green Infrastructure laid out and managed with landscaping and open space ; and  
g)    Improved access to the village for pedestrians and  cyclists .   
 
3.224a  The site is on the edge of Sampford Peverell, outside the main built up part of the  village. The site is elevated 
and will require careful landscaping and mitigation measures.  Development of the highest ground should remain as 
undevel oped green infrastructure. Low density and good design will be required to respect the existing character of 
edge -of village housing, conservation area and listed building.  The site is currently bounded by hedgerow. Some loss 
of hedgerow would be required  to enable access however, careful design should be considered to  minimise this 
impact including incorporating new hedgerow into the design of the  development.  
 
3.224b  This site lies in an area of archaeological potential with the Historic Environment Rec ord recording prehistoric 
activity. Any application will need to be accompanied by archaeological  investigation and appropriate mitigation.

Fanny’s Lane, Sandford   
 
A site of 1.5 hectares at Fanny’s Lane, Sandford is allocated for residentia l development, subject to 
the following:  
 
a) 27 dwellings with 30% affordable housing;  
b) Buffer strip of planting or open space to protect the setting of the listed Park House and Sandford 
Conservation area; and  115 
 c) Careful design and landscaping to protec t views towards Sandford and the historic core around 
St Swithun’s Church.  
 
3.225  The site comprises mainly greenfield land which is located within the village of Sandford. Part of the site was 
previously allocated and planning permission was granted for 1 9 dwellings on the northern part of the site in 2013. 
The site size has been enlarged from that which has planning permission to accommodate a limited number of 
additional dwellings.  As such the number of houses required by the policy of 27 includes the 1 9 which are currently 
consented, resulting in a net gain of 8 dwellings.  
 
3.226  The site lies adjacent to the conservation area and the western boundary of the site abuts the curtilage of a 
listed building.  A buffer strip of planting or open space should be provided to protect the setting of this listed building. 
Careful design and landscaping is also required to avoid the development dominating views towards Sandford from 
the south east and to retain the emphasis on the historic core of St Swithun’s Churc h and to protect the setting of the 
conservation area.

Land at Old Butterleigh Road, Silverton  
 
A site of 0.35 hectares at Old Butterleigh Road is allocated for residential development subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 8 dwellings with 30% affor dable housing which may be in the form of a  financial contribution to 
provide the affordable dwellings in another location;  
b) No development on the floodplain to the east of the site;  
c) Widening of carriageway over site frontage and provision of grass v erge; and  
d) Design and layout to respect the character of the Conservation Area.  
 
3.227  The site falls on the northern boundary of the village of Silverton and is on the eastern side of Old Butterleigh 
Road. The site is shielded to the north and west by h igh hedges which limit inward views.  
 
3.228  A small watercourse runs along the eastern boundary of the site and the small area of floodplain associated 
with this should not be developed.   
 
3.229  The carriageway will need to be widened across the site fron tage to accommodate two passing vehicles.  The 
footpath network terminates some distance to the south of the site.  Rather than provide a new footway which does 
not connect with existing provision, a grass verge along the site frontage should be provided a s defensible space for 
pedestrians.  
 
Policy SI2 
 
The Garage, Silverton  
A site of 0.11 hectares at The Garage, Silverton is allocated for residential development subject to the 
following:  
 
a) 5 dwellings;  
b) Design and layout which respects the character of  the Conservation Area;  
c) Suitable design and layout of access arrangements; and  
d) Site contamination and remediation where appropriate.  
 116 
 3.230  This is a small brownfield site which is located adjacent to a complex of residential dwellings, which is 
separated from and to the south of the main body of the village of Silverton. The site currently comprises an industrial 
unit which is used for storage and maintenance of vehicles.  
 
3.231  The design of the site is important as it lies at the edge of the vil lage’s Conservation Area, being the first 
complex of buildings encountered when approaching Silverton along Newcourt Road. Design of the access to serve 
the five dwellings will need to be provided having specific regard to the neighbouring access serving t he adjacent barn 
conversions and detailing appropriate visibility splays.  
 
3.232  There is also the potential for land contamination as a result of the history of vehicle repair and fuel storage on 
the site. Assessment will therefore be required and remedia tion to take place where appropriate.

South of Broadlands, Thorverton  
 
A site of 0.7 hectares at South of Broadlands in Thorverton is allocated for residential development 
subject to the following:  
 
a) 12 dwellings with 30% affordable hous ing; 
b) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation; and  
c) Road widening and provision of footpath along site frontage extending northwards to connect 
with the existing network at the entrance to the Broadlands estate.  
 
3.233  The site to the s outh of the village on the edge of the settlement. There is limited highway frontage to the C23. 
Road widening and a footpath north into the village, connecting to the existing provision at the entrance to the 
Broadlands estate will be required.  The land required for the footpath is in the ownership of Devon County Council 
who currently maintain it as a grass verge.  
 
3.234  The site is to the north of a large prehistoric enclosure and development will need to be supported by an 
appropriate level of archaeol ogical works to allow the significance of the heritage asset to be understood.   
 
3.235  As the site is partially located within a grou ndwater Source Protection Zone appropriate forms of sustainable 
urban drainage should be used.

Land west of Uffculme, Uffculme  
 
A site of 3.49 hectares at land west of Uffculme, Uffculme, is allocated for residential development 
subject to the following:  
 
a) 60 dwellings with 35% affordable housing;  
b) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation; and  
c) Provision of a drainage strategy and Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme  to deal with all surface 
water from the de velopment and arrangements for future maintenance.  
 
3.238  The site is located to the west of Uffculme, adjacent to Uffculme Road. It compr ises an agricultural field 
together with part of the rear garden belonging to the property known as Harvesters. The field has a frontage onto 117 
 Uffculme Road from which access would be taken. An appeal decision has granted outline planning permission on the 
site for 60 dwellings with 35% affordable housing. The policy provides the criteria to be applied as a starting point, 
should any revised scheme be submitted. The site occupies an area where prehistoric activity is recorded in the wider 
landscape. Archaeol ogical investigation and appropriate mitigation will therefore be required.

Land east of M5, Willand  
 
A site of 2.9 hectares at land east of M5, Willand, is allocated for residential development subject to 
the following:  
 
a) 42 dwellings with 30% affordable housing;  
b) Provision of buffer zone and appropriate planting to mitigate noise from the adjacent motorway;  
c) Mitigation of any wildlife impac t including protection of trees ; 
d) Transport assessment of capacity at the junction of Silver St reet and Meadow Park; and  
e) Retention and enhancement of the public right of way.  
 
3.236  The site is located to the south of Willand, adjacent to modern housing to the north and the M5 to the west.  
Noise from the M5 should be mitigated by a buffer zone a nd planting along the boundary to ensure residential amenity 
is not adversely affected. The site has a number of mature trees on the eastern boundary and established woodland 
along the north east boundary. Mitigation measures should be taken to ensure ther e are no adverse impacts on any of 
the surrounding biodiversity.  
 
3.237  A Transport Assessment of the capacity of the junction of Silver Street and Meadow Park may result in a 
different number of dwellings from the number allocated. The current public foo tpath across the northern boundary of 
the site should be retained and enhanced.

b) Archaeological investigation and appropriate mitigation.  
 
3.238   This site comprises level land within and adjoining the existing Willand Industrial Estate.  It is part of a larger 
site allocated in the previ ous Local Plan which has partly been developed. Access has now been secured to Phase 2 
and an application for nearly 13,000 sqm of employment units has been submitted . This application would facilitate the 
relocation of Pallex from the neighbouring industr ial estate to a purpose built Regional Distribution Centre within 
Phase 2 whilst providing a range of different sized units to meet market demand. It is anticipated that any remaining 
unconsented parts of the site could come forward over the plan period.  118

 Sustainable development principles  
Policy DM1  
 
High quality design  
 
Designs of new development must be of high quality, based upon and demonstrating the following 
principles:  
 
a) Clear understanding of the characteristics of th e site, its wider context and the surrounding area;  
b)  Efficient and effective use of the site, having regard to criterion (a);  
c)  Positive contribution to local character including any heritage or  biodiversity assets and the 
setting of heritage assets;  
d)  Creation of safe and accessible places that also encourage and enable sustainable modes of 
travel such as walking and cycling;  
e)  Visually attractive places that are well integrated with surrounding  buildings, streets and 
landscapes, and do not have a n unacceptably  adverse effect on the privacy and amenity of the 
proposed or  neighbouring properties and uses, taking account of:  
 i)  Architecture  
 ii)  Siting, layout, scale and massing  
 iii)  Orientation and fenestration  
 iv)  Materials, landscaping and green infrastructure  
f)  Appropriate drainage including sustainable drainage systems (SUDS), including arrangements for 
future maintenance, and connection of foul drainage to a mains sewer where available ; 
g)  Adequate levels of daylight, sunlight and priv acy to private amenity spaces and principal 
windows;  
h)  Suitably sized rooms and overall floorspace which allows for adequate storage and movement 
within the building together as set out in the Nationally Described Space Standard with external 
spaces for recycling, refuse and cycle storage; and  
i)  On sites of 10 houses of more the provision of 20% of dwellings built to Level 2 of Building 
Regulations Part M ‘access to and use of dwellings’ .  
 
4.1 National policy recognises that good design is a key aspect  of sustainable development, is indivisible from 
good planning, and ensures that new development contributes positively to making places better for people. Policies 
S1 and S9 set out the Council’s strategic objectives for locally distinctive, high quality development, including design 
which reinforces the character and legibility of the built environment and creates attractive places. Policy DM1 builds 
on this by setting out detailed criteria to guide high quality design on individual development sites.  
 
4.2 The Mid Devon Town and Village Character Assessment identifies and evaluates the settlement character of 
the district, including patterns and similarities, distribution of land use, materials and key features of interest. The 
Devon and Mid Devon Landsca pe Character Assessments provide the equivalent information pertaining to landscape 
in the district. While the level of information expected to accompany a planning application will vary depending on the 
development being proposed, applications for new bui ldings within or adjacent to towns and villages should 
demonstrate an understanding of the surrounding built environment. Where available, Conservation Area Appraisals 
will also provide an essential source of information for proposals within conservation a reas. In addition to an 
understanding of local character and heritage, development proposals must respect the needs of neighbouring 
residents and the community, through the design of safe, accessible and attractive places that preserve general 
quality of l ife. 
 
4.3 In creating visually attractive places that incorporate landscaping and green infrastructure, applicants are 
advised to consult Biodiversity by Design, published by the Town and Country Planning Association  for examples of 
how green infrastructur e has been used to enhance the quality of development.  120 
  
4.4 Designs should maximise opportunities for the use of sustainable transport modes for the movement of goods 
or people. National policy states that developments should be located and designed where practical to accommodate 
the efficient delivery of goods and supplies; prioritise pedestrian and cycle movements; have access to public 
transport; deliver safe and secure layouts that minimise conflicts between cars and pedestrians/cyclists; incorporate 
facilities for plug -in and other ultra -low emission vehicles; and consider the needs of people with disabilities by all 
modes of transport. Walking and cycling routes should be high quality, attractive and direct.  
 
4.5 Development proposals must also accord with sustainable waste management principles, the requirements 
for which are set out in Policy W4 ‘Waste Prevention’ within the Devon Waste Plan. The Devon County Council Waste 
Management and Infrastructure SPD should also be a material consideration.  Deve lopment proposals should 
demonstrate compliance with this policy as part of the Design and Access Statement, where applicable. This is an 
essential step in the district’s transition to more sustainable resource management, with the long -term aim of zero -
waste or resource -neutral  construction.  
 
4.5a Soft landscaped SuDs are best placed to provide water quantity, water quality, public amenity and biodiversity 
benefits. When considering SuDs there is a preference for ‘soft’ landscaped solutions which should be  sought in the 
first instance where possible and appropriate. Robust evidence should be provided where no soft landscaped 
solutions are used.  
 
4.5b    National policy states that planning should always seek to secure high quality design and a good standard  of 
amenity for all existing and future occupants of land and buildings. This is particularly important for the design of the 
homes that people live in and the spaces that surround those homes. The aim in Mid Devon is to deliver high quality 
buildings and spaces that meet the needs of users, taking account of an aging population whilst ensuring compatibility 
with surrounding development and uses. Though compliance is delivered through building regulations, criterion i) will 
be implemented through a conditio n attached to the planning permission.  
 
 
Policy DM2 
 
Renewable and low carbon energy  
 
The benefits of renewable and low carbon energy development will be weighed against its impact.  
Proposals will be permitted where they do not have significant adverse im pacts on the character, 
amenity and visual quality of the area, including cumulative impacts of such developments within the 
parish or adjoining parishes.  Proposals must demonstrate that impacts are or can be made 
acceptable  in relation to :  
 
a) Landscape  character and the character and setting of heritage assets;  
b) Environmental amenity of nearby properties and the wider locality;  
c) Quality and productivity of the best and most versatile agricultural land (grades 1, 2 and 3a); and  
d) Biodiversity (avoid ing habitat fragmentation).   
 
4.6 Policy DM2 seeks to maximise renewable and low carbon energy while ensuring that adverse impacts are 
addressed satisfactorily, including cumulative impacts.  Examples of development considered under this policy include 
hydropowe r, solar installations, and energy systems associated with other development such as combined heat and 
power (CHP) or district heating.  Any wind turbine proposals will be considered in the context of national policy  which 
requires planning applicat ions for such development  to only be granted if the development site is in an area identified 
as suitable  for wind energy development in Local  or Neighbourhood Plans. Following consideration of the evidence 
commissioned, the Council  has concluded that it d oes not propose to identify such areas at a district level. This does 
not preclude suitable areas for wind energy development to come forward in Neighbourhood  Plans.   
 121 
 4.7 These developments, especially when they are of a commercial scale, have the potenti al to cause significant 
harm through degradation of landscape character or heritage, impact to local residents and loss of productive 
agricultural land and biodiversity.  Development proposals will be required to demonstrate that impacts are or can be 
made  acceptable, through supporting studies and surveys as appropriate.  As a starting point, development proposals 
should have reference to the Mid Devon Landscape Character Assessment (2011), the Landscape Sensitivity Study 
(2013) and the Government’s Planni ng Practice Guidance for Renewable and Low Carbon Energy (July 2013).  
Depending on the proposal, Policies DM4 (pollution), DM25 (heritage assets), DM27 (protected landscapes) and 
DM28 (other protected sites) may also have a bearing on whether planning per mission is granted.  
 
4.8 In some cases, Devon County Council will act as the Local Planning Authority in dealing with an application 
for planning permission.  For instance, renewable and low carbon energy proposals that use waste m aterials 
originating fro m outside the site as the fuel will normally be determined by Devon County Council as the waste 
planning authority.  
 
 
Policy DM3  
 
Transport and air quality  
 
Development must ensure safe access to the transport network.  Development proposals that would 
give rise to significant levels of vehicular movement must be accompanied by an integrated Transport 
Assessment, Travel Plan, traffic pollution assessment and Low Emission Assessment.  The traffic 
pollution assessment must consider the impact of traffic -gene rated nitrogen oxides on environmental 
assets including protected sites listed in Policy DM28, and propose mitigation measures where 
appropriate.  The Low Emission Assessment shall include the following:  
 
a)  Assessment of the impact on existing Air Qualit y Management Areas, or an impact likely to result 
in the declaratio n of an additional Air Quality Management Area, in cases where a demonstrable 
negative impact on ambient concentrations of air pollutants is considered likely;  
b) Modelling of local residu al road transport emissions from the development without mitigation 
measures; and  
c) Onsite mitigation measures to reduce negative impacts on local air quality.  
 
4.9 A Transport Assessment is a comprehensive and systematic process that sets out transport i ssues relating to 
a proposed development.  It identifies what measures will be required to improve accessibility and safety for all modes 
of travel, particularly for alternatives to the car such as walking, cycling and public transport and what measures 
should be taken to deal with the anticipated transport impacts of the development.  
 
4.9a  A Transport Statement is similar to a Transport Assessment but is less detailed and can be  used in some 
cases where transport issues arising from the development propos als do not  require a full Transport Assessment. 
Where a Transport Statement in lieu of a Transport  Assessment is considered acceptable this will be agreed by the 
planning authority in  consultation with Devon County Council as the highway authority. All maj or applications will  
require a Transport Assessment unless advised by the planning authority.  
 
4.10 A Travel Plan is a long -term management strategy for an organisation or site that seeks to deliver sustainable 
transport objectives.   Travel plans should e ncourage the use of alternatives to single -occupancy car use by 
prioritising pedestrian and cycle movements through the site, providing appropriate facilities, and implementing 
initiatives that encourage sustainable travel.  Clear outcomes should be set ou t that link to an appropriate package of 
measures which should where suitable, include the promotion of:  
 
 • Walking and cycling    • Public transport  
 • Rail services    • Car sharing  122 
  • Eco-driving such as low emission vehicles  • Motorcycle safety   
 • Car clubs    • Flexible working practices  
 
Travel plans should include details of how the progress of the travel plan will be monitored and reported.  
 
4.11 Applicants are advised to engage in pre -application discussions with the Council and Devon County Counc il 
as Highway Authority if the development is likely to generate significant levels of vehicular movement, to discuss the 
scope and detail of the information required.  Whether or not an application’s traffic impact is considered ‘significant’ 
will depend on a range of factors such as the location of the development, its relationship to an Air Quality 
Management Area, its intended use and the capacity of the road network. The requirement will not usually apply to 
small -scale development, but occasionally a development not classed as ‘major’ may still have a significant impact. 
Where an integrated assessment is required, the Council will usually require an analysis of traffic flows at key periods 
and the ‘mass emissions’ or total emission footprint to be expe cted from the development.  Where criterion (a) of the 
policy applies, the assessment should also focus on key road links.  The Council will require development proposals to 
demonstrate that they will not cause significant harm to people or the environment  through an increase in traffic -
related pollutants.  A traffic pollution assessment should consider the effects that additional emissions from vehicles 
will have on any environmental assets, including important wildlife habitats. This may be combined with an 
assessment under Policy DM4, if appropriate. In particular, development that increases traffic along the A361 may 
have an impact on the Special Area of Conservation at Rackenford, which adjoins the Mid Devon boundary.  Where a 
development would cause si gnificant harm to this site and adequate mitigation would not be possible, planning 
permission will be refused.  
 
4.12 Developments affecting the Special Area of Conservation could include:  
 
 • Intensive farming  
 • Commercial riding stables  
 • Employment de velopment  
 • Tourism  
 • Gypsy and traveller sites  
 • Any other developments that increase cross -traffic along the A361  
 
4.13 The Transport Assessment should identify the boundaries of the Low Emission Assessment, which evaluates 
the effect of the developm ent on local air quality.  The main routes of travel will be assessed for their residual road 
transport emissions after development, with and without mitigating measures to reduce emissions.  The Low Emission 
Assessment must also take account of existing A ir Quality Management Areas (Cullompton and Crediton), and include 
air quality exposure modelling for specified residential properties or other sensitive properties either within or adjoining 
an Air Quality Management Area or in a location at risk of being  designated as one if a demonstrable harm has been 
identified.  There are a number of standard models used for air quality exposure modelling, which should be carried 
out by a suitably qualified person.  Procedural guidance for carrying out a Low Emission Assessment is contained in 
Annex 2.  
 
4.14 Tiverton is at risk of being designated an Air Quality Management Area.  Any relevant development proposal 
in or adjoining Tiverton, Cullompton and Crediton should consider the significance of its impact on the mo st congested 
routes within the town and the properties most directly affected by the development.  Where mitigation measures are 
necessary, these should be designed to reduce both the direct impacts to nearby properties and an Air Quality 
Management Area, and indirect impacts to local road transport.  
 
4.15 Mitigation measures might include:  
 
 • Use of low -emission vehicles and fuels during construction  
 • Onsite infrastructure for charging and fuelling low emission vehicles  
 • Parking management (differenti al rates, priority or dedicated parking for low    
       emission vehicles)  
 • Low emission vehicle or bicycle rental/purchase schemes  123 
  • Car clubs  
 • High quality public transport services  
 
4.16 Some measures to reduce emissions and encourage sustainabl e modes of travel may be designed and built 
into the development.  Other measures are less straightforward and refer to activities and choices made by residents.  
To ensure that the measures included in a Low Emission Assessment and Travel Plan are impleme nted and 
continued in the long -term, the Council may require the applicant to enter into a planning obligation under Section 106 
of The Town and County Planning Act 1990.  The obligation would require the establishment of a management 
company which would a dministrate differential charging levies, rental/purchase schemes or car clubs, as appropriate.   
 
 
Policy DM4 
 
Pollution  
 
Applications for development that risks negatively impacting on the quality of the environment 
through noise, odour, light, air, wate r, land and other forms of pollution must be accompanied by a 
pollution impact assessment and mitigation scheme where necessary.  Development will be permitted 
where the direct, indirect and cumulative effects of pollution will not have an unacceptable neg ative 
impact on health, the natural environment and general amenity.  
 
4.17 When the location or characteristics of a proposed development give rise to concern that the development 
would cause pollution or nuisance to surrounding people, properties or the environment, the Council will require an 
appropriate impact assessment to be undertaken by a suitably qualified person so that the potential effects can be 
properly understood.  This may include cases where the site is already unstable or contaminated due to its former 
use, requiring mitigation or remediation to be carried out so as not to harm the health and wellbeing of future 
occupiers of the development. The Council will also have regard to the River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) and, 
where appropriate, seek to achieve measures which will achieve the objectives of the RBMP and the Water 
Framework Directive (WFD). Under the WFD there should be no deterioration in the status of a water body.  If 
planning permission is granted, a planning condition should be  used to ensure that any mitigation measures set out in 
the assessment are implemented.  
 
4.18 The subject and scope of assessments will vary depending on the scale and type of development being 
proposed.  For instance, where there is concern regarding the effect of additional traffic emissions on nearby 
residential properties, a Low Emission Assessment should include air quality exposure modelling for affected 
properties, and any mitigating measures that would reduce the impact.  In this case the Council wo uld discuss with the 
applicant or agent the level of information required and the methodology to be used.  
 
 - Assessments required under this policy include:  
 - Contamination and subsidence reports  
 - Noise assessments  
 - Low Emission Assessments  
 - Hydrol ogical or drainage reports  
 - Any other technical assessment required to enable sustainable development  124 
 Policy DM5 
 
Parking  
 
Development must provide an appropriate level of parking, taking into account:  
  
a) The accessibility of the site, including the availability of public transport; and  
b) The type, mix and use of development.  
 
Design must enable and encourage the maximum use of sustainable modes of transport, including 
provision for cyclists and low -emission vehicles.  Within the towns of Tiverton, C ullompton and 
Crediton, infrastructure for electric vehicles should be built into development. The Council will seek 
parking provision and electric vehicle infrastructure according to the following standards, the 
variation of which must be justified on a c ase-by-case basis.

4.19 Road transport accounts for over a third of end -user carbon emissions in Mid Devon, at a time when 
European and national policies set increasi ngly challenging targets for reduction of carbon emissions.  However, 
research by the RAC in 2009 showed that, while car usage is reducing, this does not correspond to a reduction in car 
ownership.  Research carried out on behalf of the Department of Commu nities and Local Government in 2007 
forecast an increase of approximately 18% in car ownership between 2001 and 2026.  In view of local levels of car 
ownership and the rural nature of the district, there is clearly a need for development in Mid Devon to pr ovide sufficient 
parking.  
 
4.19a  Policy DM5 applies a minimum residential parking standard of 1.7 spaces per dwelling based on car 
ownership levels in Mid Devon. This figure will be used to calculate the minimum number of parking spaces for the 
whole dev elopment site, with a minimum of one parking space to be allocated for the sole use of each property. The 
remaining parking provision (and more if preferred) should be distributed appropriately throughout the development, in 
accordance with principles set out in the Council’s Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) on the provision of 
parking in new development. Other principles in the SPD should also be adhered to when drawing up development 
proposals, including the allocation of appropriately located motorc ycle, visitor and disabled spaces with sufficient  
manoeuvring space. For developments comprising one or two dwellings the standard will be rounded up to two 
spaces per dwelling. It is always preferential to locate the parking in close proximity to the prop erty it services. For 
houses, car parking should ideally be provided adjacent to the property, either within the residential curtilage or in 
well-designed on -street parking. Spaces within parking courts are much less frequently used, and can be perceived t o 
be inconvenient and insecure. Large, isolated and rear parking courts should be avoided. For non -residential 126 
 development, parking should be provided in accordance with Policy DM5 except where alternative provision can be 
justified on the basis of existin g parking provision or other factors.  
  
4.20 Accepting that people will continue to own cars, there is a need to make the transition to a low carbon 
economy through the promotion of low emission transport.  Policy DM3 also refers t o transport and low emiss ions.  
 127 
 Residential development 
 
Policy DM6  
 
Rural exceptions sites  
 
The development of a site for predominantly affordable or low -cost housing, including self -build 
housing, to meet proven local need in rural areas will be permitted where:  
 
a) There is u p-to-date evidence of housing ne ed secured through a housing need survey or, in the 
case of a self -build proposal, evidence of eligibility for shared ownership housing through ‘Help 
to Buy’ or an equivalent scheme;  
b) Each house will be occupied  by at leas t one person with a strong local connection to the parish;  
c) The site adjoins a settlement and is in a suitable location which takes account of the potential for 
any visual impac t and other relevant planning issues;  
d) The type and scale of affordable or low-cost housing is appropriate to the proven need;  
e) The affordable or low -cost housing will remain affordable for and available to local people in 
perpetuity, limited to no more than 80% of its market value upon resale.  
 
The inclusion of a proportion of  market housing within exception sites will be permitted where the 
proportion of market housing will be less than the provision of affordable or low -cost housing and the 
market housing will be at the lowest level necessary to ensure that the development is  deliverable.  
 
4.22 To encourage the delivery of affordable and low -cost housing in rural areas, exceptions can be made to the 
normal restrictions on housing development outside defined settlements.  Exception sites must adjoin a settlement, 
which for the  purposes of this policy will usually mean one of the settlements defined as suitable for limited 
development in Policy S13.  However, some parishes do not contain a defined settlement but may have an affordable 
housing need, in which case a broader interp retation of ‘settlement’ will be appropriate, as long as there would be 
reasonable access to local services and infrastructure.  Isolated sites in the countryside are not considered 
sustainable locations for new housing even under the exceptions policy.  
 
4.23 Affordable and low -cost housing is reserved for those who cannot afford open market housing and have a 
connection to the local area.  The definition of a ‘local connection’ is kept under review and as such it is appropriate 
that is contained in support ing guidance rather than determined through a Local Plan policy.  In broad terms there 
should be a long -term residential, family or employment connection to the parish where the housing will be located.  
The criteria will be operated in a cascade , approved  by Mid Devon District Council to ensure those with the strongest 
connection are considered first.  A planning obligation will be required to ensure that the affordable or low -cost 
housing remains available for local people in perpetuity.  
 
4.24 Self-build housing will be permitted under this policy where at least one of the occupiers has an established 
housing need, assessed against appropriate officially published criteria.  The Government’s Help to Buy scheme 
applies eligibility criteria.  Successful appl icants:  
 
 • Cannot afford to purchase a home suitable for  their housing needs within a reasonable travelling 
distance of their work place and have a household income  not exceeding £60,000;  
 • Have savings or sufficient funds to pay, if required, a  deposit (which may be 5% or more of the 
purchase price), legal fees, stamp duty and other costs of moving;  
 • Can sustain home ownership in the longer term;  
 • Are not already a home owner or named on a home mortgage;  
 • Have a good credit history.  
 128 
  
4.25 Self-build housing will constitute low -cost housing rather than affordable housing, as it will not be rented 
or part -owned by a housing association.  In the event that the Help to Buy scheme is discontinued or the Council 
identifies a more appropriate way of asses sing eligibility, the Council will consider whether suitable criteria for 
assessing housing need exist elsewhere that can be applied to self -build proposals.  Whilst low -cost housing does not 
meet the definition of affordable housing in terms of tenure, th e Council will require the same controls over the housing 
to ensure that it remains available for people with a local connection who cannot afford open market housing in their 
area.  
 
4.26 Affordable and low -cost housing must be appropriate to the needs of the people occupying it.  For instance, if 
a housing need survey identifies a need for one or two bedroom dwellings, this is what should be provided.  Self -build 
proposals will be tailored to the needs of the applicant, but will be expected to be of a mode st size that reflects the 
principles of affordability for those in housing need.  
  
4.27 National policy allows for some ‘cross -subsidy’ of affordable housing by market housing.  This allows for sites 
which would not otherwise be viable for affordable hous ing to come forward, with market housing limited to the 
minimum level necessary to ensure delivery.  Consistent with the overall principle of exception sites, the proportion of 
affordable housing must always be greater than that of market housing, and deve lopers will be expected to submit 
evidence to demonstrate that the level of market housing proposed is the lowest level needed to deliver significant 
affordable housing.  Evidence of local need for affordable housing will be required, as for any rural exce ption scheme.  
The Council will have regard to any up -to-date local housing need surveys and information from Devon Home Choice.  
 
Policy DM7 
 
Traveller sites  
 
1. Planning applications for Pitches and Plots  
 
Planning applications for gypsy and traveller pitch es, or plots for travelling showpeople, will be 
permitted where:  
 
a) Suitable onsite facilities will be provided including space for children’s play;  
b) The proposal will have suitable environmental quality for residents including non -isolating 
boundary tr eatments; and  
c) The site will not cause unacceptable landscape or ecological impact and is not located in an area 
at high risk of flooding;  
d) Occupation will be limited to those who meet the Government’s published definition of gypsi es 
and travellers, in cluding travelling showpeople  or their dependents; and  
e) Safe and convenient access to local facilities is provided . 
 
Sites with associated employment or storage elements will be permitted where there is specific 
justification and the location , scale, and  nature  of the proposed development will not have harmful 
impacts on local amenity or the local environment.  Gypsy and traveller accommodation may be 
included as part of the affordable housing requirement.  
 
2. Provision on allocated sites  
 
Gypsy and Travell er pitches on allocated sites (sought by Policies TIV1, CU1, CU7 or CRE5) 
should be provided on site unless it is demonstrated that off -site provision will achieve a n 
acceptable  outcome for Gypsies and Travellers taking into account:  
 129 
 i) Pitch numbers  
ii) Site fa cilities;  
iii) Accessibility to services, including health and education;  
iv) Early delivery of serviced pitches or plots which are available for occupation; and  
v) The provision of an effective mechanism for delivery.  
 
Such sites must also meet the requirements of Pa rt 1 of Policy DM7 above.   
 
4.28 To ensure that sites will meet the needs of the travelling communities and the settled community a criteria 
based policy will be operated as set out above to determine applications for traveller sites. In order to ensure t hat 
users of sites will have access to facilities, national policy indicates that local planning authorities should very strictly  
limit new traveller site development in countryside that is away from existing settlements or outside allocations in the 
devel opment plan.  Sites will therefore only be permitted where facilities will be accessible without recourse to a car 
either by walking, cycling or utilising public transport. However, sites must also be in locations where the local 
environment is of satisfac tory quality, so locations adjacent to noisy or polluting land uses or in areas of floodplain will 
not be suitable.  
 
4.29  There is a need for 35 new pitches for gypsies and travellers for the period 2014 -34, and 11 plots for travelling 
showpeople for the period 2014 -34. The majority of this need is proposed to be met on the largest  allocated 
developments at Tiverton Eastern Urban Extension, North -West and East Cullompton, and Pedlerspool in Crediton. 
Pitches must be provided on -site unless the acceptable  outcome described by Policy DM7 is demonstrated. Any 
proposals for acceptable  off-side provision must identify and provide serviced sites in accordance with Policy DM7. A 
clear mechanism to ensure that pitches or plots are delivered in such a way as to achi eve a n acceptable outcome for 
the travelling community must be identified. This will usually be through a s106 agreement requiring the developer to 
identify and obtain planning permission (which will not be unreasonably withheld by the Council) for the req uired 
number and standard of pitches. The pitches will be provided by the development itself or where the land is 
transferred for a nominal value, by an agreed third party Registered Provider or other agreed private provider, for the 
sole purpose of occupa tion and ancillary business by Gypsies and Travellers. The off -site provision of pitches must be 
provided and made available for occupation before the occupation of a specified proportion of the provision of on -site 
open market dwellings as part of the lar ger housing proposal at TIV1, CU1, CU7 or CRE5.  Where gypsy and traveller 
pitches are provided on- or off -site on housing allocations, these are to be counted against the affordable housing 
targets for that site .  
 
 
Policy DM8 
 
Rural workers’ dwellings  
 
Applications for rural workers’ dwellings will be permitted where:  
 
a) It can be demonstrated that the nature and demands of an existing rural business are such  that a 
full time worker has an essential need to be permanently resident at or near their plac e of work so 
they are available at most times;  
b) The need cannot be met within a nearby settlement, or by existing housing at or near the site or 
through the conversion of a suitable redundant or disused rural building at the site;  
c) The size and scale of rural workers dwellings will be commensurate with the scale of the 
operation and designed to reflect the location and setting of the proposed site; and  
d) The rural enterprise has been established for at least three years, is currently financially sound , 
and has a clear prospect of remaining so.  
 
Where a rural business is not yet established a mobile home may be permitted for a temporary period, 
on the basis of criteria b) and c) above, and evidence of:  130 
  
 (i) An essential need for one or more workers to be readily  available at most times  
 (ii) A firm intention and ability to develop the enterprise  
 (iii) Sound financial planning  
 
Permissions for rural workers dwellings will be subject to an occupancy condition. Removal of such a 
condition will only be per mitted where there is clear evidence that there is no need for the condition to 
remain in place.  
 
4.30 With the majority of Mid Devon’s population living outside its main towns the contribution of rural areas is a 
very important part of the district’s over all economy. Therefore, it is important that the Council’s planning policies 
support rural enterprises. To promote sustainable patterns of development rural workers will usually be expected to 
find housing in existing rural communities. However, an excepti on to this approach can be justified where it can be 
shown that a rural worker has an essential need to be available at most times as part of the operation of a rural 
business in accord with national policy.  Essential need means a specific management acti vity or combination of 
activities which require the ready presence of a worker at most times if the proper functioning of an enterprise is not to 
be prejudiced and which cannot be achieved by any other practical means such as electronic surveillance. Such need 
would relate to any particular event or combination of events that could lead to adverse animal welfare, crop or 
product quality, or health and safety consequences which might threaten the stability and economic well -being of an 
enterprise. In all cas es, these would be events which could not be properly managed within normal working hours.  
Security concerns on their own will not be sufficient to justify a new dwelling. On working family farms, the Council 
recognises that retired farmers may continue t o live on the farm and there could be a need for additional 
accommodation to meet the needs of the next generation. In these cases the existing dwelling will not be treated as 
available alternative accommodation pursuant to criterion b) of the policy, thou gh the Council may require a Section 
106 Agreement (planning obligation) to ensure the existing dwelling remains occupied by agricultural workers.  
 
4.31 Applications for rural workers’ dwellings will need to be accompanied by evidence which conclusively 
demonstrates the essential nature of the need and that suitable accommodation can only be provided through the 
construction of a new dwelling. In order for such dwellings to remain affordable for rural workers and to protect the 
intrinsic beauty of the count ryside proposed dwellings will need to be of a size which matches the scale of the 
operation and other buildings on the site.  As such development will take place in areas where the development of 
new houses would not normally be permitted, it will also be  important to ensure that its design reflects its immediate 
context and its wider rural setting.  Permitted development rights may be removed to prevent further enlargement of 
the dwelling without planning permission, to keep the dwelling at a size and val ue that will be affordable for rural 
workers.  
 
4.32 Where a rural business is not yet established, the Council will consider granting a temporary mobile home, 
subject to appropriate evidence of essential need, a firm intention to develop the enterprise and  sound financial 
planning. A ‘firm intention’ and sound financial planning might be demonstrated by a combination of measures such as 
the construction of new buildings; the purchase of stock needed to operate a rural business; appropriate agricultural or 
rural business training and qualifications; work experience; and evidence of sufficient finances to establish the 
enterprise.  
 
4.33 Consent is granted for rural workers’ dwellings as an exception to normal policy to support the rural economy. 
Therefore such  planning permissions will be made subject to an occupancy condition which ensures the dwelling 
remains tied to the agricultural or other appropriate occupational use and is not sold or rented to unsuitable occupants. 
To prevent abuse of the exception for rural workers dwellings the removal of such conditions will need strong evidence 
to show that the occupancy by a rural worker is no longer justified, such as evidence of marketing at an appropriate 
price for a period of at least 18 months and an assessment  of the demand for rural dwellings in the area.  
 
4.34 In appropriate circumstances the Council will also seek Section 106 Agreements to ensure that a temporary 
dwelling is not put in place until associated development or infrastructure has been completed, and to tie the rural 
workers’ dwelling to the operation and associated land which has the essential need to prevent the splitting of the 
dwelling from the operation.  131 
  
Policy DM9  
 
Conversion of rural buildings  
 
The conversion of redundant or disused rural buildings of substantial and permanent construction 
which positively contribute to an area’s rural character for residential, tourism or employment uses 
will be permitted where:  
 
a) A suitable access to the building is in place or can be created without da maging the surrounding 
area’s rural character and the road network can support the proposed use;  
b) The building can be converted without significant alteration, extension  or rebuilding;  
c) The design will retain the original character of the building and its surroundings; and  
d) The development will retain any nature conservation interest associated with the site or building, 
and provide net gains in biodiversity where possible.  
 
4.35 The buildings within Mid Devon’s countryside are an essential part of it s character and when they become 
redundant or disused they can provide a useful resource to allow the delivery of sustainable economic or residential 
development. In many cases the conversion of a rural building to an alternative use will be permitted deve lopment, 
requiring only a prior notification to the Local Planning Authority rather than a full planning application.  However, if the  
relevant criteria for permitted development do not apply, planning permission is still required and it is important to 
ensure that such conversions take into account their rural setting and the need to deliver good design.  
 
4.36 National policy supports the sustainable re -use of rural buildings for economic and residential uses, requiring 
development to be sustainable and re cognise the intrinsic beauty of the countryside.  Development must be well 
designed and achieve a good standard of amenity for all existing and future occupants of land and buildings. 
Specifically in relation to residential conversions national policy stat es that they should lead to an enhancement to the 
immediate setting.  
 
4.37 To ensure a conversion does not have a detrimental impact on the countryside and is sustainable, it is 
important that its development does not involve works that will have a harmfu l impact.  The building should retain its 
original character in order that the converted building continues to positively contribute to the area’s rural character.  It  
is therefore important that any changes to the buildings are kept to a minimum, as refle cted in the policy.  Negative 
impacts could include the creation of a new access across an open field or light pollution in areas away from existing 
development. In order to ensure highway safety it is also important that a suitable access can be provided and the 
road network can support the proposed use. The rural nature of Mid Devon’s highway network means that traffic 
intensive uses such as distribution or the movement of heavy and or bulky goods will not be appropriate in many 
locations. Further, rural buildings’ role in the character of the countryside means that buildings in a ruinous state 
should not be re -used, the visual impact of the converted building should be no greater than that of the original 
building and local vernacular architecture should be retained.  The Council will require a structural survey to be 
submitted to demonstrate that the building can be converted without significant alteration, extension or rebuilding, and 
may impose a planning condition which restricts permitted development rights for subsequent extensions and 
alterations.  
 
4.38 Redundant rural buildings often serve as bat roosts or habitats for other protected species.  The Countryside 
and Rights of Way Act 2000, the UK Biodiversity Action Plan and a number of other Regulati ons and Directives 
designate ‘protected species’ with legal protection.  It is an offence recklessly or deliberately to kill, injure, capture or  
disturb protected species, which includes carrying out works which obstruct, damage or destroy access to that 
species’ habitat.  The Council will require a habitat survey to accompany any planning application for the conversion of 
a rural building, to identify protected species within the application site, set out any mitigation measures where 
appropriate and inclu de recommendations for the enhancement of biodiversity.  
 132 
 4.38a  Policy DM9 refers to the conversion of existing buildings to a residential, tourism or  employment use. 
Proposals for new -build employment and expansion of existing businesses  will be assessed against DM18. Other 
policies in the Local Plan will also be applied as  appropriate.  
 
 
Policy DM10  
 
Replacement dwellings in rural areas  
 
The construction of replacement dwellings outside defined settlement limits will be permitted where 
the replacement dwe lling’s floorspace will be no greater in size than the existing dwelling, taking into 
account any unspent permitted development rights.  
 
4.39 Situations can arise where a replacement dwelling is sought because the cost of repairing or altering an 
existing building exceeds the cost of its total replacement. As the principle of development is established by the 
existing dwelling its replacement will generally be acceptable. However, to ensure that the character and amenity of 
the area are not harmed, and the rural dwelling stock remains affordable for local residents, the size of the new 
dwelling should be restricted to that of the previous dwelling except where there are any unspent permitted 
development rights. In all circumstances, the permitted development  rights for the replacement dwelling will be 
removed. The relocation of a building within a plot will generally be acceptable provided it is in keeping with the 
placement of nearby houses in their plot.  Policy DM10 refers to the replacement of existing dw ellings, the use of 
which has not been abandoned.   
 
 
Policy DM11 
 
Residential extensions and ancillary development  
 
Extensions to existing dwellings and other ancillary development will be permitted provided that they:  
 
a)   Respect the character, scale,  setting and design of existing dwelling s;  
b)   Will not result in over -development of the dwelling curtilage; and  
c)   Will not have a significantly adverse impact on the living conditions of  occupants of 
neighbouring properties.  
 
4.40 Rather than mov ing house to gain extra space many people extend their existing property and permitted 
development rights allow many extensions to be built without the need to apply for planning permission.  However, 
there are still situations where planning permission is  required and where extensions needing planning permission are 
proposed.  It is important that the design of the extension is suitable for the building it will extend and for its immediate  
surroundings.  For example it would not be acceptable for an extens ion to dominate the existing dwelling or to block 
light into principal rooms in an adjacent dwelling.  The living conditions of neighbours should not be significantly 
harmed, and the Council will have regard to a number of factors affecting living conditio ns, such as light, privacy and 
overbearing or over -dominating effects. However, there is no right to a view across someone else’s land, so the loss 
of a view will not in itself be a reason for refusal of planning permission. There are also occasions where ancillary 
development to a dwelling may need planning permission and in such cases it will also be important to ensure that the 
design and location of ancillary development is acceptable.

Policy DM14  
 
Town centre developm ent  
 
The Council will promote the sustainable growth and regeneration of Ti verton, Cullompton and 
Crediton .  Within defined town centres, development proposals for main town centre uses, community 
and residential development will be supported where they:  
 
a) Retain or enhance the town centre’s historic character and appearance, vitality and viability;  
b) Sustain or enhance diverse town centre uses and customer choice, incorporating residential 
accommodation above ground floor level where possible; and  
c) Are readily accessible by public transport, walking and cycling.  
 
Within defined primary shopping areas, the shopping function will be safeguarded and enhanced.  
Development and change of use of ground floor premises to alternative uses will not be permitt ed 
where:   
  
 i) The primary retail role and character is undermined, causing unacceptable fragmentation and 
isolation of the remaining shops;  
 ii) The proposed use would harm the vitality and viability of the primary shopping area; and  
 iii) There would be a detrimental effect on the visual character and amenities of the surrounding 
area.  
 
Within primary shopping frontages, at ground floor level the proportion of A1, A2 and A3 uses will not 
be permitted to fall below 85% of all units . 
 
4.44 The town centr e is at the heart of a market town’s community.  The Local Plan distributes development 
according to the location, role and function of the towns of Tiverton, Cullompton and Crediton, with Cullompton 
expected to expand considerably over the plan period.  O ther Local Plan policies will also apply as appropriate, such 
as Policy DM1 on high quality design.  
 
4.45 Retail markets change quickly and it is important that local planning policies are flexible enough to respond to 
rapid change.  For this reason, Polic y DM14 sets out a wide range of permissible uses in town centres, seeking to 
diversify customer choice while protecting and enhancing the viability of the town centre, its historic character and its 
accessibility by the most sustainable modes of transport.   This applies to change of use applications as well as new -
build development.  
 
4.46 Primary shopping frontages have been defined within Tiverton and Crediton town centres, showing where 
retail development is concentrated.  The primary shopping frontage ( identified on the Policies Map) should include a 
high proportion of retail uses which may include food, drinks, clothing and household goods.  These are the core town 
centre retail uses and should be protected, while other uses such as takeaways and profes sional services may be 
located elsewhere in the town centre.   
 
4.47 Planning applications within the primary shopping areas will be not be permitted if any of criteria i -iii of Policy 
DM14 apply.  The assessment of such applications will include considera tion of:  
 
 • The location and prominence of the pr emises within the shopping frontage  
 • The floorspace and length of frontage of the premises  134 
  • The number, distribution and proximity to  other premises within use classes A2 -A5, or within planning 
permissi ons for such use  
 • The particular nature and character of the u se proposed, including the level of pedestrian activity 
associated with it  
 • The level of vacancies in ground floor properties  
 • Whether the proposed use would give ris e to noise, smell or o ther environmental problems  
 
 
Policy DM15 
 
Development outside town centres  
 
Within Tiverton, Cullompton and Crediton , the Council will apply a sequential approach to planning 
applications for main town centre uses, according to the following descending o rder of preference:  
 
a) Town centre  
b) Edge of town centre  
c) Out of town centre  
 
Edge of centre and other out of centre proposals must be well related to the town centre and 
accessible by public transport, walking or cycling.  Proposals in these locations  must also 
demonstrate that no suitable sites are available in a more sustainable location according to the order 
of preference given above.  
  
The Council will require an impact assessment to be submitted for any proposals for retail , leisure 
and office development outside of town centres, where the total  gross floorspace would exceed 500 
square metres.  The impact assessment must include an assessment of:  
 
 i) The impact of the proposal on existing, committed and planned public and private investment 
in the town or other centres in the catchment area of the proposal; and  
 ii) The impact of the proposal on town centre vitality and viability, including local consumer 
choice and trade in the town centre and wider area, up to five years from the time the appli cation 
is made, or ten years in the case of major development, taking into account the cumulative impact 
of recently completed developments, planning permissions and development plan allocations.   
 
4.48 National policy requires local authorities to apply a sequential approach to main town centre uses, to ensure 
the vitality and viability of town centres are not harmed by out -of-centre development.  A proportionate, locally set 
threshold may be applied to retail, leisure and office floorspace proposed outsi de of town centres, over which an 
impact assessment should be required.  The Mid Devon Retail Study recommends a threshold of 500 square metres 
gross floorspace.  The need for an impact assessment will be considered in the context of each application and w ill be 
required where the development will result in total gross floorspace of over 500 square metres, either itself or 
cumulatively with other existing or proposed development of a similar type.  
 
4.49 In considering development proposals in edge of centre  or out of centre locations, the Council will assess 
whether there are suitable sites in a more sustainable location according to the order of preference and apply a 
flexible approach where justified.  The nature, scale, car parking requirements and market  demands of the proposal 
will be taken into account.  
 
4.50 National policy defines ‘edge of centre’ as follows:  
 
For retail purposes, a location that is well connected and up to 300 metres of the primary shopping area.  For all other 
main town centre uses,  a location within 300 metres of a town centre boundary.  For office development, this includes 135 
 locations outside the town centre but within 500 metres of a public transport interchange.  In determining whether a 
site falls within the definition of edge of  centre, account should be taken of local circumstances.  
 
4.51 A retail impact assessment submitted in accordance with Policy DM15 should have regard to the findings of 
the Retail Study 2012. The assessment should consider the effect on existing stores an d centres of committed and 
allocated developments and the development being proposed, based on:  
 
 (i) the turnover of existing facilities in the catchment area (including any completed   
 since the Retail Study 2012)  
 (ii)  the expected trade diversion fro m these facilities to any retail sites under construction, with planning 
permission or allocated for development  
 (iii) the trade diversion resulting from the proposed development  
 
Applications for leisure development over 500 square metres floorspace shou ld use a similar approach based on the 
Tourism Study and any other appropriate evidence.  
 
4.51a  Where specific allocations of this plan contain proposals for uses which are subject to the  sequential test, a 
proportionate approach to the application of the test will be required, reflecting  the strategic decisions already made 
through the local plan process. However, the local planning  authority will still fully consider the potential impact on 
town centre vitality and viability to ensure  that the primary rol e of the town centres in meeting such development 
needs is maintained.  
 
4.51b  Where proposals are predicted to have a likely adverse impact (including cumulative) on town centre health, 
planning permission should be refused. The Mid Devon Retail and Touris m Studies are available on the Mid Devon 
District Council website.  
 
 
Policy DM16 
 
Fronts of shops and business premises  
 
Proposals for the alteration, replacement or construction of fronts for shops or business premises must be 
well proportioned and suited  to the character of the building, adjacent buildings and the surrounding street 
scene.  Where security measures such as grilles or shutters are proposed, these should be designed as an 
integral part of the building’s front, maintaining the visibility of t he building’s interior and minimising visual 
impact.  Independent ground floor access to the upper floors must be retained.    
 
4.52 The fronts of shops and business premises visually dominate town centres and have a considerable impact 
on the town centre’ s character and appearance.  Attractive shop fronts that respect their surroundings have a positive 
effect on the overall quality and attractiveness of a town centre.  This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy 
DM1 on high quality design and Pol icy DM25 on heritage assets.   
 
4.53 National policy emphasises the importance of residential development in bolstering the vitality of town 
centres.  Policy DM14 therefore promotes residential development in town centres where possible, and Policy DM16 
supports this further by ensuring that access to accommodation above ground floor commercial units is not lost 
through redevelopment of the building’s ground floor front.   
 
4.54 Advertisements including fascia and projecting signs often go hand -in-hand with  the design of shop fronts and 
other business premises.   Applications for Advertisement Consent are determined outside of the Development Plan, 
under the ‘Control of Advertisements’ regulations.  Such applications are determined on the basis of public ame nity 
and highway safety.  National policy provides additional guidance.  
 136 
  
Policy DM17  
 
Rural shopping  
 
Retail development will be permitted within defined villages, where it will meet local needs and is 
accessible by a range of transport modes. Adjacent to  defined villages and elsewhere in the open 
countryside, proposals for retail development must demonstrate that:  
 
a) The location and scale of the development wo uld not harm the vitality and viability of town centre 
or village shopping  facilities;  
b) The d evelopment would not lead to an unacceptable impact on the local road network; and  
c) There would not be an unacceptable adverse impact to the character and appearance of the 
countryside.  
 
4.55 Policy S13 defines the villages in Mid Devon that are conside red suitable for limited growth, due to their 
physical characteristics and the availability of a range of facilities and services.   The Council supports the sustainable 
growth and expansion of business and enterprise in rural areas, while protecting the p redominance of town centres for 
meeting the district’s retail needs.  Policy DM17 refers only to retail development, while Policy DM18 will be applied to 
non-retail business development.  Policy DM1 (high quality design) also applies.   
 
 
Policy DM18  
 
Rura l employment development  
 
In countryside locations, planning permission will be granted for new -build employment 
development or expansion of existing businesses, provided that the development is of an 
appropriate use and scale for its location. Proposals must demonstrate that:  
 
a) The development would not lead to an una cceptable impact on the local road network;  
b) There would not be an unacceptable adverse impact to the character and appearance of the 
countryside; and  
c) There are insufficient suitabl e sites or premises in the immediate area to meet the needs of the 
proposal.  
 
4.56 The Council recognises the importance of retaining and providing rural employment opportunities outside 
settlement limits as a means of ensuring a diverse and healthy rural economy.  There is a range of employment 
activities, particularly those associated with tourism, recreation and rural diversification that can be accommodated in 
countryside locations, without any adverse effects upon the character of Mid Devon’s rural are as or existing 
development.  It is important that the various indirect consequences of employment development such as security 
fencing, lighting, advertising material, open storage and vehicle parking and manoeuvring provisions do not harm the 
visual envir onment. It is also important that development outside settlement limits only occurs where there are 
insufficient alternatives available otherwise such development would not be sustainable. The policy is not intended to 
relate to large scale strategic devel opment which would be contrary to Policy S2.  
 
4.57 Policy DM18 refers to new -build developments and expansion of existing businesses.  Proposals for 
conversion of existing buildings to an employment use will be assessed against Policy DM9.  Other policies in the 
Local Plan will also be applied as appropriate.  
 137 
  
Policy DM19  
 
Protection of employment land  
 
Non-employment use or development of employment land or buildings, including sites that are 
established, allocated or have planning permission, will be per mitted where it can be demonstrated 
that there is no reasonable prospect of the site being used for employment purposes.  Alternative 
uses will be permitted where it is demonstrated that:  
 
a) Firstly, there is a sufficient range of suitable and available e mployment  sites in the local area; 
then  
b) There is no commercial interest in the re -use of the site for employment, demonstrated by suitable 
marketing at an appropriate price for at least  18 months . 
 
4.58 One of the Council’s five key objectives is a thr iving economy.  The Local Plan allocates commercial land 
sufficient to meet the district’s future needs to 2033, but many people in the district will continue to commute to other 
areas and it is important to protect the sites that are currently providing j obs in Mid Devon.  Employment land is a 
scarce and valuable resource which needs to be retained to ensure that the Council can deliver one of its key 
objectives.  
 
4.59 National planning policy discourages the long -term protection of allocated employment si tes where there is no 
reasonable prospect of a site being used for that purpose, and requires local planning authorities to have regard to 
market signals.  Policy DM19 sets out local requirements that help to establish whether individual sites can provide 
employment.  In assessing the range of suitable and available alternative employment sites in the local area (criterion 
a), the Council will have regard to the specific and wider conclusions of the Employment Land Review (2013), which 
describes a shortage in small employment allocations in Mid Devon.  For the purposes of Policy DM19, the ‘local area’ 
means the Mid Devon district and, if an application site is in a parish adjacent to the district’s boundary, a 
neighbouring district.  
 
4.60 Applicants will als o be required to demonstrate that there is no commercial interest in the re -use of the site for 
employment purposes.  In view of the on -going fluctuations in the national economy, an 18 month marketing period is 
considered appropriate and will be kept unde r review in subsequent local plans.  In relation to the appropriate price 
referred to in criterion (c) the price should reflect the price of similar employment sites or buildings which have been 
marketed within the previous two years or result from an inde pendent assessment of the value of the land or buildings 
where this is not feasible . 
 
 
Policy DM20 
 
Agricultural development  
 
Agricultural development will be permitted where:  
 
a)  The development is reasonably necessary to support farming activity on  that farm or in the 
immediate agricultural community;  
b)  The development is sensitively located to limit any adverse effects on the living conditions of 
local residents and is well -designed, respecting the character and appearance of the area;  
c) The develop ment will not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the  environment; and  
d) The development will not have an unacceptable traffic impact on the local road network.  138 
  
4.61 Agriculture is an important element of the Mid Devon economy. Agricultural developm ent is essential to 
support modern farming and ensure a sustainable rural economy.  This policy permits new agricultural development 
outside of the defined settlements, whilst seeking to balance the needs of modern farming with protecting the 
countryside a nd residential amenity.  
 
4.62 Proposals for the development of new buildings for livestock need to take account of waste product storage or 
removal, and the effect this can have on the amenity of local residents and the environment. Such proposals will nee d 
to be accompanied by a Waste Management Plan, which sets out how the development limits any adverse effects.  
Where the development is likely to cause demonstrable harm to the environment, for instance where drainage from 
the site threatens the ecologica l integrity of a water body, a hydrological or drainage report will be required in 
accordance with Policy DM4 (pollution).  A planning condition may be imposed to ensure that appropriate mitigation 
measures are implemented.  
 
 
Policy DM21 
 
Equestrian develo pment  
 
Horse -related facilities and equestrian enterprises in the countryside will be permitted where they are 
well integrated with their surroundings, being of appropriate location, scale, design and materials so 
as not to harm the character and landscap e of the rural area or the amenity of nearby residents.  
 
Equestrian development must not result in an unacceptable increase in traffic on the local highway 
network.  
 
4.63 The use of land for horse keeping is a common feature of the Mid Devon landscape.  Eq uine activities are an 
established part of the rural economy, providing opportunities for recreation and employment.  Equestrian activities 
are typically located in the open countryside, away from settlements, where most forms of development are restricted .    
 
4.64 New equine facilities can have a negative impact on the rural nature of an area, adversely affecting landscape 
character and natural beauty, by their appearance, scale, materials or design.  Individually, equestrian developments 
may seem inconse quential, but cumulatively they may, over time, significantly alter the character of an area.  It is 
therefore important that any new developments are designed and located as to minimise their impact, taking account 
of local character and landscape.  Where  proposals are part of an existing agricultural development, any new facilities 
should be integrated with, or located near to existing farm buildings or structures.  
 
4.65 Commercial establishments or large scale domestic operations including racing stables , horse riding centres 
and liveries will have a greater impact on a local area, through their size, associated traffic generation and greater use 
of local roads for exercising of horses.  Such establishments should demonstrate how they will not result in a n 
unacceptable increase in traffic on local roads.  
 
  139 
  
Policy DM22 
 
Tourism and leisure development  
 
Proposals for new or expanded tourism, visitor or leisure facilities will be supported within or 
adjacent to defined settlements.  Elsewhere, the nature of  the proposed development must justify a 
countryside location and minimise environmental impacts, avoiding an unacceptable traffic impact on 
the local road network.  Development proposals must:  
 
a) Respect the character and appearance of the location;  
b) Where appropriate, involve conversi on or replacement of existing buildings; and  
c) Demonstrate that the need is not met by existing provision within nearby settlements.  
 
4.66 Tourism plays an important role in generating income for local residents.  Devon is a very popular tourist 
destination, providing leisure and recreation activities for its own residents and those visiting the county.  Despite a 
number of small scale attractions and places to stay across Mid Devon, tourism is less developed than within other 
parts of the county, partly reflecting the district’s inland location and distance to the coast.  
 
4.67 Tourism and leisure development is generally welcomed, providing employment and a means of 
supplementing rural incomes.  However, it can have nega tive impacts on the surrounding area if located insensitively, 
being out of scale with its context or by failing to take account of local character and appearance.  The policy seeks to 
locate most development within or close to defined settlements, where l ocal shops and facilities are most accessible 
and stand to benefit the most. Sustainable development will be approved in accordance with Policy S1.  
 
4.68 Applications for tourism and leisure development in the countryside will need to be justified by the applicant.  
The Council will require a marketing strategy and business plan to be submitted, to explain how the development will 
achieve a high quality tourism product that meets demand.  Proposals must demonstrate that their benefits outweigh 
any harm and  that they do not cause an unacceptable impact to traffic on the local road network.  Tourism and leisure 
development should benefit local businesses, the environment, communities and visitors in the long -term, so the 
Council will seek the right form of de velopment in the right location, with evidence that the need is not already being 
met by existing provision.  In demonstrating unmet need for tourism proposals outside settlement limits, applicants 
should have regard to the Council’s Tourism Study, availab le on the Mid Devon District Council website.   
 
4.69 Evidence supporting a countryside location should be proportionate to the scale and nature of the tourism 
proposal being considered.  For instance, the conversion of a barn to tourist accommodation is p ermissible in principle 
under Policy DM9 (conversion of rural buildings) and is often dependent on an agricultural character which would not 
be found in a nearby town or village. Larger tourism attractions such as animal sanctuaries, museums, outdoor activ ity 
centres or hotels may have a significant impact on the countryside and the local road network, so in these cases more 
comprehensive supporting evidence will be required.  
 
  140 
 Community facilities 
 
Policy DM23 
 
Community facilities  
 
The development of n ew community facilities providing a local community benefit or environmental 
enhancement will be permitted where they are easily accessible by the local community and well 
related to a settlement.   Proposals for the redevelopment of existing community fac ilities that enables 
them to modernise, remain viable and continue to be retained for the benefit of the community will be 
supported.   
 
Proposals involving the loss of community facilities such as local shops, public houses, allotments, 
cultural and recre ational facilities and other important local services will not be permitted where this 
would damage the settlement’s ability to meet its day to day needs or result in the total loss of such 
services to the community.  Only in circumstances where the facili ty is proven to be no longer 
economically viable, including for alternative community uses, will applications for alternative use be 
considered acceptable.   
 
4.70 Community facilities provide for the health and wellbeing, social, educational, spiritual, r ecreational, leisure 
and cultural needs of the community. They include pubs, post offices, shops, village halls, allotments, places of 
worship and various recreational facilities. National policy seeks to retain and develop local services and community 
facilities and guard against their unnecessary loss, while the vision for this Local Plan recognises the importance of 
providing safe, healthy and crime free neighbourhoods .  Policy DM23 therefore builds on this guidance and seeks to 
protect those existing se rvices whilst permitting some redevelopment where it is necessary to ensure viability.  
 
4.71 The Council will guard against the unnecessary loss of valued community facilities and services.  In 
circumstances where a community facility is proved to be no lo nger economically viable in a particular location, the 
Council will consider an alternative use.   Assessment of viability will require the submission of detailed evidence 
relating to trading accounts, valuation considerations and the marketing of the busi ness or property at a reasonable 
price for a minimum of 12 months.  
 
4.72 Local communities can nominate buildings as ‘assets of community value’ to be added to a register held by 
the Council.  Once on the register the owners of a facility will need to noti fy the Council if they intend to sell the asset, 
at which point the community will be offered the opportunity to purchase it.  Mid Devon District Council will compile this 
list as community assets are brought forward.  Applicants should contact the Council  for further advice should they 
wish to apply for planning permission or change of use on a community facility that has been included on the register.  
The Council cannot refuse planning permission purely on the basis that a community asset is on the regis ter.   
 141 
 Policy DM24 
 
Protection of Local Green Space and recreational land/buildings  
 
Open space, sports and recreational buildings and land, including playing fields, will be protected 
from alternative development unless:  
 
a) An assessment has been under taken which demonstrates that the site is surplus to requirements, 
including requirements within the parish for alternative forms of open space, sports or 
recreational use; or  
b) The loss resulting from the proposed development would be replaced by equival ent or better 
provision in terms of quant ity and quality in a suitable location, prior to the commencement of the 
development; or  
c) The development is for alternative sports and recreational provision, the needs for which clearly 
outweigh the loss.  
 
Desig nated areas of Local Green Space will be protected from development unless the development 
meets the criteria set out in national policy for the protection of Green Belts.  
  
4.73 This policy aims to protect open space, sport and recreational land or buildi ngs from redevelopment, with the 
exception of any sites allocated for alternative use.   
 
4.74 The Open Space and Play Area Strategy (2014) identifies sites of public open space, sports and recreational 
land in the district. Where the strategy shows a surp lus of play areas or other open space according to the standards 
set out in Policy S5, the Council will consider which open spaces are most important for long -term maintenance and 
retention. Those which include a flexible mix of uses such as equipped play space, sports and informal recreation land 
will normally be considered a priority for retention, and also those which are an integral and well -functioning part of an 
existing housing estate. Proposals for redevelopment of surplus open space must demonstrat e that the site is less 
preferable for public recreational use than the alternative open spaces within an accessible distance of the 
development.  If this is not the case, criteria b) or c) of the policy apply.  
 
4.75 Sites which are particularly important to local communities may be designated as Local Green Space, through 
the preparation of local or neighbourhood plans. The Local Plan designates Local Green Space at the following 
locations:  
 
 • Millennium Green, Bampton  
 • Joan’s Orchard, Bickleigh  
 • Recr eatio n Ground, Bickleigh  
 • Nick’s Farm Field, Bradninch  
 • Millennium  Green, Sandford  
 • Millennium Green, Thorverton  
 • Sports Field, Witheridge  
 
4.76 Neighbourhood plans produced by local communities may designate further areas in addition to the above list.  
Local Green Space must be reasonably close to the community it serves; have demonstrable local significance and 
interest; be local in character and not cover an extensive tract of land.  National policy applies a level of protection 
equivalent to Gr een Belts.  
 142 
 Environment  
 
Policy DM25 
 
Development affecting heritage assets  
 
Heritage assets and their settings are an irreplaceable resource.  Accordingly the Council will:  
 
a) Apply a presumption in favour of  preserving or enhancing all designated  herit age assets  and their 
settings ; 
b) Require development proposals likely to affect  the significance of  heritage assets, including new 
buildings, alterations, extensions, changes of use and demolitions, to consider their significance, 
character, setting  (including views to or from), appearance, design, layout and local 
distinctiveness, and the opportunities to enhance them;  
c) Only approve proposals that would lead to substantial harm or total loss of significance of a 
designated heritage asset where it can be  demonstrated that the substantial harm or loss is 
necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh that harm or loss or the 
requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework are met;  
d) Where a development proposal will lead to less tha n substantial harm  to the significance of a 
designated heritage asset, this  harm  should  be weighed against  the public benefits of the 
proposal , including securing  its optimum viable use; and  
e) Require developers to make a proportionate but systematic ass essment of  any impact on the 
setting  and thereby the significance of heritage asset(s) .   
 
4.77 The historic environment is an asset of great cultural, social, economic and environmental value.  It is a non -
renewable resource that contributes significantly  to our quality of life and to the character of the district.  Heritage 
assets are defined as those parts of the historic environment that have significance because of their historic, 
archaeological, architectural or artistic interest over and above their functional utility and covers both designated and 
non-designated assets.   
 
4.78 A heritage asset is defined as a building, monument, site, place, area or landscape identified as having a 
degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions because of its heritage interest.  This includes 
designated heritage assets such as listed buildings, scheduled monuments, registered parks and gardens and 
conservation areas, and undesignated sites that can include archaeological sites, locally listed ass ets and any asset 
included on the Devon County Historic Environment Record.   
 
4.79 Where proposed development will have the potential to impact upon a heritage asset or its setting, the 
Council will require the applicant to submit sufficient information t o enable a description of a heritage asset affected 
and a consideration of the impact of the development upon it.  This may take the form of an appropriately detailed 
desk -based assessment and, where necessary, a field evaluation.  The level of detail requ ired should be proportionate 
to the asset’s importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on its 
significance.  If physical preservation of a heritage asset in situ is not appropriate or feasible, “preservatio n by record” 
may be acceptable and implementation required by a condition attached to planning permission.  Non -designated 
heritage assets of archaeological interest that are of equivalent significance to a scheduled monument, will be 
considered subject to  the policies for designated heritage assets.  
 
4.80 Proposed development that would lead to substantial harm or total loss of significance of a designated 
heritage asset will be assessed against national policy, which requires that such proposals should be  refused unless 
there are substantial public benefits that outweigh the harm, or all of the following considerations apply:  
 
 • The nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site  143 
  • No suitable viable use of the heritage asset can be  found in the medium term    
 through appropriate marketing  
 • There is no possibility of conservation as a result of grant -funding or charitable or public ownership  
 • The harm or loss would be outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site  back into use  
 
4.81 Balancing the importance of conservation with the challenge of tackling climate change represents a priority 
for the district. Proposals for measures to mitigate the effects of climate change that affect listed buildings or buildings 
in a conservatio n area can sometimes conflict negatively with the principles of conservation.  Therefore prior to 
determination, the Council will work with applicants to identify feasible solutions that deliver climate change mitigation 
with less or no harm to the signifi cance or setting of the heritage asset.  Where conflict is unavoidable, the public 
benefit of mitigating the effects of climate change will be weighed against any harm to the significance of the heritage 
assets affected.  
 
4.82 Further background informati on in relation to Mid Devon’s historic environment can be found within the Town 
and Village Character Assessment and Conservation Area Appraisals.  Where these are available, applications should 
make reference to how the proposed development contributes to wards the priorities set out in these documents. 
Specific studies may also be relevant to development proposals depending on their location. For instance, where 
development would affect the setting of Knightshayes Court or Killerton Park, the Council will have regard to The 
Setting of Knightshayes Park and Garden: A Historic Landscape Assessment (The Parks Agency; Sept 2007), or the 
Killerton Park Setting Study (Land Use Consultants; final report, April 2013), as appropriate. These documents are 
available o n the Council’s website and will be a material consideration when planning applications are determined. 
Applicants are encouraged to contact the Council to check if their site falls within the setting study areas surrounding 
Knightshayes or Killerton, and consider the implications of this at the design stage. It should also be noted that the 
areas covered by setting studies do not represent a finite limit of setting.  
 
4.83 Details of Mid Devon’s non -designated heritage assets are on the register of heritage  assets, which is 
available on the Council’s website. Further details of heritage assets are available from  Historic England and the 
Historic Environment Service at Devon County Council, which holds the Devon County Historic Environment Record.  
The Counci l will publish a local register of non -designated heritage assets.   
 
4.84 Existing registers of heritage assets are not an exhaustive list of heritage assets.  The Mid Devon local list is 
regularly reviewed to take account of new information.  A developme nt proposal might draw attention to a heritage 
asset that had not previously been identified or assessed.  The absence of an asset from the heritage asset register at 
the time an application is submitted does not indicate that the asset has no heritage val ue.   
 
 
Policy DM26  
 
Green infrastructure in major development  
 
Major development proposals must demonstrate that green infrastructure will be incorporated within 
the site as follows:  
 
a) Biodiversity mitigation, resulting in a net gain in biodiversity;  
b) Flood and water resource management;  
c) Green corridors and public rights of way to link the site to the wider GI network, provide walking   
and cycling opportunities and avoid habitat fragmentation; and  
d) New green infrastructure such as the creation o f native woodland where possible.  
 
Where evidence demonstrates that meeting these criteria in full would render the development 
unachievable, the Council will balance the benefits of the development against the objectives of this 144 
 policy .  Where appropriate , the Council will seek contributions toward off -site green infrastructure 
where on-site green infrastructure is unfavourable.   
 
4.85 Green infrastructure is a network of multi -functional green space with recreational, visual and ecological 
value.  It inc ludes:  
 
 - Natural and semi -natural green spaces such as grassland and nature reserves  
 - Green corridors such as hedgerows, verges and pub lic rights of way, or ‘blue infrastructure’ such as 
watercourses and other water bodies  
 - Public or private spaces such as gardens, parks, village greens and allotments  
 
4.86 Biodiversity is in long -term decline, with habitats becoming increasingly fragmented and degraded as a result 
of changing land use and agricultural practices.  National policy seeks to reverse th is trend, halting overall biodiversity 
loss and reintroducing well -functioning and coherent ecological networks for the benefit of all.  There is an opportunity 
for development in Mid Devon to play its part in improving the quality and connectivity of gree n infrastructure.  Green 
infrastructure in some cases can also serve the purpose of protecting or enhancing heritage assets.  
 
4.87 Major applications (defined in the glossary) should be accompanied by a habitat survey describing what flora 
and fauna are pr esent on the site, with particular regard to protected species.  In permitting the development, the 
Council must be satisfied that onsite biodiversity mitigation, where required, is sufficient to make the development 
acceptable in planning terms.  
 
4.88 Green infrastructure provided within major development sites should normally serve a variety of purposes 
such as flood attenuation, leisure and recreation, provision of natural habitats, and shading and cooling of buildings 
and public areas. Green infrastruct ure functions can co -exist in one place, so the land coverage does not have to be 
extensive in every case , although developments should recognise that floodplain cannot necessarily provide year -
round amenity access . Green infrastructure within the site sho uld be achieved as part of the broader objectives for 
high quality design set out in Policy DM1 (high quality design). Applicants should have regard to the Town and 
Country Planning Association document, Biodiversity by Design, and should explore opportuni ties for green 
infrastructure to deliver wider environmental measures, such as those set out in the SW River Basin Management 
Plan. Development incorporating green infrastructure will be required to submit management and maintenance details 
for the propose d green infrastructure .   
 
4.89 This policy should be considered alongside Policy S5, which sets local standards for the provision of public 
open space in new development.   
 
 
Policy DM27 
 
Protected landscapes  
 
Development proposals affecting the Blackdown  Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Dartmoor 
National Park, Exmoor National Park and the North Devon Biosphere Reserve must demonstrate that:    
 
a) Cultural heritage and the character, appearan ce, setting and other special qualities of the 
landscape  will be conserved or, where possible, enha nced; and 
b) Biodiversity will be conserved and enhanced where possible through  improved linking of 
habitats, appropriate landscaping and habitat creation.  
 
Major developments within or adjoining the Area of Outst anding Natural Beauty and Dartmoor or 
Exmoor National Parks will only be permitted in exceptional cases.  
 145 
 4.90 National policy accords the highest status of protection to the landscape and scenic beauty of Areas of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and Na tional Parks.  The Mid Devon district incorporates a very small part of 
Dartmoor National Park in the Cheriton Bishop parish, for which Dartmoor National Park Authority is the Local 
Planning Authority.  The district shares boundaries with both Dartmoor and  Exmoor National Parks.   
 
4.91 The Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) is a nationally important landscape 
designation, aiming to preserve and enhance the natural and historic landscape features, flora and fauna of the 
AONB.  The Bla ckdown Hills Management Plan outlines measures for the protection and management of this 
landscape.  Development should not in any way undermine the special qualities that led to the designation of this 
landscape as AONB.  
 
4.92 Part of the western side of the district falls within the transition area for the North Devon Biosphere Reserve.  
Biosphere Reserves are areas nominated by national governments and designated under UNESCO’s ‘Man and 
Biosphere Programme.’  These areas are recognised for their high bio diversity value combined with sustainable use of 
natural resources for the benefit of local communities.  The purpose of the biosphere reserve is to reconcile the 
conservation of biodiversity with human development needs.  The part of the reserve within Mi d Devon is known as a 
‘transition area’.  This does not benefit from the very high level of environmental protection found in the ‘core area’ at 
Braunton Burrows, but contains agricultural activities and local communities that are recognised for their prog ress 
towards achieving this environmental and economic balance.  
 
4.93 Further information on the cultural heritage, character, appearance and setting of the district’s landscapes 
may be found in the Mid Devon Landscape Character Assessment, the Devon Lands cape Character Assessment and 
Devon County Council’s Historic Environment Record, which the Council may use as a background to decision -
making. Where a development proposal would have potentially significant landscape impact, a Landscape and Visual 
Impact Assessment and ecological report will be required. For applications not supported by specific studies, such as 
small -scale proposals with no likely significant effects on the landscape or biodiversity, the requirements of the policy 
should be met through t he Design and Access Statement where one is required.   
 
4.94 Where major developments are proposed within protected landscapes or within the setting of protected 
landscapes or  National Parks, it must be demonstrated that they are sufficiently in the publi c interest to overcome any 
detriment to the landscape in question.  National policy criteria will be applied, including an assessment of the need for 
the development, consequences of approval or refusal, opportunities for an alternative location and the ex tent to 
which any detrimental effects on the environment could be mitigated . The impact of light pollution should also be 
considered with particular regard provided for the Dark Sky Reserve status of Exmoor National Park.    
 
 
Policy DM28  
 
Other protected sites  
 
Where development proposals would lead to an individual or cumulative adverse impact on Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest, ancient woodland, ancient trees, Regionally Important Geological Sites, 
County Wildlife Sites, Local Nature Reserves or pri ority habitats defined under the UK and Devon 
Biodiversity Action Plans, the Council will balance the overall benefits of the proposal against the 
impact.  Sufficient information must be provided for the Council to assess the significance of the 
impact aga inst the importance of the protected site and the species which depend upon it.  Planning 
permission will be granted where:  
 
a) The benefits of and need for the development clearly outweigh the direct and indirect impact to 
the protected site and the ecosy stem services it provides;  
b) The development could not be located in an alternative, less harmful location; and  146 
 c) Appropriate mitigation measures have been put in place. Where mitigation  measures are not 
possible compensatory measures in some cases may b e considered appropriate.  
 
 
Where development proposals are likely (leaving aside mitigation measures) to have a significant 
effect on a European site (as defined in regulation 8 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species 
Regulations 2017), an appropriate  assessment will be required. In such cases, planning permission 
will be refused unless it has been ascertained that with mitigation measures in place the development 
will not adversely affect the integrity of the site.     
 
4.95 European Sites  include habi tats protected under European Legislation, such as Special Areas of 
Conservation and Special Protection Areas for birds. There are no sites in Mid Devon that are designated at European 
level for wildlife protection or special conservation.  However, there is a European -designated Special Area of 
Conservation (SAC) adjacent to the district’s boundary on the A361 road near Rackenford, within North Devon district.  
While the policies in this plan incorporate counter -acting measures to reduce effects on SACs, t he protection of 
European sites is of the utmost importance.  Development that would adversely affect a European  site will not 
normally be permitted, given the stringent tests applied in Policy DM28 and the National Planning Policy Framework.    
 
4.96 Within the Mid Devon district, the Council accords the highest degree of importance to Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest, as these are sites of national importance with regard to flora, fauna, geological and physiographical 
(landform) features.  They are st atutorily protected from harmful operations under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 
1981. Proposed development that has an adverse effect on a Site of Special Scientific Interest, whether individually or 
in combination with other developments, will not norm ally be permitted.  Paragraph 118 of the National Planning 
Policy Framework will be applied.   
 
4.97 Ancient woodland will be accorded the same level of importance as Sites of Special Scientific Interest, as it 
comprises a number of woodland habitats that are a national priority for improvement under the UK Biodiversity Action 
Plan. Ancient woodland and trees are irreplaceable. As such, the opportunities for mitigation under criterion c) of the 
policy are limited, and planning permission is likely to be ref used for development that would result in the loss of 
ancient woodland or trees unless the need for, and benefits of, the development in that location clearly outweigh the 
loss. Where the Council becomes aware of ancient trees not previously identified and  under threat from development, 
a Tree Preservation Order will be considered.  
 
4.98 Regionally Important Geological Sites, being of regional significance, are also accorded a high degree of 
importance.  Mid Devon only has six such sites, within the parishe s of Crediton, Crediton Hamlets, Zeal Monachorum, 
Kentisbeare and Uffculme.  More information is available in the glossary.  Any development proposal that impacts 
upon one of these sites would need to be extremely well justified.   
 
4.99 County Wildlife Si tes are undesignated sites selected because of the presence of important habitats or 
species. There are over 200 such sites in Mid Devon, representing a variety of habitats. Development proposals 
adversely affecting a County Wildlife Site will be considere d on a case -by-case basis, according to the amount of 
information available about the site and its significance, relative to the type, scale and benefits of the development 
being proposed.  The same position will be taken on proposals that impact on Local Nature Reserves and priority 
habitats (other than ancient woodland) defined in the UK and Devon Biodiversity Action Plans.   
 
4.100  Priority habitats include certain classifications of grassland, heathland, woodland or marsh.  While the loss of 
irreplaceab le habitats will not normally be permitted, the Council will seek the replacement of a priority habitat where it 
is significantly affected and its replacement can be achieved, through a planning obligation as appropriate.  
 
4.101  The Countryside and Rights  of Way Act 2000, the UK Biodiversity Action Plan and a number of other 
Regulations and Directives also designate particular ‘protected species’ with legal protection.  It is an offence 
recklessly or deliberately to kill, injure, capture or disturb protect ed species, which includes carrying out works which 
obstruct, damage or destroy access to that species’ habitat. These provisions are set out in law and apply in addition 
to relevant policies in the Local Plan. The Council will require a protected species survey to be carried out in support 147 
 of any relevant planning application, including when the application site is not a protected site under Policy DM29 but 
may affect protected species such as bats and birds.  
 
4.102  Policy DM 28 affords protection to sites of significant wildlife or geological importance. Where adverse impacts 
are likely, planning permission will be refused unless there is particular justification that clearly outweighs the impact in  
that case. The Council will consider the wider implication s of any adverse impact to a protected site, such as its role in 
providing a vital wildlife corridor, attenuating flood risk or ensuring good water quality in a catchment. National policy 
criteria will be applied.  Where development is permitted and would lead to an adverse impact, appropriate mitigation 
measures should be put in place. Compensatory measures in some cases, where mitigation measures are not 
possible, may be considered appropriate. Compensatory measures are not possible in cases and will depe nd on the 
context of the protected site .  In the case of European sites, where the risk of harm to the integrity of a site has not 
been ruled out in an appropriate assessment planning permission may be granted for the development only if there is 
no altern ative solution and the development must be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. In 
such cases, any necessary compensatory measures must be secured.     
 
4.103  The protected sites listed in Policy DM 28 are identified on the Polic ies Map where they are within or adjoining 
a defined settlement. Larger sites are also identified on the district -scale map. Up -to-date mapping and information for 
County Wildlife Sites are held by Devon Biodiversity Record Centre (DBRC). Applicants are ad vised to contact DBRC 
when the full extent of a County Wildlife Site is in question.  
 148 
 Enforcement 
 
Policy DM29 
 
Planning enforcement  
 
The Council will investigate unauthorised development, acting proportionately to the scale of the 
suspected breach of pla nning control.  Enforcement action will be taken where it is appropriate to do 
so and in the public interest.   
 
4.104  Investigating suspected breaches of planning control is an important function of a Local Planning Authority.  
Unauthorised development ca n be detrimental to the local environment and be a source of social tension.  Failure to 
enforce planning conditions or address unauthorised development can reduce the effectiveness of a Local Planning 
Authority and undermine public confidence in the plann ing system.  
 
4.105  When undertaking investigations, the Council will act in proportion to the scale of the suspected breach to 
which it relates.  The Council will then take enforcement action where it deems such action to be appropriate, having 
regard to t he scale of the breach and the impact on public amenity.   
 
4.106  To ensure that enforcement is managed proactively and in a way that is appropriate to Mid Devon the Council 
has publish ed a Local Enforcement Plan.  This document set s out the Council’s appr oach to enforcement, including 
timescales for action and states  in detail how the Council will respond to suspected breaches of planning control.    
 149 
 150 
 5.1 Monitoring is important to understand the characteristics of the local area, assess the impact of policies and 
whether the strategy is delivering sustainable development so that the policies can be reviewed as appropriate. The 
Council is required to produce a Monitoring Report at least annually to provide information on the following matt ers: 
 
 • Progress of local plans including the timetable for completion, stage  reached and reasons for any       
delays;  
 • Any local plans or supplementary planning documents that have  been approved or adopted, including 
relevant dates;  
 • Decisions not t o implement any Local Plan policy including reasons  and steps to implement the policy 
in the future;  
 • The number of market and affordable dwellings built in the reporting  period and since the relevant 
Local Plan policy target was introduced;  
 • Any neigh bourhood plans or development orders made in the district;  
 • Progress on the implementation of the Community Infrastructure Levy, if any; and  
 • Actions taken to ensure cooperation with other local authorities and  prescribed organisations under 
the ‘duty to cooperate’.  
 
5.2 The Local Plan contains local indicators and targets where appropriate to inform this process and to measure 
the Council’s performance against relevant policies and legislation.

 Annex 1  
 
Glossary  
 
Adopted Policies Map (Proposals Map):  
 
A map showing the areas or sites to which local plan policies and proposals apply.  It will contain Inset Maps, showing parti cular 
areas in more detail.  
 
Affordable Housing:  
 
Social rented, affordable rented and inter mediate housing, provided to eligible households whose needs are not met by the market.  
Eligibility is determined with regard to local incomes and local house prices.  Affordable housing should include provisions to remain 
at an affordable price for futur e eligible households or for the subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision.  
 
Social rented housing is owned by local authorities and private registered providers (as defined in section 80 of the Housing  and 
Regeneration Act 2008) , for which guideline target rents are determined through the national rent regime.  It may also be owned by 
other persons and provided under equivalent rental arrangements to the above, as agreed with the local authority or with the 
Homes and Communities Agency.   
 
Affordable rented housing is let by local authorities or private registered providers of social housing to households who are  eligible 
for social rented housing.  Affordable Rent is subject to rent controls that require a rent of no more than 80 % of the local market 
rent (including service charges, where applicable).   
 
Intermediate housing is homes for sale and rent provided at a cost above social rent, but below market levels subject to the criteria 
in the Affordable Housing definition above.  These can include shared equity (shared ownership and equity loans), other low cost 
homes for sale and intermediate rent, but not affordable rented housing.  
 
Homes that do not meet the above definition of affordable housing, such as “low cost market” housi ng, may not be considered as 
affordable housing for planning purposes.  
 
Allocations:  
 
Proposals that a certain site or area of land should be developed for particular uses and/or buildings. They are shown on a P olicies 
Map, contained within the Local Plan or Local Development Framework. There will be a related policy setting out any parameters 
and criteria for the site, contained within the local plan.  
 
Assets of Community Value:  
 
A property or place that has been nominated by the local community and includ ed on the Council’s list of Assets of Community 
Value.  If a registered property is to be sold, the local community is given the opportunity to bid for it before it is relea sed for sale on 
the open market.  
 
Building Research Establishment Environmental As sessment Method (BREEAM):  
 
An environmental assessment method and rating system for buildings, to evaluate a building’s specification, design, construct ion 
and use.  
 
Car Club:  
 
An organisation that owns cars that are shared by its members.  People arrange  in advance when they want to use a car, and pay 
to use it.  The advantage is that members do not have to pay the whole cost of owning a car, but are able to use one when the y 
need to.  
 
 
 155 
  
 
Community Facilities:  
 
Community facilities provide for the health  and wellbeing, social, educational, spiritual, recreational, leisure and cultural needs of 
the community. They include pubs, post offices, shops, village halls, allotments, places of worship and various recreational 
facilities.  
 
Community Infrastructure L evy: 
 
A levy allowing local authorities to raise funds from owners or developers of land undertaking new building projects in their  area.  
 
Curtilage:  
 
The extent of the land around a property (particularly a dwelling) that often, but not always, delineates  the amount of land 
associated with the property.  For larger, particularly country properties, the curtilage may often only refer to an immediat e 
cultivated garden and associated forecourt, rather than any other land included within the overall ‘planning use’.  
 
Devon Biodiversity Record Centre (DBRC):  
 
An online database of over two million wildlife records, hosted by the Devon Wildlife Trust.  
 
Ecosystem services:  
 
The products of natural systems from which people derive benefits, including goods and servi ces, some of which can be valued 
economically and others which have a non -economic value.  Ecosystem services include: provisioning services (products from land 
and water); regulating services (processes such as pollination; water purification and climate regulation); cultural services (heritage, 
recreation, health and wellbeing); and supporting services (essential functions such as soil formation and nutrient cycling).    
 
Embodied carbon:  
 
The amount of CO2 emitted during a product’s entire lifecycle, incl uding raw material extraction, transport, manufacture, assembly, 
installation, maintenance, disassembly or demolition and decomposition. A complete assessment of embodied carbon is often 
termed ‘cradle to grave’, while an assessment limited to the early ph ases (up to the point the product leaves the factory) is called 
‘cradle to gate’.  
 
Green Infrastructure:  
 
A network of multi -functional green space with recreational, visual and ecological value.  
 
Local Development Scheme:  
 
A project plan for the prepara tion of local plans.  
 
Local Green Space:  
 
The designation of locally important land for special protection, ruling out development other than in exceptional cases.  Lo cal 
Green Space is designated when a local or neighbourhood plan is prepared or reviewed.   It must be reasonably close to the 
community it serves; have demonstrable local significance and interest; be local in character and not cover an extensive trac t of 
land.   
 
Low Carbon technologies:  
 
Includes energy for heating and cooling as well as gen erating electricity.  Low carbon technologies are those that can help reduce 
emissions (compared to conventional use of fossil fuels).  
 
Main Town Centre uses:  
 156 
 Retail development (including warehouse clubs and factory outlet centres); leisure, entertainmen t facilities the more intensive sport 
and recreational uses (including cinemas, restaurants, drive -through restaurants, bars and pubs, night -clubs, casinos, health and 
fitness centres, indoor bowling centres, and bingo halls); offices; and arts, culture an d tourism development (including theatres, 
museums, galleries and concert halls, hotel and conference facilities).  
 
Major development:  
 
Applications for residential development with a minimum of 10 dwellings or a 0.5 hectare site area, and planning applic ations for 
non-residential development with a minimum of 1000 square metres gross floor area, or a 1 hectare site area.  
 
Minor development:  
 
Planning applications which are not any of the following types: a major application, a change of use application or  a householder 
application.  
 
Neighbourhood plans:  
 
Plans and Development Orders produced by parish councils or other designated neighbourhood forums with the support of the 
local community, including Community Right to Build Orders.  
 
Planning obligation:  
 
A legal agreement or undertaking under Section 106 of The Town and Country Planning Act 1990.  Planning obligations provide a  
means of ensuring that developers contribute towards the infrastructure and services that are necessary to facilitate propose d 
development. The use of Section 106 Agreements is affected by the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations.  
 
Primary shopping area:  
 
Defined area where retail development is concentrated (generally comprising the primary and secondary shopping frontages whic h 
are adjoining and closely related to the primary shopping frontage).  
 
Primary and secondary frontages:  
 
Primary frontages are likely to include a high proportion of retail uses which may include food, drinks, clothing and househo ld 
goods.  Secondary fron tages provide greater opportunities for a diversity of uses such as restaurants, cinemas and businesses.  
Mid Devon towns do not have defined secondary frontages but these are generally located within the primary shopping area, 
outside of the primary shopp ing frontage (see Policies Maps).  
 
Priority habitat/species:  
 
Priority species and habitats are those that have been identified as being the most threatened and requiring conservation act ion 
under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan.  
 
Public Rights of Way (PRo W): 
 
Give you the right to walk, ride a horse or cycle along certain routes and are legally protected in the same way as roads.  
 
Recreational Trail:  
 
A corridor, route or pathway, generally land or water based, primarily intended for recreational purposes,  including walking, hiking, 
cycling, canoeing and horse -riding.  
 
Regionally Important Geological Sites (RIGS):  
  
These are the most important sites for geology and geomorphology outside of statutorily protected land such as Sites of Speci al 
Scientific Inte rest.  They are designated according to criteria set at regional or county level.  The following table details the six Mid 
Devon RIGS:

SX823985  Crediton Hamlets  Quarry with volcanic lava resting on soft reddish 
Knowle sandstone  
 
Renewable energy:  
 
Includes energy for heating and cooling and electricity generation.  Renewable energy c overs those energy flows that occur 
naturally and repeatedly in the environment – from the wind, the fall of water, the movement of the oceans, from the sun and also 
from biomass and deep geothermal heat.   
 
River Basin Management Plan (RBMP):  
 
A plan prod uced by the Environment Agency in order to meet the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive.  Each plan 
sets out the environmental objectives for all water bodies in the region and how they will be achieved. The South West RBMP can 
be downloaded f rom the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and Environment Agency website.  
 
Rural workers:  
 
Are people whose place of work is located within the countryside, typically comprising farm workers, forestry workers and others 
involved in rural -based enterprises.  
 
Self-Build and Custom Housebuilding:  
 
Homes built by individuals, associations of individuals or developers working with or for those individuals, to be occupied b y those 
individuals. Homes that are built wholly or mainly to plans or spec ifications decided or offered by a developer/seller are excluded.  
 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI):  
 
SSSIs are the country’s very best wildlife and geological sites.  SSSIs are important as they support plants and animals that  find it 
more diff icult to survive in the wider countryside.  The protection of SSSIs is a shared responsibility between landowners, local 
authorities and Natural England.  
 
Statement of Community Involvement:  
 
a statement within the Local Development Framework that sets ou t the Council’s policies for the public involvement in the 
preparation of Local Development Documents and planning applications.  
 
Supplementary Planning Document:  
 
a document within the Local Development Framework that sets out more detailed policies in su pport of those contained in a local 
plan. It does not form part of the Development Plan, but is a material consideration on planning applications.  
 
Sustainable Development:  158 
  
is development which meets the needs of the present while not preventing future g enerations meeting their own needs. The 
sustainability of local plans must be assessed through Sustainability Appraisals and Strategic Environmental Assessment 
(SA/SEA).  
 
Telecommunications development:  
 
Operational development and change of use of land to  provide buildings, instrumentation and other equipment necessary for 
telecommunications (telegraph, cable, telephone, radio, or television).  The National Planning Policy Framework sets out the 
requirements for decision -making on telecommunications propos als.  
 
Water Framework Directive (WFD):  
 
European Union legislation that requires all countries throughout the EU to manage the water environment to consistent standa rds. 
 
Zero carbon:  
 
A set of standards prepared by the Government for the construction of new homes which are intended to ensure zero net carbon 
emissions from on -going use and maintenance from the building.  Regulated emissions such as a building’s energy efficiency and 
onsite renewable or low carbon heat and power supply will be controlled th rough the Building Regulations, while any remaining 
emissions may be offset through ‘allowable solutions’ (to be determined by Government).

Procedural guidance  
Steps  Information required  Notes  
 
 
Step 1   
• Overview of development proposal.  
• Summary of pre -application discussions.  
• Identify boundaries of the assessment 
according to the proximity to an Air 
Quality Management Area, expected 
routes of travel, properties most affected 
and years of interest, to det ermine 
whether a concentrations -based air 
quality assessment is required under 
Policy DM6 criterion a).  
• Set out the assessment methodology 
used to comply with criterion a) of Policy 
DM6 if necessary, including sources of 
data and assumptions used.  
  
Year s of interest will be 
influenced by the 
anticipated operational 
commencement and 
lifespan of the 
development; the 
timescale to achieve 
specified national targets 
for emissions; and the 
availability of robust 
emissions data projected 
forward to 2020 or 
beyo nd. 
 
 
 
Step 2   
• Using the Low Emission Toolkit (or 
equivalent), calculate the baseline 
residual road transport emissions from 
the development, for the first operational 
year and specified future years after 
development trips have been reduced as 
far as p ossible.  The calculation should 
be based on a ‘without measures’ 
scenario, i.e. not including any low 
emission mitigation measures.  
• If an air quality assessment has been 
identified as necessary under Step 1, 
summarise: all impacts (during and post -
const ruction) on identified properties or 
other local receptor locations; any 
exceedances  of the air quality objectives 
resulting from the development; any 
effect on the delivery of the relevant Air 
Quality Action Plan; the significance of 
the results; and the options for measures  
Display data as annual 
emissions.

 Steps  Information required  Notes  
to reduce, mitigate or compensate an air 
quality impact.  
 
Step 3   
• Consider whether additional trip 
reduction measures can be incorporated.  
• Using the Low Emission Toolkit (or 
equivalent), evaluat e the impact on 
residual road transport emissions of 
applying low emission mitigation 
measures, both on and offsite, against 
‘business as usual’ baseline levels, for 
the specified years of interest.  
• Evaluate any trade -offs that occur as a 
result of mitig ation measures, for 
instance where one pollutant would 
decrease but another increase, or where 
there is a net increase in the road traffic 
emissions in Mid Devon but a decrease 
within the Air Quality Management Area.  
• If an air quality assessment is inclu ded 
(see Step 1), summarise the effect that 
mitigation measures will have on: 
identified properties or other local 
receptor locations; any exceedances  of 
the air quality objectives resulting from 
the development; and any effect on the 
delivery of the relev ant Air Quality Action 
Plan.  
  
Steps 2 and 3 may be 
combined as a site 
emissions mitigation 
plan, with clear links to 
the Travel Plan.  
 
 
Step 4   
• Calculate the remaining residual road 
transport emissions after mitigation 
measures have been incorporated, using 
a ‘mass emissions’ approach (Low 
Emissions Toolkit) and in addition a 
concentrations -based approach in cases 
where criterion a) of Policy DM6 applies 
(see Step 1).   
  
 
The Local Planning 
Authority may wish to 
negotiate 
further/alternative 
mitigation  measures, 
requiring a revised LEA 
to be submitted.  
 
 
Step 5   
• Translate the calculated remaining 
residual road transport emissions into 
damage costs for the pollutants of 
concern.  (Information on calculating 
damage costs is available from DEFRA:  
If damage costs are 
significant, the Local 
Planning Authority will 
consider whether a 
Section 106 Agreement 161 
 Steps  Information required  Notes  
http:/ /www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quali
ty/air/air -quality/economic/damage/)  
 is required and feasible 
to make the 
development acceptable 
in planning te rms, to 
deliver a cost -equivalent 
air quality improvement 
identified in the relevant 
Air Quality Action Plan. 
In this case the 
identified project would 
be excluded from the 
Council’s list of 
infrastructure funded by 
the Community 
Infrastructure Levy 
(CIL).   CIL would remain 
payable for all other 
generic offsite 
infrastructure.  The 
Council may take legal 
advice before deciding 
on this approach, where 
a Section 106 
Agreement would 
deliver off -site 
infrastructure.
