  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan

 1.0 Introduction  
 
What is the Borough Plan Review?  
 
1.1 The Borough Plan Review is the key document that provides the framework to 
guide future development in Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough up to 2039. It 
will influence what development will take place, how much and where it will be 
located within the Borough. I t sets out an ambitious vision and strategic 
objectives, followed by a development strategy for the Borough which is 
focused on delivering growth in a sustainable manner. It includes thematic 
policies for managing development and protecting the environment  to ensure 
that the Borough Plan’s vision can be delivered.  
 
1.2 The Borough Plan Review includes a number of measures to monitor the 
progress being made in achieving the strategic objectives of the plan on an 
annual basis.  
 
1.3 The proposed publication plan rep resents what the Borough Council considers 
to be the final version of this plan, in accordance with Regulation 19 of the Town 
and Country Planning (Local Planning)  (England)  Regulations 2012 (as 
amended).  
 
1.4 The publication plan allows interested parties to comment on the plan before it 
is submitted to the Secretary of State. After responses are received, they are 
sent, along with the plan and its evidence , to the Secretary of State and the 
examination in public will follow. Once adopted, the Borough Plan Rev iew will 
replace the current Borough Plan , which was adopted in 2019  and guides 
development in the Borough up to 2031 .The Borough Plan Review seeks to 
review  and where relevant update all the policies within the adopted Borough 
Plan as well as create new policies. A list of all the adopted policies within the 
Borough , which are proposed to be replaced or deleted once the Borough Plan 
Review is adopted , is set out within Appendix A.  
 
Context for the Borough Plan Review  
 
1.5 The content o f the Borough Plan has been informed by a number of documents, 
as is required by Government.  
 
National Planning Policy Framework and Planning Practice Guidance  
 
1.6 The National Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF) (2021) sets out Government 
policy on planning matters, seeks to create sustainable communities and fost er 
sustainable development. The policies in the NPPF provide the national 
framework within which local policy should be prepared. The Planning Practice 
Guidance  (PPG) provides, among other things, direction in preparing evidence 
to inform the Borough Plan Review. The Borough Plan Review has been 
prepared in accordance with the NPP F and PPG.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
2 
 The Council’s Corporate Plan  
 
1.7 The Borough Plan Rev iew is a delivery document for the Council’s Corporate 
Plan – ‘Building a Better Borough’ . The policies within the Borough Plan Review 
support the Counc il’s vision of  the Borough being the place of choice to live, 
work and visit . 
 
Evidence  
 
1.8 The Borough Plan Review is based on a comprehensive and robust evidence 
base. A number of detailed and technical assessments have been prepared to 
inform and justify the policies and proposals within this plan. All of the evidence 
base can be viewed on the  Borough Council’s website.  
 
Strategic Environmental Assessment and Sustainability Appraisal  
 
1.9 To ensure the Borough Plan Review is effective in meeting the needs of future 
generations, in a sustainable manner, a Strategic Environmental Assessment 
and a Su stainability Appraisal have been undertaken alongside each stage of 
the Borough Plan Review. This will ensure that the plan positively contributes 
to the economic, social and environmental considerations of the Borough. The 
outcomes of this work , during each stage of the process , have been presented 
in separate reports which are available via the Council’s website.  
 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan  
 
1.10 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan  (IDP)  sits alongside the Borough Plan Review. 
It provides information about the infrastructure that needs to be delivered to 
support the policies and growth targets set in the Borough Plan Review. It 
outlines the sources of funding for projects and those who will be responsible 
for the delivery of the infrastructure.  
 
Duty to cooperate  
 
1.11 Introduced through the Localism Act 2011, the duty to cooperate is a legal 
requirement of the plan making process. The NPPF states that, “Local planning 
authorities and county councils (in two -tier areas) are under a duty to cooperate 
with each other, and with other prescribed bodies, on strategic matters that 
cross administrative boundaries”. Throughout the preparation of the Borough 
Plan Review , the Council has positively engaged with partner organisations , 
such as statutory  consultees and other relevant local authorities , under the duty 
to cooperate. Collaboration between the Council and other local authorities and 
infrastructure providers, will be  documented through Statements of Common 
Ground, demonstrating effective and o n-going joint working and indicating 
cross boundary matters are being addressed and progressed. These 
documents also identify relevant strategic matters which will be addressed in 
the Borough Plan Review.

 Preparation of the Borough Plan Review  
 
1.12 The process of reviewing the Borough Plan began in 2021 and has been broken 
 down into a number of stages , which are as follows:  
 
• Issues  and Options  - this document was the first stage of the proces s 
consulted on between June and August 2021 . It set out the issues facing 
the Borough and presented a range of options to address them.  
 
• Preferred Options  – this document was consulted on between June and July  
2022 and sets out the Council’s pre ferred approach to addressing the 
strategic issues facing the Borough. This included specific locations and 
sites to address the future development needs and planning policies  of the 
Borough .  
 
• Publication draft plan  (this stage) - this Regulation 19 document represents 
the Council’s view of the contents of the Borough Plan Review, published 
for consultation prior to submission and examination in public.

 2.0 Local context  of the Borough  
 
2.1 The Borough of Nuneaton and Bedworth is most famous for being the 
birthplace of the author George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans). It is one of five 
Boroughs /districts within Warwickshire. It is the smallest in size, at 7,895 
hectares, but has the third largest population at 134,200 (2021)1. Largely urban 
in character, the Borough has two market towns - Nuneaton and Bedworth, as 
well as the large village of Bulkington to the east of Bedworth. Several smaller 
settlements are located in the south of the Borough be tween Bedworth and 
Coventry.  
 
2.2 The Borough is located between Coventry and Hinckley, and benefits from 
good road links. Nuneaton and Bedworth are both easily accessible from the 
M6, which gives access to the M1, M5, M42 and the M69. The A5 runs along 
the no rthern boundary of the Borough  and the A444, A4254 and the B4114 are 
the major routes within the Borough. The Borough is a 19 -minute drive to 
Birmingham International Airport and a 37 -minute drive to Nottingham East 
Midlands Airport.  
 
2.3 Nuneaton is also well  connected by the rail network. Nuneaton has direct links 
to London (60 -80 minutes) via the West Coast mainline, a longside  Birmingham, 
Leicester, Cambridge and Stansted Airport. A branch line also provides direct 
services from Nuneaton, Bermuda Park and Be dworth stations to Coventry 
Arena, Coventry and Leamington Spa. As part of the NUCKLE2 north -south rail 
project, facilities at Bedworth Station have been improved and a new station 
has been created at Bermuda. The vision for the NUCKLE project is to impro ve 
services from hourly to half hourly services  between Coventry and Nuneaton . 
 
2.4 Historically, industries in the Borough included coal mining, other extractive 
industries and heavy engineering. The Borough still has a high proportion of 
employees working in manufacturing compared to the Great Britain average3. 
Other significant employment sectors are wholesale and retail trade , and 
human health and social work4. In terms of the business base of the Borough’s 
local economy, micro enterprises make up 89%, small enterprises 9%, medium 
enterprises 1.5% and large enterprises 0.5%5. 
 
2.5 Most employment is con centrated on a number of industrial estates. The main 
sites are at Attleborough Fields, Bayton Road, Bermuda and Prologis Park but 
smaller estates are located across the Borough. The town centres of Nuneaton 
and Bedworth also provide a significant number o f jobs.  
 
2.6 Nuneaton Town Centre is the main retail and commercial centre serving the 
whole Borough as well as further afield, whereas Bedworth Town Centre serves 
a more local role. Nuneaton Town Centre includes the Ropewalk and

 Abbeygate shopping centres, th e Borough’s main library, council offices and 
railway station. Bedworth Town Centre has a large superstore, independent 
shops and branches of high street stores, a library, emergency services, the 
Civic Hall and Bedworth Arts Centre. In addition to the tow n centres are a 
number of district and local centres supporting smaller neighbourhoods.  
 
2.7 Bermuda Park to the south of Nuneaton provides a multiplex cinema, bowling 
alley and other leisure facilities. In terms of sports facilities, The Pingles Leisure 
Centr e and Etone Sports Centre are noteworthy facilities, both located in 
Nuneaton. Bedworth also has a leisure centre and a number of local facilities 
and sports pitches which provide places for sport and exercise. Other key 
community facilities include the Ge orge Eliot Hospital and North Warwickshire 
and Hinckley College.  
 
2.8 There are over 500 hectares of accessible green space in the Borough. Notable 
parks in the Borough include Riversley Park, Miners Welfare Park and 
Whittleford Park, all of which are destinat ion parks, serving the whole Borough. 
A number of smaller community and local parks also serve the open space 
needs of local communities.  
 
2.9 The Borough contains the only European designated site (Special Area of 
Conservation) in Warwickshire at Ensor’s Pool. This and Griff Quarry are both 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). There are also locally designated 
wildlife sites and areas of ancie nt woodland. Additionally, three  local nature 
reserves are located at Ensor’s Pool, Galley Common and Bedworth Sloughs.  
 
2.10 Historic legacies of the coal mining industry are present within the Borough, 
along with the historic transport network of the Coventr y and Ashby de -la-
Zouch canals. The canals are heritage assets in their own right, as well the 
buildings and structures that are closely associated with them6. They form 
recreational green and blue links and wildlife corridors along with the disused 
Nunea ton Ashby Railway (Weddington Walk) through the centre, east and 
north of the Borough.  
 
2.11 The River Anker, River Sowe, Harrow Brook, Wem Brook, Breach Brook and 
Change Brook act as the main rivers flowing through the Borough.  
 
2.12 Located in the Borough is Arbur y Hall, a Grade I listed building with grounds 
which are classified as Grade II* registered park and gardens. The Arbury 
Estate also contains a number of other listed buildings and structures. Overall, 
the Borough contains 92 listed buildings and has five conservation areas which 
are located in Abbey, Nuneaton Town Centre, Bedworth Town Centre, 
Bulkington Village and at Hawkesbury Junction. There are also two scheduled 
monuments, one at the Moated Site at Exhall Hall and the other at Nuneaton 
Priory.  
 
2.13 Nuneaton and Bedworth has the highest levels of deprivation across 
Warwickshire and ranks as the 101st most deprived local authority district

 nationally (out of 317)7. Within Nuneaton and Bedworth there is also a divide 
between the east and west, with the most deprived areas located in the west. 
Five Super Output Areas within Nuneaton and Bedworth are in the top 10% 
most deprived nationally8. Bar Pool North and Crescents is in the top 3% 
deprived Super Output Areas in England9. 
 
2.14 Specific areas where t he Borough falls behind the Warwickshire average 
include deprivation, crime rates and life expectancy10. This has resulted in a 
significant gap separating Nuneaton and Bedworth from the rest of the county.

 3.0 Key issues facing the  
Borough  
 
Background  
 
3.1 This section summarises the key issues and challenges within the Borough. 
The Borough Plan aims to address these issues in order to achieve its vision 
for Nuneaton and Bedworth by 2039.  
 
3.2 One of the fundamental issues that policy makers,  including all Local 
Authorities, face over the coming years is resilience and adaptation to climate 
change alongside measures to protect and improve the environment11. This 
includes achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, improving air and water quality, 
sustainable use of resources and promoting nature recovery. Whilst national 
legislation is still emerging on this, the reviewed Borough Plan treats this as 
integral to all policies. As such, rather than these issues being dealt with by a 
standalone policy or development planning document, the Council has taken 
the opinion and decision (at this current time) that this is to be treated as a key 
thread running throughout its policies. This includes consideration of the 
climate change risks and opportunities, iden tified within the region, to align 
policies where appropriate with the regional Climate Change Adaptation Plan12. 
 
Issues associated with the local economy  
 
3.3 The following issues have been identified:  
 
• The population and the number of households is growing, and this is 
projected to continue13.  
• There are fewer knowledge -based employment opportunities. If this does 
not change, there will be fewer jobs in the future and more people will have 
to look for work outside the Borough.  
• A large number of residents commute out of the Borough each day to wor k 
in Coventry, Leicestershire and elsewhere in Warwickshire14. 
• Within the Borough there is a divide between the east and west, with the 
most deprived areas located in the west.  
• Household earnings are lower than the Warwickshire average15. This 
contributes significantly to poverty and deprivation.

 • Access to some employment sites such as Attleborough Fields, Prologis 
and other employment sites outside the Borough is difficult without a car.  
• Car ownership in the Borough is lower than the Warwicksh ire average16. 
Improvements in public transport along the north -south corridor are required 
to improve accessibility to job opportunities.  
• Some residents have a poor skills base. 28% of those of working age have 
no qualifications at all17. 
• There is a need to tackle low aspirations in parts of the Borough as this can 
limit educational achievement and contribute to low wages, deprivation and 
a dependency on benefits.  
• The quality and diversity of retail provision in Nuneaton is limited. The town 
has a strong m arket but the challenge will be for it to remain attractive and 
competitive in the future in the face of growing online retail.  
• Nuneaton does not have a strong evening or night -time economy, with a 
relatively limited offer in terms of restaurants and bars.  There is limited 
transport provision after 6pm.  
• Office provision in Nuneaton is limited, basic and is reducing economic 
opportunities in the town centre. There are also few residential properties in 
the town centre which affects the town’s diversity and v ibrancy.  
• Bedworth Town Centre struggles to compete for retail trade and its office 
sector is small. This is due to its proximity to the larger centres of Coventry 
and Nuneaton. The town centre has little residential or leisure provision 
other than the Civi c Hall, and therefore the evening economy is weak. The 
ways in which Bedworth can best compliment Nuneaton, in the future, needs 
to be addressed.  
• The quality, popularity and variety of retail provision offered , at local and 
district centres , varies greatly.  
• Traffic congestion is high across the Borough and Nuneaton has 
experienced the highest rate of traffic growth across Warwickshire18. 
Particular problems occur on the A444, The Long Shoot (A47), Lutterworth 
Road (B4114), Camp Hill /Tuttle Hi ll (B4114) and Coventry Road (B4109).  
 
Issues associated with the local community  
 
3.4  The following issues have been identified:  
 
• The current housing stock is predominately semi -detached and terraced.  
• The mix of housing tenure, types and sizes for different parts of the Borough 
is uneven.  
• Population and household projections suggest an on -going need for family 
accommodation19.

 • There is a need to cater for an increasing number of young people and older 
people living on their own. There is a particular need for housing options to 
enable older people to live independently20. 
• The areas around Bulkington and the south -west of the Borough are not well 
served by green corridors. This reduces biodiversity and opportunities for 
leisure activities in these areas.  
• Access to some leisure facilities is restricted for people without a car. Public 
transport to Bermuda Park, for instance, is limited and there are no public 
footpaths along the A444.  
• Life expectancy is lower than the Warwickshire average21. Links can be 
made to poor health, lack of physical activity and obesity, all of which are 
high in the Borough.  
• Investment has taken place to bring 85% of homes in line with the Decent 
Homes Standard22 but there are still homes which need to be upgraded.  
• Improvements to provide more walking and cycling networks, cycle parking 
facilities, pedestrian priority areas and crossing facilities along with the need 
to address issues such as the frequency, reliabi lity, integration and cost of 
public transport , is required to facilitate benefits to the environment and 
health.  
• Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) are designated at the Leicester 
Road Gyratory and at Central Avenu e/Midland Road in Nuneaton.  
• Previous de velopment has not always been well designed. Too much 
development in the past has failed to positively contribute to the character 
of the area or to local distinctiveness.  
• Crime is the highest in Warwickshire23.  
 
Issues associated with the local environme nt 
 
3.5 The following issues have been identified:  
 
• Extreme weather events, such as those experienced in Warwickshire in 
1998, 1999, 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2012, are becoming more frequent  
(Climate Change predictions , including the UK Climate Projections 2018 
(UKCP18) , refer to the likely increase in temperatures and warmer wetter 
winters and drier summers ).    
• If future growth needs to be accommodated outside the existing urban 
areas , this has the potential to impact on sensitive landscapes and 
biodiversity.  
• The legacy of coal mining, quarrying and heavy engineering has had a 
negative impact on the landscape. The Borough has over 100 hectares of 
derelict land and more than 3 ,000 potent ially contaminated sites.  
• There are a limited number of historic buildings of national importance but 
many others are important to local history.

 6.0   Development strategy  
 
6.1 The following policies set out the strategic development strategy and general  
principles for the growth of the Borough through to 2039. The policies will 
enable the delivery of the overarching vision for the Borough and strategic 
objectives of the plan.  
 
Strategic Policy DS1 – Sustainable development  
 
 
The Council will secure sustainable development by requiring all new development 
to contribute towards the national need to achieve net zero carbon emissions. 
Development m ust be adaptabl e/resilient to climate change, of a high quality, 
address the prudent use /safeguarding of natural resources and be fully supported 
by infrastructure provision. Development should also provide environmental 
mitigation and enhancement, whilst at the same time sustaining and enhancing the 
historic environment in line with policies set out in this plan. Car -free 
neighbourhoods will be encouraged. Furthermore, the re -use of previously 
developed land and the re -use of buildings as a sustainable opt ion is encouraged 
whilst the achievement of national standards for highway design and sustainable 
transport infrastructure will be supported.  
 
Climate change adaption includes building new developments in line with water 
resource efficient design to 110 li tres/person /day, as well as environmental 
mitigation such as sustainable urban drainage systems.  
 
The Council will secure sustainable development by requiring all new development 
to contribute towards the national need to achieve net zero carbon emissions.  
 
Planning applications that accord with national policies and the policies in this 
Borough Plan Review (and where relevant, with policies in neighbourhood plans, 
other adopted Development Plans and adopted supplementary planning documents 
(SPDs) (or as per any  subsequent  updates) will be supported unless material 
considerations indicate otherwise.  
 
Where there are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are out of 
date at the time of making the decision, then the Council will grant permission unless 
material considerations indicate otherwise – taking into account whether any 
adve rse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably 
outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF taken as a 
whole; or specific policies in the Framework that indicate development should be 
restricted.  
 
 
6.2 The NPPF sets out the presumption in favour of sustainable development and 
the need for sustainable economic growth. Sustainable development is at the 
heart of local planning and the Borough Council has a key role to play in  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
15 
 reducing carbon emissions, seeking  improvements in the quality of the built, 
natural and historic environment and managing and adapting to changes in the 
Borough, such as new housing, economic requirements and associated 
infrastructure. For example, the Borough Plan Review prioritises  the re -use of 
previously developed land and sustainable development through the settlement 
hierarchy approach, demonstrated in Strategic Policy DS2 – Settlement 
hierarchy and roles.   
 
6.3 Local plans and development strategies must be positivel y prepared, justified, 
effective and consistent with national policy. This policy underpins the Borough 
Plan Review and sets out the key development principles against which 
development proposals will be assessed.   
 
6.4 Both national policy and the Borough Plan Review are clear that new 
developments must take into account the implications of climate change. The 
protection of grasslands and the planting of trees and orchards are recognised 
and encouraged in this plan. Howe ver, other  carbon zero initiatives may be 
equally  important , including the rete ntion of existing trees. The future 
maintenance of these trees should also be considered. Whilst there is no doubt 
that tree and orchard planting can provide a number of benefits, the habitat 
value of the land has to be considered first , as this could potentially have more 
value than tree planting. This is also required within the Council’s Open Space 
SPD but no target requirements have been set in order that good value ha bitat 
is not sacrificed. This is to ensure each site is assessed on a site -by-site basis.  
 
6.5     The protection and enhancement of the historic environment is recognised and 
encouraged in this plan.  
 
Strategic Policy DS2 – Settlement hierarchy and roles  
 
 
The hierarchy of the Borough’s settlements are:  
 
1. Nuneaton has the primary role for employment, housing, town centre, leisure 
and service provision.  
2. Bedworth has the secondary role for employment, housing, town centre, 
leisure and service provision.  
3. Bulkington has the tertiary role for housing, shopping, leisure and local 
services. Bulkington includes  a district centre.  
4. ‘Northern fringe’ of Coventry. This includes Keresley and Ash Green /Neal’s 
Green. These areas have supporting roles for housing, shopping and local 
services. Ash Green includes  a local centre.  
 
The majority of new development over the plan period will be directed to Nuneaton 
as the primary town. Development will be directe d to other settlements, at a scale 
that reflects the role and function of the settlement and its order in the hierarchy, as 
well as the settlement’s ability to accommodate change.  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
16 
 Within existing settlements, t he re -use of previously developed land will b e 
encouraged for new development and schemes will be supported where 
underutilised land and /or buildings are brought into a more efficient use.   
 
New development within the settlement boundaries, as shown on the policies map, 
will be acceptable subject to  there being a positive impact on amenity, the 
surrounding environment and local infrastructure.  
 
New unallocated development outside the settlement boundaries, as shown on the 
policies map, is limited to agriculture, forestry, leisure and other uses that can be 
demonstrated as appropriate, to require a location outside of the settlement 
boundaries.  
 
 
6.6  A key priority for the development strategy is to direct growth to the most 
sustainable locations which make full use of public transport, walking and 
cycling.  
 
6.7  A settlement hierarchy study of Nuneaton and Bedworth proposed a settlement 
hierarchy for the Borough. The order of the hierarchy is set out within the policy. 
This was based on an analysis of the size of each settlement in the a rea, 
accessibility to a range of services and facilities, as well as public transport 
provision. The report places Nuneaton at the top of the hierarchy, as the most 
sustainable settlement in the Borough, whilst Bedworth and Bulkington have a 
secondary and tertiary role respectively.  
 
6.8 In considering the roles of the settlements, it is also necessary to consider the 
wider context in which the Borough is located. Of particular relevance is the 
close proximity of other settlements outside the Borough bounda ry. To the 
south of the Borough there is the city of Coventry and to the north of the 
Borough the A5 corridor and its surrounding settlements.  
 
6.9 The principles for determining where new development will take place and what 
development is acceptable insi de and outside of the settlement boundaries 
have been formed following careful consideration of the issues for the Borough 
and the identified strategic objectives. As part of the plan making process the 
settlement boundaries have been reviewed and where ne cessary amended in 
line with the methodology set out in the Settlement Boundary Paper (2023). 
Within the Borough, settlement boundaries define Nuneaton, Bedworth, 
Bulkington, Ash Green /Neal’s Green and Keresley.

Strategic Policy DS 3 – Overall development needs  
 
 
By 2039, as a minimum, the following levels of housing and employment 
development will be planned for and provided within Nuneaton and Bedworth 
Borough:  
 
• 9,810 homes based on 545 dwellings per annum.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
18 
 • 66.45ha of employment land for  local industrial and distribution /warehousing 
development  (including 5.35ha for replacement provision).  
• 2ha of employment land for office space.  
• 19.4ha of employment la nd for strategic B8 warehousing and distribution 
development (indicative).  
 
A further 5.6ha of land will be allocated as future cemetery land  (burial space ) 
(allocation CEM1) to meet the Borough’s needs up to 2039 and beyond.  
 
For Gypsy and Traveller pitches and Showperson plots, reference should be made 
to the requirements set out in Strategic Policy GT1 (Overall Need) of the Gypsy and 
Traveller Site Allocations Development Plan Document  (DPD)  (due to be adopted 
2023) .  
 
 
Housing land  
 
6.14 The starting point for determining the housing target for the Borough is the 
NPPF  and the associated PPG. The NPPF states that to determine the 
minimum number of homes needed, strategic policies should be informed by a 
local housing need assessment, conducted using the standard method in 
national planning guidance, unless exceptional circumstances justify an 
alternative approach which also reflects current and future demographic trends 
and market signals. In addition to the local housing need figure, any needs that 
cannot be met within neighbouring areas should also be considered in 
establishing the amount of h ousing to be planned for.  
 
6.15 The ‘standard method’, set out in the PPG, utilises the 2014 household 
projections over a 10-year period and applies the most recent affordability 
ratios. In December 2020, the PPG was updated to apply a 35 % uplift to the 20 
most populated urban authority areas in England. Coventry , who are a 
neighbouring authority,  is subject to the 35 % uplift. The ‘standard method’ figure 
for Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough is 442 dwellings per annum which 
incorporates the af fordability ratios released in March 202 3. 
 
6.16 The Preferred Options document identified a housing target of 9,690 dwellings 
(646 dwellings per annum). These figures were derived from the draft Nuneaton 
and Bedworth Housing and Economic Development Needs  Assessment 
(HEDNA) (May 2022) which was prepared by Iceni to support the Preferred 
Options consultation and w as calculated using an ‘alternative standard 
projection’ based on more detailed analysis of household projections and 
demographics. The detailed a nalysis undertaken by Iceni considers that recent 
population growth is higher for Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough than reflected 
in the 2014 based household projections. Given that concerns had been raised 
regarding the accuracy of the Office for National St atistic’s population estimates 
for Coventry, leading to the population being overestimated, the analysis in the 
draft HEDNA utilises dwelling completions since 2011 and data from the 
Patients Register  to derive the figure of 646 dwellings per annum.  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
19 
 6.17 In addition to the draft HEDNA  (May 2022) , the Council , alongside Coventry 
and Warwickshire authorities , appointed Iceni to prepare a sub -regional 
HEDNA to provide a more up -to-date assessment of local housing need for 
each authority. In accordance with  the exceptional circumstances set out in 
PPG, the sub -regional  HEDNA also derives away from the standard 
methodology and models new demographic projections which take into account 
the 2021 census data, across a 10-year period which allows for a longer 
economic cycle. The 2021 census data was not published at the time the 
Council consulted on its Preferred Options which is why a separate draft 
HEDNA (2022) wa s commissioned as well as the sub -regional HEDNA.   
  
6.18 Using  the trend -based projections, the housing need figure for Nuneaton and 
Bedworth Borough Council , in the sub -regional HEDNA , was calculated at 409 
dwellings per annum.  This figure is significantly lower than the figure consulted 
on at the Preferred Options stage. As set out in the sub -regional HEDNA report 
this is primarily due to the sub -regional HEDNA utilising the latest Census data 
which was released in June 2022. T herefore, the sub -regional HEDNA 
modelled the new demographic projections and assessed how the population 
is expected to change over time and applied these alternative projections , 
through the framework provided , to the standard method to deduce a figure o f 
409 dwellings per annum.  
 
6.19 Table 2 shows this figure comparatively with the other authorities in the Housing  
Market Area and compared with the standard method requirement , as set out 
within the sub -regional HEDNA.

Table 2: Local Authorities’ housing need within the Coventry and Warwickshire Housing Market Area.  
 
6.20 The vision and  strategic  objectives articulated in the plan reflect the Council’s 
ambitions in achieving sustainable growth and regeneration to become a 
thriving Borough where people want to live, work and visit. Given that the 
housing figure for the Borough i n the sub -regional HEDNA is lower than both 
the standard method and the figure consulted on in the Preferred Options 
document , there was concern that this level of growth did not reflect the 
economic aspirations for the Borough  over the plan period . The sub -regional  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
20 
 HEDNA predicted that the Council will experience the lowest level of economic 
growth within the Housing Market Area . However , there is evidence which 
show s that the economy could perform more strongly and there is a strong 
justification , when reviewing the Council’s strategies , including the Economic 
Strategy and Transforming Nuneaton Programme , for higher housing provision 
to align the strategies for homes and jobs within the Borough going forward.  
 
6.21 Therefore, the Council commissioned  Iceni to prepare a bespoke report 
‘Towards our Housing Requirement ’ to supplement and be read alongside the 
sub-regional HEDNA. The report considers the objectively assessed housing 
need set out within the HEDNAs as well as other considerations which may 
influence the Council’s decision on an appropriate housing and employment 
requirement. These include the affordable housing need in the Borough and the 
delivery of affordable housing , which is influenced by the overall housing 
provision and development viability, the levelling up agenda to ensure 
opportunity for the north of the county , emerging strategies and potential issues 
of unmet housing need from other parts of the Housing Marke t Area.  
 
6.22 The report models a Planned Economic Growth Scenario which would require 
the delivery of 545 dwellings per annum , over the plan period to 2039 , to 
support the Borough’s economy and align planning for homes, jobs and 
infrastructure. In accorda nce with national policy and PPG , where authorities 
can show an alternative approach identifies a need higher than using the 
standard method, and that it reflects current and future demographic trends and 
market signals, then the approach can be considered  sound as it will exceed 
the minimum starting point. This is the case for Nuneaton and Bedworth 
Borough Council.  
 
6.23 A figure of 545 dwellings per annum over the plan period equates to 9,810 
dwellings. This will comprise of housing completions in the plan period, housing 
allocations, existing sites with full and outline planning permission, prior 
notification /approvals, strategic and non -strategic housing allocations, with an 
allowance for windfall developments .  
 
Housing delivery  
 
6.24 As set out above, Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough will make provision for a 
minimum of  9,810 dwellings between 2021 and 2039. This equates to an annual 
requirement of 545 dwellings each year , which is the Borough’s housing need 
as established within the repo rt ‘Towards our Housing Requirement’ .   
 
6.25 The delivery of housing development , for the plan period , is broken down 
through the following means (base date 31st March 2023):  
 
 
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
21 
  
Status  Total  
Net Completions (1 April 2021 - 31 March 2023)  1,790 
Committed supply of dwellings (at 1 April 2023)  4,207 
Residual need for plan period  3,813 
Strategic housing allocations  4,769 
Non-strategic housing allocations  689 
Borough Plan Review allocations  5,458 
Windfall sites25 630 
Total Housing Supply  12,127 
 
Table 3: Housing delivery.  
 
6.26 Table 3 demonstrates the provision of approximately 12, 085 dwellings through 
the Borough Plan Review. Such supply is in excess of the minimum housing 
requirement of 9,810 homes within Strategic Policy DS 3 – Overall Development 
Needs. This buffer provides flexibility in the housing supply across the plan 
period in the unforeseen event that some of the identified sites do not come 
forward  as predicted.  
 
6.27 In the two years prior to April 2023, the Council has delivered 1 ,790 new homes 
 within the Borough, at an average rate of 895 dwellings per annum. Housing 
 delivery has increased significantly since 2021. In the ten years before the plan 
 period the average number of homes completed each year had been 424 
 dwellings. This increase in the number of homes completed annually is primarily 
 due to a large number of s trategic allocations , from the adopted Borough Plan 
 2011 -2031 , delivering homes in the early part of this plan period.  
 
6.28 Phasing is one of the most important aspects of housing delivery to ensure that 
 all the development which comes forward is sustainable. Given the cross over 
 of this plan period with that of the previous Borough Plan, it is likely that the 
 strategic hous ing allocations will continue to deliver in the earlier to middle 
 years of the plan period. A housing trajectory of the anticipated completions of 
 development is set out in Appendix B. The Council will regularly review its 
 housing trajectory to ensure i t is up -to-date and realistic in terms of delivery in 
 accordance with national policy and PPG.  
 
6.29 The NPPF requires the Council to maintain a five year  supply of housing sites. 
At the point of submission of the plan, for the five years 2023 – 2027, based on 
the projected completions in the trajectory, there is a 10.9 year supply (with a 
20% buffer). This is justified given the plan seeks to ensure the co ntinued 
delivery of strategic sites allocated within the adopted Borough Plan, of which 
the majority are either under construction, benefit from planning permission or 
are at an advanced stage in the application process . Therefore , it is realistic 
 
25 Windfall sites only include the years 202 4 (anticipated year of adoption)  – 2039 to avoid double 
counting .   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
22 
 that the  majority of strategic sites will deliver a significant number of units over 
the next five years.  
Employment land  
 
6.30 In May 2022 the Council published the Nuneaton and Bedworth Draft H EDNA26 
to inform the Borough Plan Review Preferred Options. The employment land 
need assessment was informed by work undertaken for the emerging sub -
regional HEDNA. In line with  the PPG27,  the assessment used a range of 
modelling techniques including  labour tre nd models, floorspace trends informed 
by Valuation Office Agency statistics and completions data. In drawing 
conclusions, the assessment used the most appropriate modelling technique 
for different sectors. In the final analysis, the Draft HEDNA proposed fo r the 
period 2021 -2039 , a requirement for 82.5ha of employment land.  
 
6.31 Iceni have modelled employment land needs over the proposed plan period. 
Economic forecasts project economic growth of almost £800m between 2021 -
2039, with an increase of 5,000 jobs in the Borough. This sees employment in 
the Borough recovering to pre-pandemic levels in 2024 and growing broadly in 
line with the long -term trends, with 3,800 jobs created between 2024 -2039.  
 
6.32 Iceni’s analysis indicates a very strong demand for industrial and 
warehouse /distribution premises in the Borough over the p lan period. Utilising 
a five -year ‘completions trend’ projection, this indicates a need of 35,300m2 for 
industrial land and 293,900m2 of warehousing /distribution land. Accounting for 
a 0.5 ratio of developable land for industrial land and a 0.4 ratio for w arehousing 
and distribution, this delivers a total need of 7.1ha of industrial land and 73.5ha 
of warehousing /distribution, equating to an overall warehouse and industrial 
employment land need for Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough of 80.5ha , 
including a provis ion for strategic B8 need.  
 
6.33 Iceni’s analysis indicates relatively weak demand for office development in the 
Borough, with likely demand for occupation by small and medium sized 
enterprises. This is due to the availability of high quality  office space in other 
authority areas, with limited demand and delivery of office space in the Borough 
over the last 10 years. Iceni’s analysis estimates a potential office need for the 
Borough of 2ha up to 2039.  
 
6.34  In November 2022 the Council published, alongside other Coventry and 
Warwickshire local authorities, a sub -regional assessment of the need for 
housing, economic gr owth potential and employment land needs28. The 
outcome of the sub -regional HEDNA for the employment land requirement in 
Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough was 47.7ha (2021 -2041) or 69ha (2021 -
2050), significantly lower than that set out in the draft HEDNA. This was

 primarily due to release of the 2021  Census data and the completions data 
considering a 5 -year period rather than 10 years as in the draft HEDNA. The 
sub-regional HEDNA , in addition , identifies a need for 606ha (subsequently 
reviewed by Iceni to 436ha) of land to 2041 to accommodate the need  for 
growth of the strategic warehousing (Class B8) sector across Coventry and 
Warwickshire.  
 
6.35 ‘Towards a Housing Requirement for Nuneaton’29 was published alongside the 
sub-regional HEDNA and intended to be read alongside the findings of the sub -
regio nal HEDNA. The report takes into account the findings from the Draft 
Nuneaton and Bedworth HEDNA and other relevant local considerations 
including the economic aspirations of the Borough which need to be considered 
in setting the housing and employment target. The report recommends the Draft 
HEDNA as a suitable basis for determining employment land need as it:   
• Utilised more up -to-date employment completions data than the sub -
regional.  
• Allowed for the provision of strategic B8 warehousing and distribution.  
 
6.36 ‘Towards a Housing Requirement for Nuneaton’  followed the conclusions of the 
draft HEDNA, that 82.5ha of employment land would be  an appropriate 
minimum level of provision , including contributing to the sub -regional need for 
strategic B8 warehousing and distribution development.  
 
6.37 The NPPF30 states that planning policies and decisions should recognise and 
address the specific locational requirements of different sectors includ ing 
storage and suitably accessible locations. The PPG31 also requires that 
authorities assess the stock of land for employment uses within the area, 
patterns of supply losses, evidence of growth, market demand and market 
failure . 
 
6.38 To gain a greater understanding of employment requirements of different 
sectors and the current status of employment land, in May 2023 the Council 
commissioned Iceni Projects to review the employment land portfolio in the 
Borough32. The review assessed existing employment sites in the Borough to 
determine if the sites are of sufficient quality to serve the economic needs of 
the Borough for the duration of the Borough Plan , and if any employment land 
should be removed from the supply  portfolio. The document also brought 
together the previous HEDNA studies to determine the need for employment 
land in the Borough and to segment the contribution of strategic B8 , identified 
in the Draft HEDNA , and provide an indicative figure.

 6.39 West  Midlands Local Authorities, including Nuneaton and Bedworth, have 
commissioned a study into strategic employment sites in the area. The study 
does not attempt to override the local approach but to add value. The early 
findings of the West Midlands Strateg ic Employment Site Study identify two 
drivers of employment land need:  
• Replacement of existing strategic employment sites due to physical and 
functional obsolescence.  
• The need to accommodate growing traffic volumes over the long -term.  
• Additional larger scale sites to meet modern industry requirements.  
 
6.40 The West Midlands Strategic Employment Site Study has not reached a stage 
where a strategic employment land figure can be established or attributed to a 
Local Authority. The review of Nuneaton and Bedworth Employment Land 
Portfolio Study assessed all employment sites in the Borough and considered 
employment sites which are physically or functionally obsolete. The identified 
sites have been removed from the employment land portfolio and added to the 
overall employment land need. The HEDNA and subsequent employment land 
review identified an indicative figure for strategic B8 which will act in lieu of a 
growth figure yet to be established in the West Midlands Study.  
 
6.41 Bringing together the vario us studies, the Employment Land Portfolio Study 
calculated, over the plan period 2021 -2039, the employment land need as:  
 
  Developable Land 
(ha) 
Office needs  2 
Local Industrial and Warehouse 
needs  61.1 
Replacement provision  for site 
losses  5.35

Total employment land needed 
(2021 -2039) 87.85  
 
Table 4: Employment land need (2021 -2039).  
 
Employment land supply  
 
6.42 To understand the level of employment need in the Borough, the Council asked 
Iceni Projects to calculate the pipeline supply of employment land. The 
assessment considered:  
• Employment land completed in 2021 -22. 
• Extant planning permissions . 
• Supply from existing floorspace . 
• Vacant plots within existing employment sites . 
• Windfall potential .  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
25 
 • Extant Borough Plan allocation.  
 
6.43 In assessing extant Borough Plan allocations, the analysis was able to consider 
the actual developable area from planning applications to ensure the figure was 
the most accurate available. Supply from existing floorspace factored a 7.5% 
vacancy rate to ens ure there is a functioning market. Employment land 
completions utilised data from the Council’s Authority Monitoring Report for the 
period 2021 -22. Extant planning permissions were considered to April 2022. 
The Council’s monitoring data to April 2023 shows  34.2ha of these extant 
planning permissions and are under construction . The windfall assessment was 
based on Iceni’s analysis of gross completions of employment land within the 
Borough over the last 10 years, with a 30% reduction to ensure delivery was 
not overly reliant on windfall and  considered a reduced delivery period to ensure 
no overlap with extant planning permissions. The overall assessment 
concluded there is a total employment land supply of 107 .05ha. Subsequent to 
the Employment Land Review the Council’s A uthority Monitoring Report  to April 
2023 shows there have been 2.12ha of employment land completions. The 
completions for 2023 totalled 1.25ha, which has been removed from extant 
planning permissions and added to the overall completions figure in the Table 
5.

 Further considerations  
 
6.45 Office employment land need is modest and the viability for solely office -based 
schemes in the Borough can be challenging. Mixed use development in 
Nuneaton Town Centre , or standalone development on employment sites , are 
most likely to deliver office schem es. The Transforming Nuneaton scheme of a 
library and business centre could contribute towards office need. The site area 
totals 1.84ha and concerns the erection of 65 dwellings, a new library and 
business centre. An outline application has been submitted which is to be 
determined and so does not from part of the pipeline supply.  
 
6.46 The strategic B8 need is being met through the Faultlands development , which 
is an allocated site . There are other allocations at Wilsons Lane, Prologis 
Extension, Coventry Road  and Bowling Green Lane which could provide further 
large B8 units or smaller units for local warehouse or industrial needs . The 
details of these sites are set out in Strategic Policy DS 5 – Employment 
Allocations.  
 
6.47 The windfall allowance provides additional employment land to offer 
capacity/resilience should there be demand. It is likely that this will go towards 
meeting the needs of  small to medium sized enterprises  in the Borough.  
 
Employment Trajectory  
 
6.48 The Council will regularly review the employment trajectory and is informed by 
the findings of the employment land review33 and Housing and Economic Land  
Availability Assessment. An employment trajectory of the anticipated 
completions of development is set out in Appendix C. Delivery will not be 
consistent over the plan period as the proposed schemes  tend to deliver large 
units. The positive progress regarding planning applications is reflected in the 
trajectory , with delivery anticipated in the short to medium term.  
 
Gypsies and Travellers  
 
6.49 Under the 2004 Housing Act, the Council is required to produce an assessment 
of the current and future accommodation needs of Gypsies, Travellers and 
Travelling Showpeople, and then identify and plan for the provision of 
permanent and transit sites to meet those needs.  
 
6.50 The 2021 Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showperson Accommodation 
Assessment has been used to calculate the number of pitches and plots 
required between 2021/22 – 2036/37  and the Gypsy and Traveller Site 
Allocations DPD  (due to be adopted in 2023) uses this as the basis for setting 
out the need and where the need will be met. The accommodation assessment 
 
33 Iceni Projects (2023) . Review of Nuneaton & Bedworth Employment Land Portfolio .  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
27 
 will be updated every five ye ars and these subsequent updates will be used to 
calculate the number of pitches and plots required in the future and, if 
necessary, these will in turn be used to update this separate DPD.  
 
Cemetery Land  
 
6.51 The Burial Space Capacity Data (November 2022) identified there is insufficient 
burial space capacity to meet the Borough’s needs over the plan period. It is 
therefore proposed that land is allocated for burial space over the plan period 
and beyond. This is address further in Strategic Policy CEM1.

• The site is a former playing field and other leisure uses, located to the east of 
Bedworth Road. The site benefits from resolution to grant full permission 
subject to the signing of a S106 Agreement for 122 dwellings  (Application 
reference 038716).  
 
• The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment  (SFRA)  Level 2 ( August  2023) provided 
for the Borough Plan Review required the site to undergo  a full Level 2 
assessment. The site is within Flood Zone s 1 and 2  and the report states that 
safe access and egress will need to be demonstrated in flood events and that 
site drainage proposals should avoid impeding surface water flows and 
preserve the st orage of surface water to avoid exacerbation of flood risk in the 
wider catchment. The document should be considered as part of the further 
site-specific flood -risk assessment  that will be required with any planning 
application. The Report concluded that S equential and Exception Tests are 
required for this site.  
 
NSRA2: Former Manor Park Community School  
 
• Site Area: 2.3ha . 
• Dwellings: 123 . 
• Alternative Site Reference: ABB -4.

31 
  
• The site is a former community school located in a primarily residential area. It 
adjoins Beaumont Road and Vernons Lane. The site benefits from outline 
permission for 46 houses, 12 flats and 65 extra -care units (Application 
reference 035587  – November 202 2). 
 
• Opportunity exists to create a new positive frontage to Vernons Lane, retain 
views from the north of the site towards Mount Judd, retain established trees 
and boundary hedges wherever possible, ensure development is sensitive to 
its location adjacent to the conservation area, that development reflects the 
characteristics of the surrounding townscape and that built development sits 
outside the small area of flood zone located in the south of the site.  
 
• Development should seek to avoid any loss of trees  covered under the Tree 
Preservation Order on the site (reference TPO 1.19).  
 
NSRA3: West of Coventry Road /Wilson Lane  
 
• Site Area: 2.9ha . 
• Dwellings: 95 . 
• Alternative Site Reference: EXH -3.

32 
  
• The site is located to the south of Bedworth and formed part of HSG6 – School 
Lane in the Borough Plan (2011 -2031), which was adopted in 2019.  
 
• The site benefits from a resolution to grant full permission subject to the signing 
of a S106 Agreement for 95 dwellings (Application reference 039136) . 
 
• Opportunities exist to retain established trees within any proposed development 
and retain and enhance  existing hedgerows. Where development is required to 
be set back from electricity pylons in the south of the site, this space could be 
used to establish a landscape buffer to include retained and proposed planting. 
Finally, woodland and tree planting coul d be included to reduce the 
development’s prominence within the landscape.  
 
• The SFRA  Level 2 (August 2023) report , provided for the Borough Plan Review, 
flags the site as at low flood risk and there are no areas within Flood Zones 2 
or 3. However, the Repo rt identifies there is some minor surface water ponding 
and the report states that safe access and egress will need to be demonstrated 
in flood events.  This document should be referred to and be considered as part 
of the further site -specific flood -risk a ssessment that will be required for the site 
with any planning application.   
 
• Responses from the Infrastructure Delivery Scheme (IDS) , for the Borough Plan 
Review , include requirements for contributions specific to HSG6 (which this site 
was previously within) : 
 
 Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
33 
 o Contributions to National Grid  for the site to pay for 11kV, 33kV and 
132k V diversions and new primary substation.  
o S106 contributions f or Warwickshire Police towards Bedworth Police 
station . 
o The pr ovision and contribution of formal and  informal open space and

Recreation Ground community park and Miners Welfare Park, towards 
the management and enhancement of the retained biodiversity areas 
and towards proposed informal open space for management and 
maintenance arrangements.  
o A financial contribution  towards primary education at local school s 
(expansion required for Newdigate Primary School). Additionally 
provision for early years, secondary (expansion of Ash Green School), 
SEND and post -16 as req uired.  
o GP expansion at Bedworth for 0.82 GPs and likely extension to 
Bedworth Health Centre, Leicester Road Surgery or Old Cole House

• Site Area: 1.2ha . 
• Dwellings: 65 . 
• Alternative Site Reference: ABB -8.  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
34 
  
• The site consists of Nuneaton Library, car parks and vacant land. The site is 
bound by the A444 to the south and east, Leicester Road to the north and 
Justice Walk to the west.  
 
There is currently an outstanding outline planning application for the site for the 
erection of  a new Library and Business Centre and up to 65 residential 
dwellings (Application reference 039175).  
 
• The site has significant potential to connect the existing green infrastructure, 
from the south and west, to the north leading to the railway station and  the 
ecological corridor of the rail network. Landscaping will be important to achieve 
biodiversity net gain as well as meet urban climate change mitigation 
objectives. Such features may include green roofs and walls.  
 
• The SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) , provided for the Borough Plan Review , 
required the site to undergo a full Level 2 assessment. The site is within Flood 
Zones 1 and 2.  The Report referred to fluvial flooding and ponding in flood 
events . The Level 2 Assessment concluded that s ite drainage proposals should 
demonstrate the requirements for safe access/egress including allowances for 
climate change , and that drainage must avoid impeding surface water flows and 
preserve the storage of surface water to avoid exacerbation of flood risk i n the 
wider catchment. The document should be considered as part of the further 
site-specific flood -risk assessment that will be required for any planning 
application. The Report concluded that a Sequential Test is required for this 
site.

 NSRA5: Land rear of Burbages Lane, Ash Green  
 
• Site Area: 1.6ha . 
• Dwellings: 47 . 
• Alternative Site Reference: EXH -8. 
 
• The site comprises of a pasture enclosed by hedges and trees, along with part 
of the rear residential gardens of properties off Burbages Lane.  
 
• Where possible existing established trees, particularly to the site boundaries, 
should be retained, and enhance d planting to site boundaries, especially to the 
eastern boundary, should be implemented to strengthen the settlement 
boundary. The existing public right of way should be incorporated into the layout 
of any proposed development.  
 
• It will be important to es tablish the size of the slow worm population and how 
these important and rare species in Warwickshire can be protected and 
enhanced on the site and in the wider environment.  
 
• The SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) , provided for the Borough Plan Review, flags 
the site as at low flood risk . The site is within Flood Zone 1 . The Report identifie d 
some ponding during flood events  which could limit access/egress to the site. 
The document should be referred to and be consi dered as part of the further 
site-specific flood -risk assessment that will be required for the site with any 
planning application .

 • Responses from the IDS, for the Borough Plan Review , includes requirements 
for contributions specific to this site for Warwickshire Police for additional 
personnel, vehicles and increased capacity at Bedworth Police Station.  
 
NSRA6: Land at Bucks Hill, Nuneaton  
 
• Site Area: 1.9ha . 
• Dwellings: 40 . 
• Alternative Site Reference: CAM -1. 
 
• The site is situated between Bucks Hill Road and Eden Court in the Chapel End 
areas of Nuneaton.  
 
• Given the topography of the site careful consideration needs to be given to the 
design of any development.  
 
• The SFRA Lev el 2 (August 2023) , provided for the Borough Plan Review, 
required the site to undergo a full Level 2 assessment. The site is within Flood 
Zone 1, but the report flags the site as having some surface water risk and 
ponding during flood events.  Site drainage proposals should address the 
requirements for access routes, avoid impeding surface water flows and 
preserve the storage of surface water to av oid exacerbation of flood risk in the 
wider catchment. Development proposals at the site must address the potential 
changes associated with climate change and be designed to be safe for the 
intended lifetime. The provisions for safe access and egress must also address 
the potential increase in severity and frequency of flooding. The document 
 Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
37 
 should be referred to and be considered as part of the further site -specific flood -
risk assessment that will be required for the site with any planning application.  
The Report concluded that both Sequential and Exception Tests are required 
for this site.  
 
NSRA7: Abbey Street, Nuneaton  
 
• Site Area: 2.4ha . 
• Dwellings: 30 . 
• Alternative Site Reference: ABB -6. 
 
• The site is located in Nuneaton Town Centre between Abbey Street and 
Queen’s Road and is bound to the west by the A444. The land comprises of a 
car park, commercial buildings and underdeveloped land.  
 
• The site benefits from : 
o Full consent for a hotel and c ar parking and outline permission for 30 
dwellings, mixed town centre uses including flexible use for retail, 
leisure, restaurants and ‘makers space’, medical uses (Class E), 
multistorey/surface car parking and public plaza (Application reference 
037658 – Approved January 2022).  
o Part of the site has also received Reserved Matters for the erection of a 
food hall and flexible Class E space and residential development of 30 
dwellings (Application reference 039160 – Approved May 2023).  
o Full consent for the partial demolition and refurbishment of existing 
buildings and the erection of a digital skills and innovation centre to

38 
 include further education college, ancillary uses and a public restaurant 
(Application reference 038706 - January 2 023).  
o There is also an outstanding reserved matters application for the site for 
flexible Class E or Cinema and flexible Class E (Application reference 
039519) . 
 
• The site presents the opportunity to green the urban fabric of Nuneaton through 
landscaping. Such opportunities include green roofs, landscape planting and 
green walls. The site presents the opportunity to link the Nuneaton Recreation 
Ground with the town centre, and potential to link with the urban renewal project 
further to the east . 
 
 
• The SFRA Level 2 (August 2023) , provided for the Borough Plan Review, 
required the site to undergo a full Level 2 assessment. The site is within Flood 
Zones 1, 2 and 3 and the report flags the site as having some ground, fluvial 
and surface water risk and ponding and a small section is within the 
Environment Agency Flood Warning Area. Site drainage proposals should 
address the requirements for access routes, avoid impeding surface water 
flows and preserve the storage of surface water to avoid exacerbati on of flood 
risk in the wider catchment.  Development proposals at the site must address 
the potential changes associated with climate change and be designed to be 
safe for the intended lifetime. The provisions for safe access and egress must 
also address the potential increase in severity and frequency of flooding. The 
document should be referred to and be considered as part of the further site -
specific flood -risk assessment that will be required for the site with any planning

border between the administrative boundaries of Nuneaton  and Bedworth and 
North Warwickshire . 
 
• The access to the site is located within the North Warwickshire Council 
boundary. The development within Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council 
benefits from a resolution to grant outline permission subject to the signing of a 
S106 Agreement for 29 dwelling s (Application reference 038144).  
 
• Opportunities exist to set development back from Bar Pool Brook to protect its 
function as a wildlife corridor and to continue a sense of undeveloped character 
along the valley bottom. The existing public right of way sho uld be retained and 
integrated within any proposed development and existing vegetation should be 
retained wherever possible. New tree planting should be used to soften the 
appearance of any development, complementary habitats should be provided 
adjacent to  Bar Pool Brook and any open space proposed, within the site, 
should link harmoniously with that at Nuneaton Common.  
 
• The SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) , provided for the Borough Plan Review, 
required the site to undergo a full Level 2 assessment. The site is within Flood 
Zones 1, 2 and 3 and the report flags the site as having some fluvial flood risk 
and significant surface water. The provisions for safe access and egress must 
also address the potential increase in severity and frequency of flooding. The 
document should be referred to and be considered as part of the further site -

• Site Area: 0.9ha . 
• Dwellings: 25 . 
• Alternative Site Reference: ARB -1. 
 
• The site is partially community use and partially vacant land. Due to previous 
land uses in the area (Bermuda Landfill Site - a former landfill site that accepted 
waste material) there may be potential for landfill gas to be generated. 
Developers may be re quired to carry out a comprehensive risk assessment due 
to the risks the former landfill site poses. The local authority's Environmental 
Health and Building Control departments would wish to ensure that any threats 
from landfill gas have been adequately ad dressed in the proposed 
development.  
 
• The site has planning consent for a GP surgery (Application reference 031064). 
Any application will need to demonstrate that there is no longer a need for this.  
 
• The Phoenix Centre will be retained and car parking re configured to 
accommodate new residential development.  
 Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
42 
  
• Any re -provisioning of car parking should not take place on the adjoining playing 
field land nor should the proposed residential development prejudice the use of 
the playing field site in accordance with Sports England requirements.  
 
• Opportunities exist to retain existing drainage features and associated 
vegetation in the west of the site. New hedgerows should be introduced to the 
site to provide structure to the landscape and new habitats and linkage s should 
be provided to the public right of way to the east and open space to the north. 
Any open space or car park within the development should have pedestrian 
links to community facilities to the north and appropriate landscape treatment.  
 
• The site has local ecological value, that if managed sensitively, has the potential 
to become of county importance in the short -term. The Bermuda Phoenix 
Recreation Ground also has this potential.  
 
• Maintain and enhance the connectivity between Harefield L ane with the 
Bridleway.  
 
• The SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) , provided for the Borough Plan Review , 
required the site to undergo a full Level 2 assessment . This was due to its 
proximity to Griff Brook (which currently has no hydraulic modelling) and 
cumulative impact with the Strategic Housing Allocation of the Arbury site 
(SHA2). The site is within Flood Zone 1. The Report flags the site as having 
surface water risk for some a nnual exceedance probabilit ies. The Report also 
states that safe access and egress wil l need to be demonstrated in the 1% AEP 
plus climate change surface water and fluvial events and that site drainage 
proposals should address the requirements for access routes, avoid impeding 
surface water flows and preserve the storage of surface water to  avoid 
exacerbation of flood risk in the wider catchment. The document should be 
referred to and be considered as part of the further site -specific flood -risk 
assessment that will be required for the site with any planning application.  The

Strategic Policy DS6 – Green Belt  
 
 
Development in the Green Belt  
To ensure the Green Belt across the Borough continues to serve its fundamental 
aim and purpose, and maintains its essential characteristics, it will be protected by 
restricting development to only that which is considered by national planning policy 
as not inappropriate Green Belt development, except where very special 
circumstances can be demonstrated.  
 
Proposals on previously developed sites in the Green Belt will be restricted to the 
limited infilling and redevelopment of previously developed land and  will be 
assessed in accordance with national planning policy.  
 
Any development proposals considered not inappropriate for locating within the 
Green Belt should demonstrate how their plans will retain the five key purposes of 
the Green Belt. Any proposed d evelopment in the Green Belt will need to maintain 
openness and demonstrate compensatory improvements to the environmental 
quality and accessibility of the land.  
 
Opportunities to enhance the beneficial use of the Green Belt will be approved, 
including op portunities to provide access, provide outdoor sport and recreation, 
retain and enhance landscapes, provide visual amenity and biodiversity, or to 
improve derelict or damaged land.  
 
 
6.65 Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough sits within the wider West Midlands G reen 
Belt which was initially established in 1975 and covers almost 1 ,500sq.m . 
surrounding the Black Country, Coventry, Birmingham and Solihull. The 
Borough contains large amounts of Green Belt land, most of which is located 
to the south of Nuneaton, and also surrounds the main areas of Bedworth, 
Bulkington and Ash Green.  
 
6.66 Nationally, the Government attaches great importance to the Green Belt, which 
serves the main goal of preventing urban sprawl and keeping land permanently 
open.  
 
6.67 The five key purposes of Green Belts are:  
 
• to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built -up areas.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
51 
 • to prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another.  
• to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment.  
• to preserve the setting and special c haracter of historic towns.  
• to assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and 
other urban land.  
 
Alterations to the Green Belt boundary  
 
6.68 Alterations to the Green Belt boundary are only approved in exceptional 
circumstances and must be done during the local plan making process.  
 
6.69 For the adopted Borough Plan (2019), Green Belt release was considered 
necessary to meet the overall housing and employment needs determined at 
the time. The objectively assessed need for the Borough, which was informed 
by demographic based need, supporting economic growth, improving 
affordability and accommodating overspill from Coventry’s unmet need, 
delivered an average housing need figure of 735 dwellings per annum. Based 
on the limited capacity /few approved planning applications available and the 
need to deliver a sustainable development strategy for the Borough with the 
Coventry overspill, the Inspector considered that there were exceptional 
circumstances to justify Green Belt release at the time. The main evidence base 
used to base decisions on Green Belt release was the Joint Green Belt Study, 
which assessed all Green Belt parcels in the sub -region and the contribution 
they made to the five purposes of the Green Belt as set out in national guidance.  
 
6.70 Sites that were released from the Gr een Belt through the 2019 Borough Plan 
offer significant housing and employment capacity for the Borough Plan Review 
plan period. Having regard to those sites, existing permissions, sites submitted 
through the Call for Sites process and the up -to-date asse ssment of housing 
need, it is considered that exceptional circumstances do not exist to justify 
further Green Belt release.   
 
6.71 One of the sites to the east of Bulkington, released from the Green Belt through 
the adopted Borough Plan, is no longer proposed to be allocated for residential 
development as part of the Borough Plan Review. A New Green Belt Technical 
Report has been prep ared to establish whether there are exceptional 
circumstances to justifying the designation of sites removed from the Green 
Belt as part of the Borough Plan as Green Belt. The report concluded that in 
line with national policy no exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated to 
create new Green Belt given that the development management policies within 
the adopted plan, which are retained in the Borough Plan Review, are 
sufficiently strong to resist development outside of settlement boundaries. 
Therefore, i t is not proposed that the Green Belt boundaries around Bulkington 
are altered as Strategic Policy DS2 – settlement hierarchy and roles , which sets 
the parameters for acceptable development located inside and outside of 
settlement boundaries, will apply to  any development proposals.  
 
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
52 
 Development in the remaining Green Belt  
 
6.72 Inappropriate development is harmful to the Green Belt and should not be 
considered except in very special circumstances. Very special circumstances 
will not exist unless the potential harm to the Green Belt by reason of 
inappropriateness, and any other harm, is clearly outweighed by other 
considerations.  
 
6.73 Types of development that may not be deemed inappropriate within the Green 
Belt include those which are considered ess ential to:  
 
• Agriculture and forestry.  
• Cemeteries and burial grounds.  
• Allotments.  
• Outdoor recreation and outdoor sport.  
• Extensions or alterations to buildings that would not result in 
disproportionate additions to the original building.  
• The replacement of a building, provided that the new building is for the 
same use, is not materially larger than the one that it replaces and will have 
no greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt.  
• Limited infilling in villages or the partial or complet e redevelopment of 
previously developed land, whether redundant or in continuing use 
(excluding temporary buildings), providing no greater impact on openness.

Policy DS 7 – Monitoring of housing delivery  
 
 
The Council will monitor the delivery of housing and publish progress against the 
trajectory  (as shown in A ppendix B). Where  it is apparent that delivery rates are 
falling short of what was anticipated, then the Council will take the necessary action 
to address any shortfall. Such action may include (but are not limited to):  
 
• Working with developers and site promoters, particul arly of the two largest 
strategic sites, to review the requirements and phasing of infrastructure 
provision, where such re -phasing would assist with viability.  
• Working with developers, site promoters and other interested parties to help 
unlock potential so urces of funding for identified infrastructure, or;  
o considering the use of compulsory purchase powers to help address 
known land acquisition issues; or  
o bringing forward additional sites where it can be demonstrated that 
such sites will assist with delivery  to address short -term needs.  
 
Where additional housing sites need to be brought forward, initial priority will be 
given to sustainable sites, including town centre redevelopment opportunities in 
Nuneaton and edge of settlement sites, unless the adverse im pacts of doing so 
would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits.  
 
 
Policy DS 8 – Review  
 
 
The plan will be reviewed (either wholly or partly) in accordance with the 
requirements set out in national  guidance. In the event of one or more of the 
following circumstances, a quicker review may be required:  
 
• If there is clear evidence that the Borough’s lo cal housing need or 
employment need has changed significantly since the adoption of the  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
54 
 plan. Updated evidence or changes to national policy suggest that the 
overall development strategy should be significantly changed.  
• Any other reason that would render t he plan, or part of it, significantly out 
of date.  
 
 
6.78 The Council acknowledges that there could be changes to Local Plan guidance 
and regulations which may see the need for an early review of this plan, or that 
such a review could be required because of planning circumstances in the 
Coventry and Warwickshire Housing Market Area. Current Government 
guidance requires that plan reviews should be completed no later than five 
years from plan adoption.

 7.0 Strategic allocations  
 
7.1 Policies have been developed for each of the strategic site allocations to outline 
the specific requirements at each site. A strategic policy also outlines the 
requirements which apply to all strategic site allocations.  
 
7.2 The site -specific policies establish a strategic context for planning ap plications 
and set a baseline position in terms of assessing future schemes which will 
contain more detailed proposals.  
 
7.3  They also ensure that development is brought forward in a strategic and 
comprehensive manner. Alternative solutions and land use arrangements may 
come forward as part of the planning application process, but these should 
explain the reasons for any significant differences in approach.  
 
7.4 The site -specific policies establish the following matters for each site:  
 
• Land uses.  
• Development principles.  
• Infrastructure delivery.  
• Form of development.  
 
7.5 The work undertaken to prepare the strategic policies has identified the key 
infrastructure and amenity requirements for each of the sites and the outcomes 
of this have been summari sed within the policies. The infrastructure provision 
has been informed by discussions with key stakeholders and service providers 
such as Warwickshire County Council’s Education and Highways departments, 
Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council and the  NHS C oventry and 
Warwickshire Integrated Care Board (ICB). The IDP sets out details on these 
on-site items and the cumulative impact of development which will be expected 
to be fulfilled by each site.  
 
7.6  Detailed site concept plans exist for some of the strategic sites and should be 
used in conjunction with the policies where relevant.  In addition, after the 
adoption of the Borough Plan Review, the Council’s SPDs will be reviewed , but 
in the interim they remain valid and are relevant to the strategic sites where they 
are consistent with new Borough Plan policy.  
   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
56 
 Strategic Policy SA1 – Development principles on 
strategic sites  
 
 
Proposals on all strategic sites will meet the follow ing requirements:  
 
1. Residential development must meet 95% M4(2) and 5% M4(3) Building 
Regulations standards for access, the Nationally Described Space Standards  
and the principles  set out within the relevant SPD s (including Building for a 
Healthy Life and t he Future Homes and Buildings Standard , where technically 
and financially feasible). F or non -residential buildings, BREAAM 
requirements  or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)  
standards should be complied with  (where technically and financially 
feasible ). Where assessment methods are changed or superseded, the 
appropriate replacement standards will be used.  
2. Landscape features and blue infrastructure should be incorporated into the 
scheme design and areas of open space, rather than separate areas of 
isolated green space, existing internal hedgerow trees, hedgerows and 
specimen trees should be retained and enhanced as well as habitat corridors 
and green infrastructure pedestrian /cycle routes. Development should 
provide appropriate trees including street trees, orchards of mixed native 
species and make use of stepping stones  to provide a wider connection for 
habitat in relation to trees, wooded areas and grassland.  
3. Existing watercou rses and drainage ditches, which can provide vital corridors 
for wildlife and be useful in providing available outfalls of surface water 
connections, to avoid future connections into the combined sewer network, 
should be protected.  
4. Appropriate siting of b uilt form to create variation and use of varied materials 
to further breakup the mass of development in views.  
5. Maximise the use of sustainable materials including green roofs and living 
walls.  
6. Heritage assets should be conserved and enhanced, with focus placed on 
the assets most at risk from neglect, decay or other threats.  
7. Potential  local wildlife sites within or affecting the site will be surveyed for 
their ecological importance whilst designated local wildlife sites will be 
protected.  
8. Areas of high di stinctiveness (value 6) should be retained and enhanced34 
along with other habitat retention, creation and enhancement required to 
achieve a minimum of 10% net biodiversity gain. Existing high quality 
biodiversity features must be retained and enhanced, in cluding financial 
contributions for long -term management.  
9. Existing public right s of way  must be incorporated into green /open space 
networks wherever possible and new pedestrian and cycle links should be 
included to provide linkages to the wider area. If these cycle links require the 
use of the existing adopted highway or are to be offered for highway adoption,

 these should accord with Warwickshire County Council’s design guide and 
current national guidance. Secure cycle parking and shaded areas, to allow 
cooling for users, should also be provided.  
10. Doors and windows to housing should overlook all streets and public spaces 
in order to provide natural surveillance.  
11. On sites where ridge and furrow is present, green spaces should be 
positioned so as to retain these areas wherever possible.  
12. Community, sport, physical activity, play and open space facilities should 
relate well to e ach other and to existing areas, and the new facilities and 
spaces should be safe, convenient, accessible, well designed, easy to 
maintain and function well. Proposals shall be assessed against Sport 
England’s Active Design Guidance and its checklist.  
13. New proposals will need to ensure that the development includes 
fundamental mitigation for climate change, carbon reduction leading to 
neutral carbon emissions by 2050 and for a nature recovery strategy. For 
example, new developments should be built in line wi th water resource 
efficient design standards (110 litres /person /day).  
14. In the event of a part submission of a strategic site, the proposal will need to 
illustrate that the applicant has worked with owners of the other parts of the 
allocation in order to ens ure the entire site will ultimately provide a cohesive 
scheme, including contiguous linkages without ransom strips to ensure the 
allocation can be provided in their entirety. Any infrastructure provided within 
a staged submission such as road widths and vi sibility splays must be 
suitable for the provision of the entire allocation.  
15. Service bays on employment sites, adjacent to housing, will need to have 
loading areas set away from residential properties or any other sensitive 
noise receptors and car parks a t least 50m from residential properties.  
16. Proposals should comply with the requirements of the relevant Concept Plan 
SPD and Design Code for the site (where extant /adopted).  
 
Where any of the requirements of this policy or those in the site -specific polic ies are 
deemed unviable, an independent viability assessment must be submitted with the 
planning application.  
 
 
Landscape and open space  
 
7.7 The Council’s adopted open space and green infrastructure SPD will provide a 
basis for open space, landscape and biodiversity requirements35. The 
development of each of the strategic allocations will seek to incorporate existing 
landscape features into are as of open space where possible. Retention of 
existing boundary woodland, trees and hedgerows will form a base to enhance 
site landscape buffers where proposed.  
 
7.8 Existing features, green spaces for landscaping and informal open space will 
be incorpora ted into each of the proposed housing allocations. The usable 
green space will be located to provide areas of either community parks or local 
parks, linked by a network of footpath and cycle routes. Areas with biodiversity

 value should be protected , buffer ed from noise and busy through flow , to retain 
ecological functionality.  
 
Edge treatments  
 
7.9 Existing boundary hedgerows will be retained and strengthened. These trees 
and hedgerows will form an integrated part of scheme design rather than 
separate area s of isolated green space. The boundary of each site will be 
designed to form a defensible boundary.  
 
Biodiversity  
 
7.10  Existing high quality biodiversity features will be retained and enhanced as part 
of the overall development of each of the strategic sites, including financial 
contributions for long -term management. Development proposals being 
brought forward on each of the strategic allocations , will be accompanied by an 
ecological assessment that will confirm how each site will deliver a mi nimum of 
10% net biodiversity gain and will make use of Warwickshire County Council’s 
biodiversity offsetting metrics until such time this is superseded by the 
mandatory use of the national metrics.    
 
7.11 The development of each of the strategic allocat ions will seek to create areas 
of greenspace to enhance existing habitats on the site. Sustainable drainage 
system  (SuDS)  features should also be utilised as potential wildlife habitat.  
 
Footpaths and cycleways  
 
7.12 Opportunities should be pursued to enha nce and develop new footpath and 
cycleway links as part of new housing and mixed -use development, in order to 
improve connectivity between the site and the local area. An internal network 
of paths will be required linking key destinations and entrance poin ts, and the  
delivery of infrastructure or contributions, as agreed by Warwickshire County 
Council, will be required to the cycle network linking to the site, in accordance 
with Warwickshire County Council’s Cycle Network Development Plan for the 
Borough.  
 
Movement and highway access, including wider road improvements  
 
7.13 Planning must support a pattern of development which facilitates and promotes 
the use of sustainable modes of transport . The Strategic Transport Assessment  
(2023) , prepared by Wa rwickshire County Council , is a document which 
considers the potential impacts of all proposed strategic housing and 
employment allocations within the Borough until 2039. This assessment sets 
out a number of strategic road improvements for each of the stra tegic 
allocations and /or the local area.  
 
7.14 The submission of a transport assessment will be required as part of any 
planning application to develop each of the strategic allocations, alongside 
some of the non -strategic residential sites. The transport  assessment will also 
identify what measures will be taken to deal with the anticipated transport  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
59 
 impacts of the scheme, and to improve accessibility and safety for all modes of 
travel, maximising alternatives to the car such as walking, cycling and public  
transport.  
 
7.15 Any transport improvements /upgrades required by the strategic transport 
assessment or transport assessment will be secured by planning condition 
attached to the  grant of any planning permission. The development of each of 
the strategic allocations may also be expected to contribute financially towards 
wider road improvement schemes, proposed within the Borough, during the 
development plan period, in order to ensur e that the local highway network is 
able to accommodate all strategic housing and employment  sites.  
 
Surface water drainage and flooding  
 
7.16 Environment Agency mapping has indicated that parts of the strategic 
allocations, usually following existing field drainage ditches, have a higher 
potential risk from surface water flooding. In order to ensure that the 
development of these sites remains at  low risk of flooding and does not increase 
the risk of flooding elsewhere, the development of each of the strategic 
allocations will need to include a comprehensive SuDS scheme.  
 
7.17 All of the sites have undergone a SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) as part of  the 
Borough Plan Review.  
 
Community, sports and physical activity facilities  
 
7.18 The provision of new facilities or the enhancement of existing facilities will be 
brought forward as part of each of the strategic allocations.  
 
7.19 These facilities will include, but are not limited to, local centres, community 
halls, sports and physical activity facilities, play and  open space provision and 
playing pitches within the Council’s Open Space Strategy and Playing Pitch and 
Outdoor Sports Strategy  
 
7.20 Sport, physical activity, play and open space facilities should relate well to each 
other and to existing areas, and the new facilities and spaces should be safe, 
convenient, accessible, well designed, easy to maintain and function well.  
 
7.21 The sports and physical activity facilities, identified in the housing site -specific 
policies as requiring contributions , have all been justified through relevant 
strategies, have been costed and contributions from each housing site have 
been calculated . Details of the justification for the sports facilities, their costs 
and Community Infrastructure regulation compliance is provided in the IDP.  
 
7.22 If it is unviable to provide facilities on site, then financial contributions to 
enhance or expand existing local facilities will be sought.   
 
 
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
60 
 Education requirements  
 
7.23 Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough has a two tier education system of primary 
and secondary schools. Educational requirements have been based on 
sufficient school provision being available to meet the overall housing numbers 
proposed with the strategic housing allocations.  
 
7.24 New school provision will be met either by the expansion o f existing school 
facilities or the development of new facilities on the strategic sites. The 
developers of each of the strategic allocations are encouraged to engage in 
dialogue early, with the local education authority, in order to determine what 
level o f financial contributions are required towards school expansions to 
address the demand for school places.  
 
Safety and security  
 
7.25 Design has a crucial role in delivering a safe and secure environment in 
residential areas. Natural surveillance should be provided in the form of doors 
and windows to housing overlooking streets, public spaces and parking areas, 
with the creation of an environment which is legible to residents and visitors 
alike. Existing and proposed footpaths shall be  clear and legible to promote 
their active use.  
 
7.26  Evidence must be submitted regarding how the principles of Secured By Design 
have been incorporated into the design (both residential and commercial 
applications).  
 
Noise and air quality  
 
7.27 The development of each of the strategic allocations will need to take account 
of potential noise from neighbouring uses and road traffic noise. The precise 
nature of noise mitigation measures on each site will be established through the 
undertaking of a Noise Impact Assessment. Air quality mitigation will be 
required as per the outcomes of the assessment and requirements within the 
Council’s adopted Air Quality SPD36.    
 
7.28 If required, suitable noise mitigation should be incorporated into any proposed 
informal open space or landscape buffer.  
 
Housing densities  
 
7.29 The dwelling numbers for each site are based on an overall net density of 35 
dwellings per hectare of the dev elopable land on each site. Some of the site -
specific policies have noted where alternative densities would be suitable due 
to site specific circumstances.

  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
63 
 Form of development  
 
24. Incorporate the Change Brook and existing public right of way (N29) within 
the green /open space network.  
25. Local informal public open space along the northern edge of the development 
along with appropriate landscape treatment. Dwellings should address the 
open space from the south.  
26. Use lower densities and 1 - 2 storey dwellings toward the northern edge of 
development with a maximum height of 3 storeys , located toward the existing 
urban edge.  
27. Lower densities concentrated toward the new urban edge.  
28. Retain visual presence of historic farmsteads (particularly from the urban 
edge) and where possible retain a buffer of fields in order to preserve the 
isolated character.  
29. A historic building appraisal will need to be undertaken where development 
will affect a historic farmstead.  
30. The southern boundary should complement the Coronation Walk that adjoins 
the boundary.  
31. Green spaces should reflect the irregular field p atterns and boundaries.  
32. Ponds should be retained and more created , to secure the adjacent great 
crested newts population. These ponds should be connected using suitable 
habitats such as sustainable urban drainage features, hedgerows and their 
margins.  
33. Enhance the National Cycle Route 52 /Weddington Country Walk local wild life 
site with regards to access, ecological function and historic setting.  
34. There is strong east -west connectivity along various hedgerows within the 
proposed area , and these should be retained and enhanced in order to form 
green infrastructure corridors t hroughout the site.  
35. Protected species surveys will be required, with their habitat requirements 
retained, as well as their connectivity enhanced within any development 
layout.  
36. Development will be required to come forward in accordance with the HSG1 
concept  plan above, as well as the extant HSG1 Concept Plan SPD.  
 
 
7.31 The SHA 1 site will deliver 1,700 new dwellings in a mix of sizes and tenures. 
The site is currently in single ownership and adjoins a number of sites with 
planning approvals for new houses accessed off Weddington Road to the west 
and Higham Lane to the east . The p olicy seeks to ensure that the development 
of the allocation, whilst the subject of individual applications, will be brought 
forward in an integrated manner in order to deliver wider community and 
infrastructure benefits for existing and future residents i n the north Nuneaton 
area. The allocation is likely to be delivered on a phased basis across the plan 
period and progressed by various developers.  
7.32 The site benefits from outline permission for residential dwellings, a mixed -use 
district centre with c ommunity and/or health centre uses , a primary school plus 
land safeguarded for a secondary school and 6th form, green infrastructure , 
open spaces, children’s play areas,  allotments and drainage (Application 
reference 035279  – November 2022 ). An application has been submitted for 
the northern link road ( Application  reference 039578).   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
64 
 Transport and access  
 
7.33 A new distributor link road through the allocation will be provided to include 
primary access points from Higham Lane through to Weddi ngton Road. This 
should be delivered in line with the indicative route shown on the above concept 
plan. The start and end points have already been provided as part of extant 
planning permissions in these areas. New bus infrastructure will also be 
required.  The width of the main distributor road within the development site 
must be sufficient to cater for two -way bus movement, in order to allow effective 
penetration of the site. The distributor road should ensure that:  
 
• all households within the individual developments are within 400m of a bus 
stop. 
• a highway link connects all the separate developments to each other and 
also the adjoining local highway network . 
• the minimum width of the road is 6.75m to effectively cater for bus turn 
movements in o rder to complement flexible bus routing options.  
 
7.34 The Transport Modelling Report , commissioned by Warwickshire County 
Council , sets out a number of strategic road improvements in order to mitigate 
potential cumulative impacts of all proposed strategic housing and employment 
allocations within the Borough Plan. The development of the site is expected to 
contribute financially towards t he Nuneaton area road improvement schemes , 
set out in the Transport Modelling Report, via planning obligation.  
 
School provision  
 
7.35 A key aspect of the allocation will be the delivery of new amenity facilities, 
including school provision to meet the edu cational needs of future residents 
and existing residents in the north Nuneaton area.  
 
District centres  
 
7.36 The proposed allocation will bring forward a district centre. The centre will 
provide important local services /facilities (including GP provision) for residents 
and, in turn, reduce the need to travel.  
 
Open space and green infrastructure  
 
7.37 The residential development will be integrated with informal open space that 
either forms an extension to existing areas or consists of new community parks. 
Green linkages and paths between the areas of open space and the public right 
of way network will be incorporated within, and through, the residential areas.  
 
Flood risk  
 
7.38 The SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) , provided for the Borough Plan Review, 
required the site to undergo  a full Level 2 assessment. The site is within Flood 
Zone s 1, 2 and 3 . The Report states that s afe access and egress will need to 
be demonstrated in the 1% AEP plus climate change fluvial a nd surface water  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan

 flood events  with the flood -risk assessment  required as part of planning 
applications for the site. The document should be referred to with any formal 
planning application. The Report concluded that both S equential and Exception 
Tests are required for this site.  
 
 
Strategic Policy SHA2 – Arbury  
 
Introduction  
 
7.39 Strategic housing allocation SHA2 (Arbury) is located on the southwestern 
boundary of Nuneaton and forms part of the Arbury Estate. The strategic site 
covers approximately 86ha and is bordered by residential buildings to the north 
and east, with undeveloped areas of the Arbury Estate and park to the west 
and south.  
 
 
 
Strategic Policy SHA2 – Arbury  
 
Strategic housing allocation SHA2 will be developed for a mix of residential, schools 
and community uses.  
  
Key development principles  
 
1. Provision of at least 1,525 dwellings in a mix of dwelling types and sizes.  
 Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
66 
 2. Financial contribution to the NHS Coventry and Warwickshire  ICB including 
extension to GP Surgeries.  
3. Provision of a local centre, including community facilities.  
4. Community Park , Ballcourt MUGA and older and younger children’s 
equipped play provision  (including the proposed strategic play area) to be 
provided,  forming an open space and habitat corridor linking Ensor’s Pool 
and the local wildlife sites to the south, as well as appropriate management 
and maintenance arrangements.  
5. Provision of a distributor link road through the site with integrated 
footway /cyclew ay provision in accordance with the concept plan. The 
distributor link road will need to secure a connection that links the site to the 
A444.  
6. Provision of a 1 form entry primary school but capable of expansion to 2 forms 
of entry (420 pupils)  and funding, including provision for early years , 
secondary, SEND and post -16.  
7. Provision of footway /cycleway linkages to the existing footway /cycleway 
network, including linkage to Bermuda Road bus stops and Bermuda Park 
Station . This is to provide a tarmac fully lit sustainable link route constructed 
to Highways adoptable standards (cycle provision to LTN1/20 guidance and 
include visibility plays) and which may be requested to be offered for 
adoption. The route and its lighting will need to be designed to demonstr ate 
that there is no impact (using measures to prevent light spill) to the adjacent 
sensitive  areas/habitats including Local Wildlife Sites and bat 
migration/feeding corridors.  
8. Enhancement of Harefield Lane to reach the Bermuda Village area to the 
east, a s well as contributions towards links to the north and east, mapped in 
the Cycle Network Development Plan.  
9. Provision of on -site bus infrastructure and contribution to secure diversion of 
frequent local bus services to access the strategic housing site, bas ed on 
dialogue with Warwickshire County Council and bus operators.

infrastructure works identified within the A444 corridor.  
11. Contribution towards increased personnel and vehicles for Warwickshi re 
Police and increase capacity at Nuneaton Justice Centre.  
12. Contribution to local sewage network improvements to increase capacity, 
improvement to the local network to reduce impact on hydraulic performance 
and improve biological treatment capacity to acc ommodate the development . 
13. Provision of allotment site extension and facilities.  
14. Provision or f inancial contributions towards sport and physical activity based 
on the requirements of the Council’s Playing Pitch and Outdoor Sports 
Strategy for pitch sport improvements, including off -site swimming pool 
provision, cycling facilities at Bedworth Physical Activity Hub, rugby pitch 
provision at Nicholas Chamberlaine School and community centre , outdoor 
tennis facilities  and athletics facility  at Pingles, N uneaton.  
15. An asset management plan for The Arbury Estate which includes measures 
to be taken and commitments to the repair and maintenance of the Park 
Farmhouse, Tea House, Bath House and Arbury Mill.  
 
Form of development  
 
16. Provision of a landscape buffer on  the southern and western edge of the site.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
67 
 17. Improvements to the urban edge through, and use of, a woodland planting 
belt in order to screen the urban edge. New woodland should be buffered on 
its eastern side by open space, which the existing houses should face.  
18. Utilise woodland planting elsewhere within the new development, with 
particular consideration given to views from Centenary Way and the existing 
residential urban edge.  
19. Broadleaved woodland should have a minimum buffer of 30m of appropriate 
habitat i n order to safeguard their integrity from imposed health and safe 
management (tree fall), garden floral escapes and garden refuse tipping.  
20. Incorporate Centenary Way and watercourses within the open space 
framework.  
21. Higher densit y housing should be concentr ated toward the current urban 
edge.  
22. Use a maximum building height of two storeys, with the aim of screening 
views of the urban edge entirely behind woodland.  
23. Development should be of a height and density which can be screened by 
the existing planting withi n and around the registered park and gardens.  
24. Any lighting should not exceed the height of the development and should be 
designed with regards to minimising light pollution.  
25. Ensor’s Pool should have a minimum buffer zone of 100m as well as any 
appropriate mitigation measures in order to ensure that the hydrological 
pathways to the pool are not compromised.  
26. All new housing and employment allocations with piled foundations or 
basements, within 1km of Ensor’s Pool Special Area of Conservation, should 
undertake  a hydrogeological study to confirm that it will not affect 
groundwater flows or quality at the Special Area of Conservation.  
27. Create a significant area of grassland habitat between Ensor’s Pool and 
Bermuda Clay Pits in order to strengthen a south -north national flow around 
the west of Nuneaton.  
28. All ponds within the development should be subject to a local wildlife site 
survey in co -ordination with great crested newts, white -clawed crayfish and 
water vole surveys. Additionally, protected speci es surveys for bats, 
hedgehog, lizards and grass snake, plus surveys for birds and important 
invertebrates as well as plants should be undertaken.  
29. Areas of high distinctiveness (values 4 to 6) should be retained.  
30. Creation of wildflower and wetland habitat and pathway to Arbury Estate 
woodland extension.  
31. Enhancements to the footpath along Harefield Lane towards Seeswood Pool.  
32. Creation of a footpath link to Ensor’s Pool from Harefield Lane.  
33. Access to any development within the strategic site should avoid approaching 
the site from the north. No access should be taken from North Drive, and 
designs should avoid introducing new approaches parallel to North Drive 
which would detract from its prominence.  
34. As part of any design proposals, suitable measures s hould be specified to 
protect Spring Kidden and North Woods ancient woodlands from any 
significant impact.  
35. Development will be required to come forward in accordance with the concept 
plan above.  
36. Development proposals must submit a comprehensive masterplan for the 
site.  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
68 
 37. Development proposals should comply with the requirements of the latest 
adopted Concept Plan SPD and Design Code SPD.  
 
 
7.40 The site will deliver approximately 1,525 new dwellings in a mix of sizes and 
tenures. The allocation is within a freehold ownership, however the land for 
the link through to Hazel Way is under a separate long leasehold agreement. 
The site is expected to be delivered through an over -arching outline 
permissi on. 
 
7.41 The allocation will be delivered on a phased basis across the plan period and 
will commence within the first 5 years after adoption.  
 
Landscape and open space  
 
7.42 Any development will be of a height and density which can be screened by the 
existing planting within and around the registered park and gardens. The 
existing trees and hedgerows will be retained in order to screen views to and 
from the strategic site, and where necessary, enhanced. The use of green 
corridors and low -rise residential development may help to mi nimise the visual 
impact of any change within the strategic site.  
 
7.43 Development will be restricted to the northern and eastern boundaries in order 
to minimise light and noise pollution, as well as to maintain an undeveloped 
landscape buffer of land bet ween the registered park and gardens and 
residential edge.  
 
7.44 New development will be designed to provide an enhanced informal 
amenity /open space adjacent to the Ensor’s Pool special area of conservation 
(Appendix J). New footway /cycleway linkage s will be provided through the site 
to the existing footway /cycleway network, including to the Bermuda Village area 
to the east, potentially via Harefield Lane.  
 
Historic environment  
 
7.45 Any development should take the opportunity to secure an asset mana gement 
plan for The Arbury Estate which includes detailed measures for the repair and 
maintenance of Park Farmhouse and the Tea House, both Grade II* listed 
buildings , included on the heritage at risk register. Consideration for the repair 
and maintenance of the Bath House and Arbury Mill should also be undertaken.  
 
7.46 Alternatively, a listed building heritage partnership agreement could be agreed 
in relation to Park  Farmhouse and the Tea House. Any heritage partnership 
agreement would not replace a requirement to prepare an asset management 
plan for The Arbury Estate, unless the heritage partnership agreement would 
do the same.  
 
7.47 Arbury Hall registered park and garden is located to the west of the strategic 
site, with the western boundary of the strategic site located between  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
69 
 approximately 60m , at its closest point , and 600m , at its furthest point , from the 
eastern boundary of the registered landscape. This park and garden form the 
focus of the Arbury Hall Estate which includes numerous listed buildings. 
Ensor’s Pool special area of conservation adjoins the eastern boundary.  
 
Transport and access  
 
7.48 A new distributor link road through the allocation will be provided to includ e 
primary access points on Heath End Road  and Walsingham Drive. New bus 
infrastructure will also be required. No access will be taken from North Drive 
and detailed site layouts will avoid introducing new approaches parallel to North 
Drive which would detra ct from its prominence.  
 
7.49 The Transport Modelling Report, commissioned by Warwickshire County 
Council , sets out a number of strategic road improvements in close proximity to 
SHA2  in order to mitigate potential cumulative impacts of all proposed strategic 
housing and employment allocations within the Borough Plan. The 
development of SHA2  is expected to contribute financially towards the A444 
corridor road improvement schemes , set out in the Transport Modelling Report, 
via planning obligation.  
 
Flooding  
 
7.50 Developers should consider reservoir flooding during the planning stage, using 
the Environment Agency’s reservoir inundation mapping . Where possible, 
developers should consider using areas at possible risk as public open space.  
 
7.51 The SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) , provided for the Borough Plan Review, 
required the site to undergo a full Level 2 assessment. The site is within Flood 
Zone s 1, 2 and 3. The Report states there is a small area at risk of fluvial 
flooding , flow paths, ponding and surface water flooding in  some flood events . 
The Report also  stated that s afe access and egress will need to be 
demonstrated in the 1% AEP plus climate change surface water and fluvial 
events  as part of any planning application . This Level 2 document should be 
considered as part o f the further site -specific flood -risk assessment  that will be 
required with any planning application . The Report concluded that both 
Sequential and Exception Tests are required for this site.  
 
 
Strategic Policy SHA3 – Land at Tuttle Hill  (Judkins 
Quarry)  
 
Introduction  
 
7.52 Strategic housing allocation SHA3 is a sustainable and deliverable housing 
allocation in the Camp Hill area of Nuneaton. The site encompasses HSG11 to 
the east of the canal which was allocated for 200 dwellings in the extant 2019 
Borough Plan. Once the Bor ough Plan Review is adopted , this previous 
allocation will be included in strategic housing allocation site SHA3. Two outline  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
70 
 applications are currently being considered one for up to 400 dwellings 
(Application reference 035595) and one for a new local cen tre, retail, hotel, 
shops, doctors surgery, public house and 18 apartments ( Application reference 
035647).  
 
 
Strategic Policy SHA3 – Land at Tuttle Hill (Judkins Quarry)  
 
Strategic housing allocation SHA3 will be developed for a mix of residential uses.  
  
Key development principles  
 
1. Provision of at least 350 dwellings in a mix of dwelling types and sizes.  
2. Financial contribution to the NHS Coventry and Warwickshire ICB. 
3. Financial contribution to off -site play and open space at Sandon Park /Stanley 
Road and to Whittleford Park, as well as appropriate management and 
maintenance arrangements and provision of on -site play area for under 12s.  
4. Financial c ontribution s would be sought in order to expand existing primary 
and secondary sch ool places.  Additionally provision for early years, SEND 
and post -16 as required.  
5. Replacement bridge or bridges across the canal will be required at the 
developer’s  expense. The applicant should have early discussions with the 
Canal and River Trust (any w orks will require the express consent of the Trust 
to ensure that the works will not affect the canal structure). Provision will need 
to be made by the developer to provide pedestrian and cycle access to the 
tow path from the site.  
 Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
71 
 6. Provision of one or more new access  points  onto Tuttle Hill, as well as 
improvements to the existing access in order to provide segregation between 
proposed and existing uses.  
7. Financial contributions towards a full specification cycle path along Stoney 
Road using the railway underbridge to link to the NCN52 and Sandon 
Park/Weddington Meadows play and open space.  
8. Financial contributions to A5 corridor cycle improvements  for the e xtension 
of the Nuneaton/Hinckley to MIRA cycle route in order to link to Mancet ter, 
Atherstone, Birch Coppice and Tamworth.  
9. Financial contributions towards Borough -wide strategic highway 
infrastructure works identified within the Nuneaton area.  
10. Financial contribution towards local bus services, including new bus 
infrastructure if req uired, based on dialogue with Warwickshire County 
Council and bus operators.  
11. Provision/f inancial contributions towards sport and physical activity  including 
play areas, MUGA and playing pitches . 
12. Financial contributions will be required to upgrade the towpa th surface in the 
area.  
13. Contribution towards increased personnel and vehicles for Warwickshire 
Police.  
14. Contribution towards increased capacity at Nuneaton Justice Centre.  
 
Form of development  
 
15. Retain and enhance the wooded character of Coventry Canal, including new 
planting close to the industrial areas through taller hedgerows and linear 
woodland. New woodland should be linear and along field margins, reducing 
the prominence of the development from the wider landscape to the north.  
16. Retain views towards the man -made mound (Mount Judd) as a feature and 
landmark within the landscape.  
17. Development should use the canal as the key reference and focal point to the 
design and should take the opportunity to improve the setting of the canal, 
which should in clude better public access and interpretation.  
18. Retention and enhancement of green infrastructure along the canal and 
disused railway corridors so that they remain as wildlife corridors.  
19. Protected species surveys will be required at the site.  
20. Retention and enhancement of areas of biodiversity value where possible, 
with appropriate biodiversity offsetting provision where necessary.  
21. Enhance accessibility and the structural condition of heritage assets along 
Coventry Canal including retention of t he heritage buildings including the 
locally listed beehive kiln37.  
22. New housing should address the canal. A detailed light contour map , of 
proposed lighting , will be required to ensure no light spill to the canal wildlife 
corridor , alongside a construction  management plan to reduce the effects of 
the development on the Coventry Canal. This should include sufficient

and Ident ification.  
   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
72 
 evidence that the stability of the canal infrastructure , including the cutting , will 
not be affected during or after construction.  
23. Enhancements  to canal towpath.  
24. Building heights nearest the canal should be limited to 2 storeys in order to 
limit their visual impact above and through the canal -side woodland corridor.  
 
 
7.53 Strategic housing allocation SHA3 is allocated for at least 350 dwellings and is 
subject to an outline application (035595) which is yet to be determined.  The 
site comprises previously disturbed former mining land associated with the 
adjacent Judkins Quar ry. Both land parcels are considered deliverable. The 
land to the west of the canal includes part of the designated Judkins Quarry 
local wildlife site, which supports a number of valuable habitats and species 
including great crested newts. This will be a c onstraint for site delivery, with the 
proposal required to demonstrate that impacts have been avoided, mitigated or 
compensated as a last resort under Policy NE3. The land to the east of the 
canal is of less ecological value.  
 
7.54 The site is approximatel y 350m away from Abbey Green district centre. The 
district centre has facilities to meet day -to-day local needs including retail 
shops, a public house, health facilities, cafes, hairdressers and hot food 
takeaways. Nuneaton Town Centre is approximately 800 m to the south -east of 
the site, which offers a wider range of retail, commercial and recreational uses.  
 
7.55 The site is understood to be in two ownerships, but the landowners see the 
value in working together to bring the site forward in a comprehensive and 
integrated manner. It is essential that landowners come to a voluntary 
agreement based on sharing the cost of off -site and on -site infrastructure 
requirements.  
 
7.56 The allocation will be delivered on a phased basis across the plan perio d and 
will commence within the first 5 years after adoption.  
 
Transport and access  
 
7.57 The principal access to the site will be via the existing quarry entrance onto 
Tuttle Hill located to the west of the canal. Following discussions with the 
highway’s a uthority, a secondary access onto Tuttle Hill will also be required to 
provide segregation between proposed and existing  uses , to accommodate the 
level of traffic that will be generated from the proposed dwellings and to provide 
a safe pedestrian route away from the HGVs associated with the existing uses . 
Access to the land to the east of the canal will be via the existing quarry land 
only and will require the construction of a new link bridge over the canal. The 
opportunity for this bridge to form  a green link across the site , and linking to 
existing public right s of way , should be considered.  
 
7.58 Previous transport modelling , commissioned by Warwickshire County Council , 
sets out a number of strategic road improvements in close proximity to SHA3  in 
order to mitigate potential cumulative impacts of all proposed strategic housing 
and employment allocations within the Borough Plan. The development of 
SHA3 is expected to contribute financially towards the Nuneaton area road  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
73 
 improvement schemes, set o ut in the Transport Modelling Report, alongside 
contributing to any other improvements that will be required, via planning 
obligations.  
 
Canal improvements  
 
7.59 The development of the site will take the opportunity to improve the setting of 
the canal, including better public access and interpretation. The canal offers the 
opportunity to become part of green infrastructure for the strategic site and a 
sustainable transport route with an existing towpath, which should be upgraded 
to encourage acces s. 
 
Flooding  
 
7.60 Developers should be aware that any site that is at or below canal bank level 
may be subject to canal flooding, and this should be considered when building 
resilience into low level properties. Due to the potentially numerous locations 
for failure scenarios, a detailed site -specific investigation will be needed to 
determine possible flood risk implications to the site.  
 
7.61 The SFRA Level 2 (August 2023) provided for the Borough Plan Review, 
required the site to undergo a full Level 2 assessment. The site is within Flood 
Zone 1 , but the report flags the site as having some ground and surface water 
risk and ponding. Development proposals at the site must address the potential 
changes associated with climate change and be des igned to be safe for the 
intended lifetime. The provisions for safe access and egress must also address 
the potential increase in severity and frequency of flooding. The document 
should be referred to and be considered as part of the further site -specific flood -
risk assessment that will be required for the site with any planning application.  
The Report concluded that both Sequential and Exception Tests are required 
for this site.  
 
Future Development Potential  
 
7.62 There is potential for land at the wider Judkins Quarry (adjacent the allocated 
site) to come forward for development within the plan period. The site presents 
a unique opportunity for the re -development of a major brownfield site , within 
the Borough , to deliver a mix of uses including hous ing and employment land 
to meet the longer term needs of the Borough beyond the plan period . Given 
the historic use of the site , there is a significant amount of remediation and 
mitigation required , before the site could come forward for development. 
There fore, whilst the land is not allocated within the plan for development, the 
Borough Council are supportive of initiatives which would help redevelop the 
site in the longer term. Investment opportunities are being investigated with 
Partner organisations to open up this land for development.

19. Ensure new high  quality houses face onto the northern side of Hospital Lane  
in order to form an attractive urban edge to southwest Bedworth.  
20. A buffer of fields should be preserved so as to retain the isolated character 
of Moat Farm on Hospital Lane.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
76 
 21. Retain and improve the hedgerows along the field edges and consider 
creating wild life buffer strips along footpaths to improve connectivity.  
22. The layout of the development should be designed to reflect the irregular field 
patterns and boundaries.  
23. Provision of landscaping to the northern side of Hospital Lane in order to 
soften and limit views of the new urban edge.  
24. Improve areas along the edge of the current built up area and proposed 
development site to maintain footpaths, scrubland and grassland areas to 
open countryside beyond Hospital Lane.  
25. Retain public rights of way and comple ment with new pedestrian routes and 
links.  Hospital Field local wildlife site (rejected) should be considered as a 
biodiversity offsetting site for restoration as a community woodland or local 
nature reserve.  
26. Incorporate a wildlife area for Newdigate Prima ry School at the southern end 
of the playing field which runs alongside a public footpath.  
 
 
7.64 The site covers 22.4ha and is defined to the west by Hospital Lane and 
residential properties to the south, east and north. Newdigate Primary School 
and Anderton Road Playing Fields are also located to the north of the site.  
 
7.65 The site will deliver approximately 445 new dwellings in a mix of sizes and 
tenures. The site is in a single ownership and is being delivered through an 
overarching outline permission.  
 
7.66 The allocation will be delivered on a phased basis across the pl an period and 
commence within the first 5 years after adoption.  
 
District centre  
 
7.67 The nearest local centre in Goodyers End is on Smorrall Lane, approximately 
950m , at the closest point, to the site. A new district centre will be developed in 
the north -eastern corner of the site to serve existing and future residents of 
Goodyers End and reduce the need to travel.  
 
School provision  
 
7.68 Land adjacent to the existing Newdigate Primary School boundary will be 
retained to accommodate expansion of the primary school premises , if 
demonstrated necessary through discussions with Warwickshire County 
Council .  
 
7.69 At secondary level, financial contributions are anticipated i n order to expand 
existing secondary provision up to an additional 3.5 form entry. The contribution 
would be part of a pool of contributions from other strategic and non -strategic 
housing allocations, where pupils are expected to attend local secondary 
schools in the Bedworth /Ash Green area.  
 
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
77 
 Footpaths and cycle routes  
 
7.70 Two north -south footpaths and an east -west footpath run across the site, linking 
in with nearby residential streets. The existing footpaths will be retained and 
integrated into the site via the provision of a footway /cycleway network through 
the site, linking Hospital Lane and Goodyers End Lane with Mavor Drive, 
Anderton Road and the existing /expanded recreation ground. There will also 
need to be a contribution towards a cycle path l ink towards Bedworth Town 
Centre and to schools in the vicinity.  
 
Transport and access  
 
7.71 Primary access for vehicles will be provided from Hospital Lane, with additional 
secondary vehicular access possible from Mavor Drive, Maynard Avenue and 
Jeffrey Close. Contributions towards associated improvements to Hospital 
Lane, Smorrall Lane, Goodyers  End Lane and bus infrastructure will be sought.   
 
7.72 The Transport Modelling Report, commissioned by Warwickshire County 
Council , sets out a number of strategic road improvements in close proximity to 
SHA4 in order to mitigate potential cumulative impacts of all proposed strategic 
housing and employment allocations within the Borough Plan. The 
development of SHA4 is expected to contribut e financially towards road 
improvement schemes in the Bedworth area , as set out in the Transport 
Modelling Report , via planning obligation.  
 
Flood risk  
 
7.73 The SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) provided for the Borough Plan Review, flags 
the site as at risk of low flood risk , but ponding and flows outside the site  during 
flood surface water event s are likely to limit access/egress to the site . 
Consideration must  be made to the nature of the risk and  how safe access and 
egress can be provided during flood events  (including an allowance for climate 
change) , both to people and emergency vehicles  with the further site -specific 
flood -risk assessment  that will be required for the site with any planning 
application.  The Level 2 Assessment should be referred to and be considered 
with any submission.  
  
Strategic Policy SHA5 – West of Bulkington  
 
Introduction  
 
7.74 Strategic housing allocation SHA5 is a sustainable and deliverable extension 
on the western edge of Bulkington.  The site was allocated as HSG8 in the 
adopted plan with a further parcel to the north for 495 dwellings (this parcel is 
now under construction ).  
 
7.75 The allocation now benefits from either full /outline  permission or full /outline

79 
 places.  Additional provision for early years, secondary  (to an additional 3.5 
form entry ), SEND and post -16 as required.  
6. Bus infrastructure improvements within or adjacent to SHA5, with a potential 
contribution to secure diversion of frequent local bus services to access the 
strategic housing site based on dialogue with Warwickshire County Council 
and bus operators.  
7. Any transpor t improvements /upgrades required for a right turn bay on the 
B4112 Nuneaton Road southbound approach to the B4112 Nuneaton 
Road/Weston Lane junction and along Bedworth Road, Coventry Road and 
surrounding streets as a result of the development.  
8. Financial co ntributions towards highways infrastructure identified in the 
Strategic Transport Assessment for Bulkington.  
9. Provision of a footway /cycleway network through the open space on the site,

11. Financial contributions towards the development of a dedicated cycle path 
along the B4029 between Bulkington and Bedworth.  
12. Potential local sewage netw ork improvements to improve capacity to 
accommodate the development, subject to discussions with Severn Trent 
Water.  
13. Financial contributions towards sport and physical activity based on the 
requirements of the Council’s Playing Pitch and Outdoor Sports Str ategy 
(2023) for pitch sport improvements, including off -site swimming pool 
provision, cycling facilities at Bedworth Physical Activity Hub, Pingles 
athletics facility, rugby pitch provision at Nicholas Chamberlaine School and

15. Financial contribution for primary medical care to be given to the NHS 
Coventry and Warwickshire ICB. 
16. Contribution towards increased personnel and vehicles for Warwickshire 
Police  and capacity at Bedworth Police Station.   
 
Form of development  
 
17. Landscape buffer along Bedworth Road to enhance the character and 
approach into the village from the west.  
18. Development along Bedworth Road should mirror the existing landscape 
treatment and scale of development and should be designed so as to frame 
views towards the church and refrain from dense planting which may limit 
views towards the church.  
19. Creation of substantial hedgerow s with hedgerow trees along  the western 
and southern boundary (to be maintained as a Green Belt defensible 
boundary).  
20. The hedgerows provide ecological links from Bulkington Recreational Ground 
and the railway line , and thereafter into the countryside. These features 
should be safeguarded and strengthened.  
21. Enhancement of linear woodland along the railway line.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
80 
 22. Conserve and enhance the pattern of small and medium sized fields b ounded 
by intact hedgerows where possible.  
23. Retain and enhance field ponds through incorporat ing them  into a network of 
interconnected open spaces and undertake related protected species 
surveys including for great crested newts.  
24. Creation of a green corrido r along public right of way (B41) as part of an 
interconnected network of open spaces.  
25. All site boundaries should be enhanced through new planting of trees whilst 
maintaining adequate distances from housing , and all veteran hedgerows 
should be retained and surveyed prior to development. Species rich 
hedgerows should be incorporated within areas of open space.  
26. Development proposals should be in accordance with the extant HSG8 
Concept Plan SPD and ensure access  arrangements , including widths of 
access points and spine roads , are sufficient to ensure the delivery of all of 
the sites. Any links must also be contiguous to the adjacent development 
parcel, as far as reasonably practicable.  
 
 
7.76 The site covers 18.2ha and is effectively split into two parcels.  The site will 
deliver approximately 348 new dwellings in a mix of sizes and tenures.  
 
7.77 The allocation will be delivered on a phased basis across the plan period and 
commence within the first 5 y ears after adoption.  
 
Open spaces  
 
7.78 Formal and informal public open space will be concentrated along the western 
edge of SHA5. These spaces would contain new combined pedestrian and 
cycle routes in order to create green routes for pedestrians, cyclists and wildlife. 
Play provision will need to be delivered in accordance with the Open Space and 
Green Infrastructure SPD.  
 
Footpaths and cycle routes  
 
7.79 Linkages between the northern and southern parcels should be explored to 
ensure a comprehensive and integrated redevelopment of the strategic  housing 
site, and to provide permeability through the development, however, this 
involves third party land not included in the allocation.  
 
7.80 In order to improve connectivity, a 3m wide combined footpath and cycleway 
will be provided from within the ar eas of open space, in order to create new car -
free green routes through the site. The routes will link Coventry Road with 
Bedworth Road. A new toucan crossing on Bedworth Road will allow 
pedestrians and cyclists to cross Bedworth Road between the northern and 
central parcels of SHA5.  
 
7.81 SHA5 is expected to contribute financially towards the development of a 
dedicated cycle path along the B4029 Bedworth Road between Bulkington and 
Bedworth. This will encourage new residents to access Bulkington District  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
81 
 Centre, Bedworth Town Centre and Nicholas Chamberlaine School via 
alternative car -free modes of transportation.  
 
7.82 Off-site works include upgrading the existing sports facilities and  teenage play 
provision at Bulkington Recreation Ground and  the improvement of facilities at 
Miners Welfare Park in Bedworth.  
 
School provision  
 
7.83 Educational contributions will be sought to ensure that the expansion and 
reorganisation of both Arden Forest Infant and St James Academy Junior 
schools are appropriate in order to meet demand.  At secondary level, financial 
contributions are anticipated in order to expand existing secondary provision up 
to an additional 3.5 form entry. The contribution would be part of a pool from 
other strategic and non -strategic allocations in the Bedworth and Bulkington 
area, where pupils are expected to attend local secondary schools in the 
Bedworth /Ash Green area.  
 
Transport and access  
 
7.84 Primary access for vehicles will be provided from Bedworth Road for the 
northern parcel of the site. The southern parcel of SHA5 has two potential 
access points from Coventry Road. Additional secondary vehicular accesses 
are possible from Leyland Road (southern parcel). Contributions towards 
highway improvements and bus infrastructure will be sought.   
 
7.85 The Transport Modelling Report , commissioned by Warwickshire County 
Council , set out a number of strategic road improvements in close proximity to 
SHA5 in order to mitigate potential cumulative impacts of all proposed strategic 
housing and employment allocations within the Borough Plan. The 
development of SHA5 is expected to contribute financially towards road 
improvement schemes in the Bedworth area , as set out in the Transport 
Modelling Report, via planning obligation s. 
 
Flooding  
 
7.86 The SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) , provided for the Borough Plan Review , 
required the site to undergo a full Level 2 assessment. The site is within Flood 
Zone 1. The Report states there is likely to be some surface water and flows 
during flood events. Safe access and egress will need to be demonstrated in 
the 1% AEP plus 40% cl imate change surface water event. Site drainage 
proposals should address the requirements for access routes, avoid impeding 
surface water flows and preserve the storage of surface water to avoid 
exacerbation of flood risk in the wider catchment. The docume nt should be 
referred to and be considered as part of the further site -specific flood -risk 
assessment that will be required for the site with any planning application.  The 
Report concluded that both Sequential and Exception Tests are required for 
this site .

 Strategic Policy SHA6 – Land at former Hawkesbury 
Golf Course  
 
Introduction  
 
7.87 Strategic housing allocation SHA6 is a sustainable and deliverable urban 
extension to Bedworth.  The site was allocated in the adopted Borough Plan as 
HSG12 for 380 dwellings. The Allocation now benefits from one full and one

 relevant junctions within the wider B4113 Longford Road corridor. This will 
require dialogue with Warwickshire County Council and Coventry City Council , 
as the r elevant authorities responsible for the corridor.  
 
Flooding  
 
7.95 The SFRA Level 2 (August 2023), provided for the Borough Plan Review, 
required the site to undergo a full Level 2 assessment. The site is within Flood 
Zone 1. The report flags the site as ha ving some surface water flood risk. Site 
drainage proposals should address the requirements for access routes, avoid 
impeding surface water flows and preserve the storage of surface water to 
avoid exacerbation of flood risk in the wider catchment. Developm ent proposals 
at the site must address the potential changes associated with climate change 
and be designed to be safe for the intended lifetime. The provisions for safe 
access and egress must also address the potential increase in severity and 
frequency o f flooding. The document should be referred to and be considered 
as part of the further site -specific flood -risk assessment that will be required for 
the site with any planning application. The Report concluded that both 
Sequential and Exception Tests are required for this site.

Borough area to the south -east of the M6 and A444 junction. An overhead 
power line runs in a west -east direction across the northern part of the site.  
 
7.99 The site is bounded by residential development to the east and industrial uses 
to the south -east. The land to the south known as Sowe Meadows is  owned by 
Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council and managed as a designated local 
wildlife site.  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
89 
 7.100  The site is 23ha and will deliver a local growth point including approximately 73 
dwellings and 1 9.09ha of employment uses over the plan period, with i ntegrated 
landscaping, open space and drainage mitigation. The final net figure will be 
determined by the design and layout of the site.  
 
7.101 Residential development will be focussed in the north -eastern and south -
eastern parts of the site, adjacent to the existing residential areas. The 
remainder of the site will be brought forward for employment uses.  
 
7.102 Ancillary offices E(g) should be focused on the eastern part of the site, adjacent 
to the existing and proposed residential properties. B2 and B8 uses will be 
focussed on the western part of the site. Scheme layouts need to take into 
consideration potential stand -offs and easements associated with the overhead 
power line, and early discussions with National Grid are essential i n informing 
any detailed layout, but it is considered that parking and storage areas will be 
provided in the vicinity of the power line.  
 
Transport and access  
 
7.103 It has been agreed with the highways authority that separate access points will 
be created  for the proposed employment and residential uses on the site. All 
HGV parking and servicing areas , associated with the employment uses on the 
site, will be accessed via a new entrance onto the B4113. The final junction 
solution will be agreed following th e completion of a transport assessment.  
 
7.104 Access to the residential areas will be via two new access points onto Wilsons 
Lane. The existing pedestrian access to public footpaths B23 and B25 will be 
retained. Contributions towards associated improvements to Wilsons Lane, the 
B4113 and bus infrastru cture will be sought.   
 
7.105 The Transport Modelling Report , commissioned by Warwickshire County 
Council , sets out a number of strategic road improvements in close proximity to 
the site in order to mitigate potential cumulative impacts of all proposed 
strategic housing and employment allocations within the Borough Plan. The 
development of the site is expected to contribute financially towards road 
improvement schemes in the Bedworth area , as set out in the Transport 
Modelling Report, via planni ng obligation.  
 
Flooding  
 
7.106 The SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) , provided for the Borough Plan Review,  
required the site to undergo  a full Level 2 assessment . The majority of the area 
is in Flood Zone 1 but adjacent to the river the site is within Flood Zone 2 and 
Flood Zone 3. The Report states that fluvial, surface flood risk and ponding 
across the site is considered to be low, but increasing in flood events and an 
appropriate assessment of the groundwater regime should be carried out at  the 
site-specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) stage.  Development proposals at 
the site must address the potential changes associated with climate change 
and be designed to be safe for the intended lifetime. The report also states that 
safe access and egre ss must be demonstrated especially with the likely  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
90 
 increase in severity and frequency of flooding . Development must avoid 
impeding surface water flows and preserve the storage of surface water to avoid 
exacerbation of flood risk in the wider catchment. The document should be 
referred to and be considered as part of the further site -specific flood -risk 
assessment that will be required for the site with any planning application. The 
Report concluded that Sequential and Exception Tests  are required for this si te. 
 
Strategic Policy SEA3 – Prologis extension  
 
Introduction  
 
7.107 Strategic employment site SEA3 comprises of an extension to an existing 
employment park and will contribute to meeting the strategic employment 
needs of the Borough and job creation objectives of the Borough Plan.  The site 
received outline consent  for employment use  (Application reference 038023 - 
July 2022 ). Two reserved matters schemes are being considered in tandem, 
one large single unit (Application reference 039750) and another two smaller 
units (Application reference 039751) with potential for additional mezzanine 
space.  
 
 
 
Strategic Policy SEA3: Prologis Extension  
 
Strategic employment site SEA3 will be developed for employment, comprising use 
classes  E(g) (ii and iii), B2 and B8 uses.  
 
 Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
91 
 Key development principles  
 
1. Provision of approximately 3.58ha of employment land.  
2. Crushed stone public footway from Pilgrims Walk to New Road /country park, 
running along the eastern side of the site.  
 
Form of development  
 
3. Retention /enhancement of landscape screening to the northern and southern 
boundaries (plantation woodland) and easte rn boundary (hedgerow).  
4. Provision of new landscape screening on the western boundary and 
enhancements to existing structural planting on the site.  
5. Habitat creation, enhancement and subsequent sympathetic management, 
along the northern, western and southern boundaries to maintain and 
increase suitable breeding and terrestrial habitats for great crested newts, 
and to provide sustainable habitat connectivity with Prologis Country Park 
(local wildlife site) to the east/south -east:  
a. Retention of existing waterbody (southern boundary) and creation of new 
waterbodies.  
b. New hibernacula.  
c. Management of retained grassland; and  
d. Access roads to have appropriate connective measures for amphibians 
to allow their safe passage along the southern boundary.  
6. Retention of existing surfaced path to the New Road.  
7. Crushed stone public footway from Pilgrims Walk (at south -west corner of 
site) to existing surfaced path linking to New Road and the Prologis Country 
Park (at north -east corner of site).  
8. Vehicular access to be provid ed from Pilgrims Walk.  
9. Building height to be restricted to 15m to ridge closest to the western

boundary borders Pilgrims Walk, which also serve s Plot H. It mainly comprises 
poor semi -improved grassland, together with plantation woodland along the 
northern and southern boundaries, inc luding a pond to the south.  
 
7.109 The site will deliver approximately  3.58ha  for employment uses, including 
access, parking, servicing and landscaping /habitat enhancement. The final net 
figure will be determined by the design and layout of the site. The final scheme 
layout will need to provide a wayleave for the overhead power lines.

92 
 Biodiversity  
 
7.110 Land to the east /south -east of the site is subject to a non -statutory local wildlife 
site designation (Prologis Country Park local wildlife site). A key feature of the 
local wildlife site is the meta -population of great crested newts (a European 
protected species) that it supports, which the on -going management of the 
country park has specific objectives for.  
 
7.111 The SEA3 site itself includes a small pond which supports breeding great 
crested newts, and to ensure that the favourable conservation status of the local 
great crested newt population is maintained, the site will require on -site 
mitigation and additional off -site mitigation i n the adjacent country park.  
 
7.112 Beyond the mitigation measures for great crested newts, development of SEA3 
will result in an overall loss of habitat, but much of this will be poor semi -
improved grassland of low biodiversity distinctiveness. However, t o ensure that 
there is no net loss of biodiversity, the proposed development will be subject to 
a Warwickshire Biodiversity Impact Assessment to identify the level of 
compensatory habitat creation /enhancement that will be required , either within 
the Prolog is Country Park or at another appropriate off -site location.  
 
Transport and access  
 
7.113 Access to the site will be via the existing road infrastructure within Prologis Park 
(Winding House Lane /Central Boulevard) with access points taken from 
Pilgrims Walk. Existing footpath routes will be retained. There is potential for 
separate access points for HGVs and cars . However , this needs to take existing 
landscape and ecological constraints into account.  
 
7.114 The Transport Modelling Report , commi ssioned by Warwickshire County 
Council , sets out a number of strategic road improvements in close proximity to 
SEA3 to mitigate potential cumulative impacts of all proposed strategic housing 
and employment allocations within the Borough Plan. The developme nt of 
SEA3 is expected to contribute financially towards the A444 corridor road and 
Bedworth area improvement schemes, set out in the Transport Modelling 
Report, via planning obligation.  
 
 
Strategic Policy SEA4 – Coventry Road  
 
Introduction  
 
7.115 Strategic employment site SEA4 will contribute to meeting the strategic 
employment needs of the Borough, as well as the job creation objectives of the 
Borough Plan. The site is located on the south -eastern edge of the Hill Top area 
of Nuneaton and comprise s derelict land formally in use as the Griff granite 
quarry.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
93 
  
 
Strategic Policy SEA4: Coventry Road  
 
Strategic employment site SEA4 will be developed for employment uses comprising 
use classes E(g)  (ii and iii), B2 and B8.  
  
Key development principles  
 
1. Provision of approximately 9 .59ha of employment land.  
2. Upgrade of existing access onto Coventry Road (B4113).  
3. Financial contributions towards Borough -wide strategic highway 
infrastructure works identified within the A444 corridor.  
4. Financial cont ributions to deliver bus /rail interchange facilities on St Georges 
Way in the vicinity of Bermuda Park Rail Station - including real time 
passenger information to support improved bus access to the  Bermuda 
residential area and employment sites.  
5. Financial contribution towards the delivery of biodiversity enhancement s on 
land to the south of Centenary Way (Griff Hollows local wildlife site), as well 
as biodiversity offsetting.  
6. Financial contribution towards the reopening of the culverted Griff Broo k. 
7. Financial contribution towards delivery of an area wide green infrastructure 
SPD (or equivalent) that promotes species movement along identified green 
corridors.  
8. Suitable sewage connection to the existing foul drainage network  and 
contributions  to local sewage network , improvements to increase capacity, 
improvement to the local network to reduce impact on hydraulic performance 
and improve biological treatment capacity to accommodate the development.  
 Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
94 
 9. Creation of cycle path link betwe en Bermuda Station and Coventry Road, as 
well as contribution s to a crossing point for Coventry Road  and contributions 
to the  Bermuda Connectivity Project . 
10. Reinforce connectivity through the creation of footpath and cycle connections 
through the site from Coventry Road B4113 to the Griff Brook to the north 
and the canal towpath to the east.  
 
Form of development  
 
11. Provision of landscape screening along the northern, eastern, western and 
southern boundaries.  
12. Broadleaved woodland should be retained and res tored where possible.  
13. Smaller scale (and height) development (similar scale to the adjacent 
Bermuda Industrial Estate) will be located nearer to the residential edge to 
the north and east.  
14. Shorter side or gable end of building form to front onto Centenary Way in 
order to reduce perceived effects of scale and massing of any proposed 
development on any retained public open space.  
15. Use of colour graduation on elevations from darker colours to base, and 
lighter colours nearer to rooflines in order to better inte grate development into 
the landscape.  
16. Maintain an open corridor to the south of the site accommodating Centenary 
Way, with appropriate tree and shrub planting in order to limit effects to views 
along this public right of way.  
17. Opportunities to improve the h eritage features of the area and their link to the 
work of George Eliot should be pursued where possible. The Canal and River 
Trust requires that opportunities are given to restore part of the industrial 
heritage of the locality and re -establish the canal branch through the site, 
linking it to the remaining portion to the east.  
18. Areas of high distinctiveness should look to be preserved to form part of a 
network of natural habitats. Habitat connectivity to the south should be 
maintained and enhanced to allow connections to the wider local wildlife site, 
including along the southern boundary of the site . 
 
 
7.116 Land directly to the south of SEA4 was part of the Griff granite quarry and was 
extensively quarried throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries. The site is now restored and designated as the Griff Hollows local 
wildlife site. The Centenary Way long distance footpath crosses the south of the 
site. Griff Brook runs, in culvert, parallel with Centenary Way.  
 
7.117 The site will d eliver approximately 9 ha gross (8.6ha net) for employment uses, 
including parking and servicing areas. The site is in two ownerships, but all 
landowners see the value in working together to bring the site forward in a 
comprehensive and integrated manner. I t is essential that landowners come to 
a voluntary agreement based on sharing the cost of off -site and on -site 
infrastructure requirements. The final net figure will be determined by the design 
and layout of the site.  
 
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
95 
 Local wildlife site and biodiversity  
 
7.118 Land to the south of the developable area of SEA4 forms part of the Griff 
Hollows local wildlife site. The site is being brought forward for development in 
combination with on and off -site ecological mitigation as well as wider 
biodiversity enhancement. Th is will result in the enhancement of the habitat 
connectivity of the Griff Hollows local wildlife site and will create wider linkages 
to Bermuda Balancing Lake local wildlife site and Coventry Canal. A key 
element of this will be the reopening of the culve rt to enable mammals to 
connect along ecological corridors. The Griff Hollows local wildlife site should 
be re -surveyed and this should include the water vole survey project being 
undertaken by Warwickshire Wildlife Trust.  
 
Transport  
 
7.119 The Transport Modelling Report, commissioned by Warwickshire County 
Council , sets out a number of strategic road improvements in close proximity to 
SEA4 in order to mitigate potential cumulative impacts of all proposed strategic 
housing and employment allocations within  the Borough Plan. The 
development of SEA4 is expected to contribute financially towards the A444 
corridor road improvement schemes , set out in the  Transport Modelling Report , 
via planning obligation.  
 
Historic environment  
 
7.120 SEA4 and its surrounding area is associated with the works of the writer George 
Eliot. Development of SEA4 provides an opportunity to improve this association 
and establish connections of the Griff Hollow area to the former section of the 
canal branch. This could be ac hieved via the following:  
 
• Re-establishing the canal branch through the site and linking to the 
remaining portion to the east, in order to restore part of the industrial heritage 
of the locality as well as creating a continuous wildlife corridor habitat.  
• Selection of appropriate planting as demonstrated in historic photos and 
George Eliot’s description of Red Deep in The Mill on the Floss.  
• Connecting the site to the wider landscape through the use of a 
heritage /literary trail.  
• Establishing a walking route b etween the proposed George Eliot Visitor 
Centre at Griff Hotel and Griff Hollow . 
 
Flooding  
 
7.121 The SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) provided for the Borough Plan Review, 
required the site to undergo  a full Level 2 assessment. The site is within Flood 
Zone s 1, 2 and 3. Modelling used for the Level 2 states that the site is at very 
low risk of fluvial and surface water flooding,  but which increases with flood 
events.  Access and egress to the site is l imited due to the surrounding 
environment, access off Coventry Road shows there is some flood 
exceedances in the area. Therefore, s afe access and egress will need to be  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan

 demonstrated in flood events plus climate change , fluvial and surface water 
events. Sit e drainage proposals should address the requirements for access 
routes, avoid impeding surface water flows and preserve the storage of surface 
water to avoid exacerbation of flood risk in the wider catchment.  The document 
should be considered as part of th e further site -specific flood -risk assessment 
that will be required for any planning application . The Report concluded that a 
Sequential Test  is required for this site.

Strategic Policy SEA6 – Bowling Green Lane  
 
Introduction  
 
7.123 Strategic employment allocation SEA6 will contribute to meeting the strategic 
employment needs of the Borough, as well as the job creation objectives of the 
plan, delivering some residential dwellings to contribute towards the Borough ’s 
needs.  Two outline application s for the site’s development ha ve been submitted 
for the demolition of all existing structures and for the development of 
commercial /industrial floorspace and ancillary office space  (Application

Strategic Policy SEA6: Bowling Green Lane  
 
Strategic employment site SEA6 will be developed for employment uses comprising 
use classes E(g) (ii and iii), B2 and B8 and residential uses.   
  
Key development principles  
 
1. Provision of approximately 19 .89ha of employment land.  
2. Provision of approximately 7ha of land to deliver at least 150 dwellings.  
3. Provision of a new junction onto Bowli ng Green Lane at the School Lane 
junction, with associated traffic lights and any transport improvements /new 
junctions and upgrades required along Bowling Green Lane and School Lane 
(in conjunction with both the development on School Lane and either by 
agreement with the landowner or securing the transfer of the land to the 
highway authority to facilitate the use of highway powers for land outside of 
the School Lane site. The developer will be expected to submit for agreement 
an HGV routing strategy which w ill show HGVs accessing /egressing the site 
from the School Lane direction and avoiding the local schools on Bowling 
Green Lane, Ash Green Lane and Wheelwright Lane).  
4. Financial contributions towards Borough -wide strategic highway 
infrastructure works , identified within the Bedworth area , and provision of a 
cycle network within the site, including contributions to links beyond the site 
to residential areas and toward Bedworth Town Centre.  
5. Developer contribution towards local bus service(s) to serve the employment 
site in order to enhance accessibility for local residents.  
 Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
98 
 6. Developer delivery, or contribution, as agreed within Warwickshire County 
Council, to  secure provision of bus infrastructure to complement the point 
above.  
7. Suitable sewage connection to  the existing foul drainage network  and 
contributions t o increase capacity to the treatment works to support growth . 
8. Contribution towards increased personnel and vehicles for Warwickshire 
Police.  
 
Form of development  
 
9. Provision of landscape buffer along n orthern boundary (minimum width of 
15m) and western boundary.  
10. Ecological enhancements to existing boundary on southern and eastern 
edges of the site.  
11. Provision of enhanced buffer in the south -eastern corner to protect the setting 
of the Exhall Hall scheduled monument and listed buildings, as well as 
ensuring that the scale of development does not detract from the prominence 
and importance of the listed buildings.  
12. Retain existing hedgerows and trees as part of the green infrastructure for 
any developm ent. Enhance existing hedgerows with new planting where they 
have become fragmented.  Retention of the public right of way within a 
landscape enhancement area either side of the route in order to form a 
strategic landscaping area through the centre of the site.  
13. Protected species assessment of areas of tall ruderal around field gate.  
14. Habitat adjoining the motorway should be retained as an important wildlife 
corridor.  
15. Provision of landscape screening consisting of small groups of specimen 
trees interspers ed amongst grassed areas and wildflower meadows.  
16. New development should be accompanied by woodland and tree planting to 
reduce its prominence within the landscape. Opportunities should be taken 
to enhance the urban edge through planting new trees and woodl and. 
17. Scale and massing of building form around northern edge of site should be 
reduced due to proximity to residential properties.  
18. Orientate employment buildings to limit visual effects.  
19. Explore opportunities to retain views towards Bedworth Water Tower.  
 
 
7.124 The site is located on the south -western edge of Goodyers End. The allocation 
is triangular in shape and defined by Bowling Green Lane to the east, Goodyers 
End Lane to the north and the M6 to the south. The land slopes gradually from 
north to south. A public right of way links Bowling Green Lane with Goodyers 
End Lane, following the site’s southern boundary before crossing the site in a 
north -westerly direction. A 400k V overhead line crosses the north -eastern part 
of the site in a north -west to south -east direction.  
 
7.125 The site comprises 26ha of open land and will deliver 19 .89ha for employment 
uses, including parking and servicing areas, and approximately 7ha for the 
residential uses.  
 
7.126 The allocation will be delivered wit hin the first 5 years after adoption.  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
99 
 Transport and access  
 
7.127 Primary access for vehicles to the employment parts of the site will be provided 
from a new signalised junction on Bowling Green Lane, together with any 
upgrades required along Bowling Gree n Lane and School Lane (in conjunction 
with the new residential development on School Lane). Should a secondary 
access be required to serve the areas reserved for employment uses, this 
should be served from Goodyers End Lane, and should be limited to provi de 
access for emergency vehicles, car parking, and cycle and pedestrian linkages. 
All HGV parking and delivery areas are to be served from the primary access 
point leading from Bowling Green Lane. The residential parts of the allocation 
should be served by  its own access(es) from Bowling Green Lane.  
 
7.128 The Transport Modelling Report , commissioned by Warwickshire County 
Council , sets out a number of strategic road improvements in close proximity to 
the site in order to mitigate potential cumulative impacts of all proposed 
strategic housing and employment allocations within the Borough Plan. The 
development of the allocation is expecte d to contribute financially towards the 
corridor road improvement schemes in the Bedworth area , as set out in the 
Transport Modelling Report, via planning obligation.  
 
Flooding  
 
7.129 The SFRA  Level 2 ( August  2023) , provided for the Borough Plan Review , 
required the site to undergo a full Level 2 assessment. The site is within Flood 
Zone 1 . The Report states there is no fluvial risk and surface water flood risk , 
to most of the site , is shown as very low but modelling shows that ponding and 
ground water risk is increased in flood events. A culvert in the area could pose 
a threat if blocked. The Report suggests an appropriate assessment of the 
groundwater regime should be carried out a t the site -specific Flood Risk 
Assessment (FRA) stage.  The Report states that d evelopment proposals at the 
site must address the potential changes associated with climate change and be 
designed to be safe for the intended lifetime. The provisions for safe access 
and egress must also address the potential increase in severity and frequency 
of flooding in the 1% AEP plus 40% climate change surface water event. Site 
drainage proposals should address the requirements for access routes, avoid 
impeding surface wa ter flows and preserve the storage of surface water to avoid 
exacerbation of flood risk in the wider catchment. The Report concluded that 
Sequential and Exception Tests are required  for this site . The document should 
be considered as part of the further si te-specific flood -risk assessment that will 
be required for any planning application .

 Strat egic Policy CEM 1 – Land north of Marston Lane, 
Bedworth  
 
Introduction  
 
7.130 To ensure that there is sufficient burial space to meet the Borough’s need up to 
2039 and beyond, it is necessary to safeguard land for use as cemetery burial 
grounds.  
 
 
 
Strategic Policy CEM1 – Land north of Marston Lane, Bedworth  
 
Allocation CEM1 will be safeguarded for use as cemetery burial grounds to serve 
the Borough’s long -term burial needs. Alternative green -belt compatible uses that 
preserve the openness of the Green Belt, such as playing pitch provision, will be 
considered a cceptable where they will facilitate the development of the wider land 
allocation for burial space.  
  
Key development principles  
 
1. Phasing of the development commencing from the north of the site.  
2. Provision of a suitable stand -off of at least 10m from the Coventry Canal. This 
buffer is to be planted with native species in order to enhance the benefits of 
the canal as a wildlife corridor.  
3. Retention of existing hedgerows and hedgerow trees where possible.  
 Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
101 
 4. Sensitive design and location of ancillary infrastruc ture (e.g. roads, pathways 
etc) in order to preserve the openness of the Green Belt.  
 
 
7.131 Latest evidence shows that there is around 7 years’ worth  of operational burial 
space left in the Borough . Therefore , additional provision is required.  
 
7.132 In the event that the existing playing pitch provision, immediately north of 
Marston Lane Cemetery, is required to be used to deliver burial space in the 
short -term, the use of the CEM1 land to deliver alternative playing pitch 
provision will be consider an acceptable use. However, this should be delivered 
prior to the loss of the existing playing field site , to the north of Marston Lane 
Cemetery , unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the use is no longer 
required in the area.  Consideration s hould also be given to visitor parking, in 
relation to any increase in playing field provision in terms of size and /or use for 
formalised sports facilities.

 8.0 Housing  
 
8.1 The following policies set out the requirements for housing provision, including 
meeting the needs for Gypsies and Travellers.  
 
Policy H1 – Range and mix of housing  
 
 
General market housing  
 
Development is required to provide an appropriate mix of housing types  and sizes 
based on the need and demand identified in t he most up -to-date HEDNA or 
equivalent. There is currently an imbalance of dwelling types within the Borough 
which the Council will seek to re -address by actively promoting the delivery of 
housing schemes, where the housing mix proposed aligns with the identified needs 
and demands, of the Borough, in the HEDNA.   
 
Homes for older people  
 
Development of extra care housing, residential care homes and other housing 
options, which allow older people to stay in their own homes, will be  supported  where 
a local need can be demonstrated. These types of buildings will need to comply with 
M4(3) higher Building Regulations standards and will be strongly encouraged to 
adhere with the emerging Warwickshire County Council Technical  guidance for 
Specialised Supported housing and Housing with Care developments.  
 
Other specialised housing  
 
Development proposals for specialised housing and care accommodation will be 
supported  where a local need can be demonstrated. These types of buildings will 
need to comply with M4(3) higher Building Regulations standards and will be 
encouraged to adhere with the emerging Warwickshire County Council Technical  
guidance for Specialised Supporte d housing and Housing with Care developments.  
 
Self-build  and custom build homes  
 
Development proposals for self-build  and custom build homes will be supported 
where they are sustain ably located and subject to compliance with the development 
plan policies as a whole.   
 
 
8.2  The NPPF indicates that the Council should plan for a mix of housing based on 
current and future demographic trends, market trends,  the needs of different 
groups in the community and for new and flexible working practices. The 
Council should identify the size, type and range required by the local population 
over the plan period.  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
103 
 8.3 This policy gives guidance on the size and type of d wellings for general market 
housing, the housing needs of the older population and the population with 
specific needs.  
 
General market housing  
 
8.4 A range of types and sizes of housing is needed to redress imbalances of 
specific types and sizes in order to meet the needs of changing household 
structures and to meet the aspirations for the Borough.  
 
8.5 The sub -regional HEDNA (2022) makes recommendations about the size of 
dwellings for mark et and affordable housing in the Borough, taking account of 
a range of factors that influence demand including demographic changes and 
market factors. It suggests the following requirements:  
 
 1 
bedroom  2 
bedrooms  3 
bedrooms  4+ 
bedrooms  
Market  10% 35% 45% 10% 
 
Table 11: Market housing (%) – sub-regional HEDNA (2022).  
 
8.6 In terms of market housing, the most significant demand is for two and three -
bedroom properties, but it is acknowledged that in the market sector, 
households are able to buy or rent property of any size subject to what they can 
afford. Development proposals should deliver a housing mix in line with the 
recommendations in the most up -to-date version of the HEDNA.  
 
8.7 In the past, the business commun ity have raised concerns about the lack of 
‘executive’ or ‘aspirational’ homes in the Borough, and the impact that this has 
on attracting potential business investors to the area. This is reflected in the 
comparatively low number of properties in higher council tax bands in the 
Borough, although housing developments in recent years have deli vered more 
3, 4 and 5 -bedroom houses. Such housing will be considered favourably, 
provided that the mix of housing is within the ranges indicated in the HEDNA.  
 
8.8 Developers will also need to consider the character of the local area, 
surrounding the site , in terms of the types and sizes of new housing.  
 
Older people  
 
8.9 The number of older people, both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of 
the population, is increasing significantly and is expected to continue to do so. 
The draft HEDNA (May 2022) projects the following population changes in the 
Borough for those over 60.  
 
 
 
 
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
104 
  2021  2039  Change in 
households  % change  
60-64 4,711  4,786  75 1.6 
65-69 4,434  5,401  967 21.8 
70-74 4,640  5,668  1,027  22.1 
75-79 3,691  4,700  1,010  27.4 
80-84 2,599  3,549  950 36.5 
85 and over 2,090  3,620  1,530  73.2 
 
Table 12: Projected population changes – Draft HEDNA (2022).  
 
8.10 It is important to provide appropriate local housing options for an increasingly 
older population who may have poor health. Maintaining independence and 
giving people the choice to remain in their own homes is a national and local 
aim. Many will want to re main in their existing homes, but others may want to 
downsize to general market housing, or to use supported specialist housing 
such as sheltered housing, extra care housing or residential care.  
 
8.11 In recent years, nationally there has been a move away  from a reliance on 
residential and nursing care and  a focus on providing households with care in 
their own home through the provision of care within general needs housing or 
extra -care housing.  Extra care housing is  safe, secure, well designed and 
attract ive self -contained accommodation for older people aged 55 and over, 
who require varying levels of care and support, designed to enable them to live 
independently in a home environment. T herefore, the higher Building 
Regulations of M4(3) is considered appro priate as well as adherence to the 
emerging Warwickshire County Council Technical  guidance for Specialised 
Supported housing and Housing with Care developments.  
 
8.12 The HEDNA provides an indicative assessment of specialist housing need for 
2022 – 2023. It indicates that the Borough would need to make provision for 
647 dwellings with support and 506 dwellings with care, which includes a higher 
affordable housing need i n Nuneaton and Bedworth compared with the other 
Warwickshire authorities in  the Housing Market Area . There is also a need for 
503 additional nursing and residential care bedspaces.  ‘Policy H2 – Affordable 
housing’ sets out the requirement for affordable h ousing provision and will apply 
to extra care housing.  
 
8.13 As set out in ‘Policy TC3 – Hierarchy of centres  (including district and local 
centres) ’, homes for older people should be located in close proximity to town 
centres and key services, such as hospitals, and should have access to the 
public transport network.  
 
People with a disability  
 
8.14 Data from the 2011 Census indicates that the Borough has the highest 
proportion (35.4%) of households across Coventry and Warwickshire  with one 
or more perso ns with a long -term health problem or disability. It is recognised 
that the level of people with health or disability problems is closely linked to the 
level of the older population, with 57.1% of the population aged 65 having a  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
105 
 long-term health problem or  disability within the Borough. ‘Policy H5 – 
Accessible and adaptable homes’ addresses the need for housing which is 
wheelchair accessible.  
 
Self and custom -built housing  
 
8.15 In line with the Self -Build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015, the Council 
maintains a register of sites suitable for self and custom -built housing. The 
Council will continue to maintain its register and support appropriate proposals 
to deliver service plots for self-build  and custom build housing in sustainable 
locations . 
 
Borough Plan objectives   
 
8.16 This policy delivers the following Borough Plan objective:  
 
• Strategic o bjective 4.  
 
Evidence base  
 
8.17 The evidence base related to this policy is as follows:  
 
• Iceni Projects (2022). Draft Nuneaton and Bedworth HEDNA.  
• Iceni Projects (2022). Coventry and Warwickshire Sub -regional HEDNA.  
 
Delivery mechanisms  
 
8.18 The delivery mechanisms for this policy are as follows:  
 
• Work with the Council’s Housing team to identify a suitable mix of dwelling 
types and sizes for individual sites.  
• Work with the Council’s Housing team to update the Housing Strategy.  
• Work with the Council’s Housing team, Warwickshire County Council and 
other service providers to identify specific needs for the older population, 
vulnerable adults and young people with disabilities.  
• Maintain a register of suitable sites for those interested in self and custom -
built homes.  
 
Monitoring  
 
8.19 The indicators and targets that will be monitored for this policy are outlined in 
Table 13.

Table 13: Indicators and targets to be monitored for Policy H1.  
 
Policy H2 – Affordable housing  
 
 
Proportion of affordable housing  
 
The Council is committed to improving housing affordability in Nuneaton and 
Bedworth Borough. The Council will seek at least 25% of new dwellings to be 
delivered as affordable where residential development proposals consist of 15 
dwellings or more. For res idential development proposals that consist of between, 
11 to 14 dwellings, a contribution of two affordable housing units will be required, 
irrespective of any demolitions.  
 
Tenure Mix and First Homes  
 
National policy requires 10% of the total number of homes on a development site to 
be allocated for affordable home ownership (unless the proposal meets one of the 
exemption tests in the NPPF). Accounting for the contribution from First Homes, the 
remainder of the affordable home ownership is to be delivere d as shared ownership, 
or as specified in the Council’s latest published Affordable Housing SPD.   
 
Current national requirements are that 25% of the total affordable housing 
requirement are provided under the First Homes scheme. The Council ’s local 
eligib ility criteria for First Homes  is provided in the supporting text for this policy.  
 
In addition to the First Home requirement set out above, the remainder of the 
affordable housing requirement is to be delivered as social or affordable rent.   For 
schemes of 11 to 14 dwellings, one First Home and one social rent /affordable rent 
property is to be provided.  
 
The tenure split and affordable housing mix sought will be based upon evidence and 
agreed on a site-by-site basis  by the Housing Team.  
 
Where nat ional policy requirements, relating to the First Homes Initiative or local 
eligibility criteria , are updated /altered, the latest requirements will be applicable.  
 
Design standards  
 
The Council will require developments to incorporate and suitably integrate  
affordable and market housing to a high design standard.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
107 
  
All affordable housing must meet the requirement for 95% of new dwellings to be 
M4(2) compliant and 5% to meet the M4(3) Building Regulations standards. All 
affordable units must include private o utdoor  amenity space for each property.  
 
On-site provision  
 
All affordable housing need should be met on -site, unless it can be robustly justified 
that on -site provision is neither feasible nor viable. Where developers consider 
applying the affordable housing policy is unviable, or where it is considered that a 
different mix would better suit local needs and site -specific circumstances, evidence 
and a Viability Statement must be included with the planning application stating the 
reasons.  
 
Exceptions  
 
Proposals which boost affordable housing delivery will be consider ed constructively 
in line with any updates to national policy. This includes First Home Exception Site 
proposals as set out in national guidance.  
 
Outside of settlement boundaries, housing development, in addition to those 
allocated within the Borough Plan  Review, will be supported on small rural exception 
sites, where affordable homes can be delivered to meet the needs of local people 
within the local communit y, where there is no conflict with other Borough Plan 
Review policies and the following criteria a re met:  
• The site is adjacent to existing settlement boundaries.  
• The proposed development is considered suitable by virtue of its size and 
scale in relation  to the surrounding settlement and its services and proximity 
to public transport links and infrastru cture.  
• The initial and subsequent occupancy of affordable homes is controlled 
through planning conditions and legal agreements, as appropriate, to ensure 
that the accommodation remains available in perpetuity to local people in 
affordable housing need.  
• The majority of the homes provided are affordable and where an element of 
market housing is required to enable the delivery of significant additional 
affordable housing, the element of market housing is the minimum amount 
required to enable the delivery of th e proposed affordable housing.  
 
Affordable housing SPD  
 
Proposals must consider how they accord with the requirements set out in the 
Council’s latest Affordable Housing SPD .  
 
 
8.20 The HEDNA assesses the Coventry and Warwickshire Housing Market Area 
and outlines the affordable housing requirements for the Borough.  
 
8.21 Evidence shows that whilst the cost of private market housing and rents across 
the Housing Market Area are generally low est in Nuneaton and Bedworth (and 
Coventry) there is still a significant affordable housing need in the Borough.  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
108 
 8.22 In addition, six of the eight super output areas in Warwickshire, ranked within 
the top 10% most deprived nationally, are located in Nuneaton and Bedworth38.  
Such high levels of disadvantage are reflected by the level of demand for 
Council owned housing in the Borough, which in May 2023  had a register of 
3,205 applicants.  
 
Proportion of affordable housing  
 
8.23 The HEDNA identifies an annual need of 391 affordable homes per annum.  
Work undertaken by DixonSearle Partnership in 20 23 identified that an 
affordable housing target of 25% was viable on developments of 15 dwellings 
or more.  
 
8.24 Where the calculation would  result in a fraction of a dwelling, the number will 
be rounded up. Based on the findings, the Council will also require two 
affordable units on sites where 11 -14 dwellings are proposed.  
 
8.25 In accordance with the latest national guidance, affordable housing  
contributions are not sought from developments of 10 dwellings or less.  
 
Tenure split  
 
8.26 To keep this policy up -to-date and flexible, the current targets for tenure split, 
as well as affordable housing mix, have been outlined in the supporting text 
rather than the policy itself. These targets may change over time to reflect new 
evidence and an y changes in Government policy regarding alternative 
affordable housing options.  
 
8.27 Based on the latest levels of housing need, evident from the Council’s Housing 
Register, the outputs of the HEDNA and national guidance, the most 
appropriate mix of affordab le housing provision is considered to be First Homes, 
shared ownership and affordable rent /social rent. Typically, social and 
affordable rent are broadly grouped, as both tenure types are likely to be 
provided by registered providers (or the Council) with some degree of subsidy 
and will be targeted at the same groups of households.  
 
8.28 It is expected that in order to calculate the tenure levels, the 25% requirement 
under First Homes is first subtracted from the affordable housing requirement 
followed by any additional affordable market housing ‘top -up’ required to ensure 
that the site maintains a total of 10% affordable home ownership provision 
(exceptions apply). The remaining homes are to be prioritised as affordable or 
social rent (the mix to be agreed on a site -by-site basis by the Housing Team).   
 
Affordable housing mix  
 
8.29 With regards to affordable housing sizes for Nuneaton and Bedworth, the 
Coventry and Warwickshire sub -regional HEDNA provides the modelled need 
for different types of affordable housing:

Affordable home 
ownership  25% 35% 30% 10% 
 
Table 14: Modelled need for different types of affordable housing – sub-regional HEDNA (2022).  
8.30 The emerging Housing Strategy for 2023 to 2028 is anticipated to be finalised 
by autumn 2023 and will also feed into these requirements. Developers are 
therefore encouraged to undertake pre -application consultation with the 
Council’s Housing Strategy Team to determine the most appropriate affordable 
housing mix for new developments.  
 
On-site provision  
 
8.31 The NPPF  promotes the creation of mixed and balanced communities, and to 
enable this , considers the provision of affordable housing is best met on -site, 
unless off -site provision or a financial contribution of broadly equivalent value 
can be robustly justified.  
 
8.32 Whilst the provision of affordable housing on -site is the Council’s preferred 
delivery mechanism, alternative delivery mechanisms may there fore be 
acceptable, where it can be robustly justified, and providing such alternatives 
can reasonably be expected to contribute to the creation of successful mixed 
communities.  
 
8.33 In such cases the Council and the developer may jointly agree on either  one or 
a combination of the following:  
 
• An alternative site to be provided by the developer for the provision of 
affordable housing.  
• A financial contribution from the developer  to the Council , to be used in 
connection with the development of affordable ho using. The financial 
contribution will broadly be the equivalent value of providing the affordable 
homes on -site. 
 
First Homes Initiative  
 
8.34 On 24th May 2021 the Government announced its First Homes Initiative39 to 
help meet the housing needs of first -time buyers . This came into effect on 28th 
June 2021. Under this scheme the first 25% of all affordable housing units must 
be delivered via this option and that is ‘topped up’ to ensure that 10% of the 
total number of houses on a site are provided in this method (exceptions apply). 
First Homes are a specific kind of discounted market sale housing. First Homes 
are discounted market sale units which:  
 
 
39 Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (2021). Guidance: First Homes.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
110 
 a. Must be discounted by a minimum of 30% against the market value.  
b. Are sold to a person or persons meeting the First Homes eligibility criteria.  
c. On their first sale, will have a restriction registered on the title at HM Land 
Registry to ensure this discount (as a percentage of current market value) 
and certain other restric tions are passed on at each subsequent title 
transfer.  
d. After the discount has been applied, the first sale must be at a price no 
higher than £250,000.  
 
8.35 First Homes will be secured via a Section 106 Legal Agreement in order to 
secure the delivery of th e First Homes and to ensure the legal restrictions are 
maintained under these requirements.  
 
8.36 To ensure these F irst Homes allow local people to get on the housing ladder in 
the local area, and in particular to ensure that key workers , providing essential 
services , are able to buy homes in the area , the following local eligibility criteria 
is applicable:  
 
• Have lived in the Borough for at least 6 out the last 12 months, or 3 out of 
the last 5 years.  
• Have immediate family in the Borough, with the family members concerned 
currently living in the Borough and have done so for at least 5 years or more. 
This would normally be parents, adult children, brothers or sisters provided 
there are sufficiently close  links in the form of frequent contact, commitment 
and dependence. Other family associations such as grandparents and 
adoptive parents would also be considered if sufficiently close links are 
evidenced.  
• Work permanently in the Borough; or  
• Give to, or receive support from, a close family member who is a resident in 
the Borough. Applicants will need to supply supporting evidence from a 
medical professional or social worker together with full details of the support 
that is being given /received .  
 
First Homes exception sites  
 
8.37 There are exceptions to the First Homes Initiative. An exception site must be 
proportionate to the existing settlement and is where a housing site comes 
forward on unallocated land outside of the strategic and non -strategic sites. 
These ‘Windfall’ sites can be within Green Belt and may use the First Homes 
Initiative exception test, defined within national guidance, in order to provide 
primarily First Homes. The requirement for any non -discounted market housing 
within t his, would require the submission of a Viability Assessment 
demonstrating that these are required.  
 
8.38 The Council has sought to ensure this policy can be revised in the future if 
substantial changes are required.

 Rural exception sites  
 
8.39 National planning policy allows new affordable housing to be permitted on rural 
exception sites to meet identified local needs. These sites would not normally 
be released for market housing and should seek to address the affordable 
housing need of the local community. A small number of market homes may be 
permitted at the discretion of the Borough Council, where essential to enable 
the delivery of affordable units without grant funding. This would need to be 
supported by l ocal housing need evidence. The provision of affordable housing 
on any ‘exception sites’ would need to continue in perpetuity and would prevent 
these sites becoming part of the private housing market over time.  
 
8.40 To support the delivery of market homes  on rural exception sites, an open book 
viability assessment should be submitted with the planning application. This will 
assist the Council in the decision -making  process.  
 
Affordable housing SPD  
 
8.41 The adopted SPD provides guidance on:  
 
• The design and location of affordable housing on site.  
• The provision of affordable housing that is not on site.  
• The use of Section 106 agreements and /or the Community Infrastructure 
Levy (or any new mechanism that may come into forc e).  
 
8.42 After the adoption of the Borough Plan Review, SPD’s will be reviewed and 
updated but in the interim they remail valid where they are consistent with the 
Borough Plan Review policy.

8.47 The Council has a duty under the Housing Act 2004 to assess the 
accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers and to demonstrate how that 
need will be met.  
 
8.48 The Government’s Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (2015) document aims to 
ensure fair and equal treatment for Gypsies and Travellers in a way that 
enables their traditional and nomadic way of life, while respecting the interests 
of the settled comm unity.  
 
8.49 The 2021 Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showperson Accommodation 
Assessment showed a need to find an overall requirement for 20 permanent 
pitches for the period up to 2036/37 (at least 6 permanent residential pitches by 
2025 and a further 5 between 2025 and 2037) and no need for transit pitches 
for the same period40. This need and how it would be met through the allocation

Policy H4 – Nationally Described Space Standards  
 
 
The Nationally Described Space Standards (NDSS) were first introduced in 2015 by 
the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, focusing on internal 
space standards within new dwellings. The standards can be viewed in the 
Technical Housing Standards (2015)41 or the Council’s Sustainable Design and 
Construction SPD (2020)42. Where assessment methods are changed or 
superseded, the appropriate replacement standards should be used.  
 
All residential dwellings should comply with the NDSS including any dwelling which 
does not fall within a C3 use class; for example, extra care accommodation, assisted 
living housing or houses in multiple occupation; or from change of use or conversion.

42 Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council (2020). Sustainable Design and Constructio n SPD.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
114 
 Where this requirement is believed to be unviable, written robust justification as to 
why this policy cannot be achieved, should be provided to the Council.  
 
 
8.54 The PPG  states that where internal space standards are identified and justified 
by a local planning authority, the need, viability and timing of implementing 
these internal space standards should be considered.  
 
8.55 In order to validate a planning application, relating to new residential 
development, the following should be submitted to the Council to ensure 
compliance with this policy:  
 
• Unit numbers.  
• Number of persons that can be accommodated (according to the number of 
single and double bedrooms).  
• The number of floors in the dwelling.  
• The minimum required floor space (according to the NDSS).  
• The proposed floor space.  
 
8.56 In terms of need, there has been growing public concern about the quality of 
new homes. House prices have risen in recent years, whilst a lack of choice 
and intense competition for new homes has become evident. Concer ns have 
been raised regarding developers reducing dwelling sizes in order to maximise 
value. In response to these concerns the NDSS was introduced in 2015, 
representing a benchmark for all new dwellings across the country and across 
tenures. However, conce rns regarding internal space standards have persisted 
since the introduction of the NDSS.  
 
8.57 In 2015, RIBA undertook a study entitled Space Standards for Homes43 which 
reported that half of all new homes remain ‘too small’ when measured against 
the min imum standards of the NDSS, whilst the size of 3 bedroom dwellings in 
the West Midlands averaged 85.7sq.m, 7.3sq.m . smaller than the 
recommended NDSS size of 93sq.m, and 2.3sq.m. smaller than the average 
for England of 88sq.m. Furthermore, in 2017 Julia Pa rk44 set out a 
comprehensive study of the importance of space in dwellings, reporting on the 
need for minimum space standards to ensure dwellings and bedrooms are large 
enough for the intended level of occupancy.  
 
8.58 Focusing on the effects of space on health and wellbeing, the following themes 
were identified in several studies since 2015:  
 
• Mental health – There are strong links between small, cramped living 
conditions and poor mental health.  
• Physical health – Studies have identified links between overc rowded 
housing and a number of health conditions.  
• Family relationships – Stress and tensions between family members are 
worsened where insufficient space is available.

44 Julia Park (2017). One hundred years of housing space standards.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
115 
 • Education – Adequacy of space helps children to engage in uninterrupted 
private study and achieve their potential.  
• Work from home productivity – Adequacy of space helps with the 
effectiveness of working from home but also helps separate work and home 
life. 
• Changing physical requirements over people’s lifetimes – Homes need 
space to respond to changing needs and lifestyles. A 3 -bedroom home with 
under -sized bedrooms may seem fine for pre -school children but turn s out 
to be wholly inadequate for older children as the family matures.  
• Aggressive and anti -social behaviour is associated wi th overcrowding.  
 
8.59 From a health and wellbeing point of view, the need for minimum internal space 
standards, at a national level, is evident.  
 
8.60 The Council’s Borough Plan policies seek to maximise development potential 
and utilise available land in  the most efficient way, whilst achieving sustainable 
development and respecting local character and heritage. However, it is also 
important to ensure that achieving higher density development does not 
compromise space standards and living conditions for r esidents. The Borough 
Plan Review sets a housing provision requirement of at least 9,690 homes to 
be brought forward, in the Borough, over the plan period to 2039.  
 
8.61 Evidence on the Borough’s  objectively assessed housing need indicates that 
for market housing and affordable housing (affordable rent and shared 
ownership) the majority of future demand is likely to be for two and three 
bedroom homes (35% and 45% respectively) reflecting demand for housing 
from younger people and families. There is also lik ely to be some demand for 
medium sized homes from older households looking to downsize but still retain 
flexibility for friends and family to come and stay. The analysis also indicates 
that the demand for smaller one bedroom dwellings and four -bedroom 
dwellings is lower (10% in both cases). Therefore, the current development 
trends in the Borough indicate a need for strong policy to ensure that new 
residential development meets minimum internal space standards, as set out 
in the NDSS.  
 
8.62 In terms of viab ility, this has been tested  in the Viability Assessment, produced 
by DixonSearle Partnership (2023) . 
 
8.63 In terms of timing, the NDSS was first mentioned in Nuneaton and Bedworth’s 
Sustainable Design and Construction SPD (2020) and during the Preferred 
Options stage of th e Borough Plan Review, in June 2022. These documents 
set out the intention to introduce t he NDSS in the Borough, as part of local 
planning policy. It is considered that the internal space standards will form part 
of the reviewed Borough Plan, once adopted, and the requirement to comply 
with the NDSS will come into force in 2024. The Council co nsiders this to 
provides a sufficient transition and notice period for developers, to consider the 
impacts of this new requirement in the Borough.

 Policy H5 – Accessible and adaptable homes 
 
 
New major residential developments should include the following proportions of 
accessible and adaptable dwellings as defined in Part M Volume 1 of the Building 
Regulations45: 
 
• 95% of all new dwellings should meet M4(2) standards.  
• 5% of all new dwellings should meet M4(3) standards.  
 
All new major residential developments  should meet these M4(2) and M4(3) 
standards unless  robust justification can be provided as to why these types of 
dwellings would be unviable or physically impossible, due to a lack of level access, 
on the development site (for example, due to steep topography or the cost of lift 
installation). Flood Risk Assessments should be utilised, in order to understand the 
most viable location of M4(3) dwellings, in areas of lowest flood risk, and how the 
safety of occupiers can be ensured.  
 
The mix, size, type and tenure of M4(3) dwellings should reflect the rest of  the 
dwellings, to be brought forward on the development site, unless local need 
indicates otherwise.  
 
M4(3) dwellings should normally be built to an ‘adaptable’ standard, unless the 
Council will be nominating an occupier, in which case they should be accessible for 
a wheelchair using occupier.  
 
If the required number of M4(3) dwellings, to be built on a d evelopment site, 
produces an even quantity, half should  be provided as affordable housing and half 
should be provided as  market housing. Where an odd quantity is to be developed, 
affordable housing provision should be favoured – evidence indicates a higher  need 
for wheelchair users in the social sector (50% for affordable and 19% for market46). 
For example, if 15 M4(3) dwellings are proposed, 7 should be provided for market 
housing and 8 for affordable housing provision. This preference will  be subject to 
the viability of the development.  
 
Drawings must be submitted illustrating the M4(2) and M4(3) dwellings, including  
the adaptable or accessible measures implemented on -site, alongside their location 
on the development site.  
 
 
8.68 The Council believes that people should have the opportunity to stay in their 
family homes for as long as possible. Making homes adaptable for changing 
and unforeseen circumstances provides families and individuals with the choice 
of staying in their existing home, wh ilst reducing the burden of excessively high 
building costs to retrofit properties, in order to meet such needs and reduce the 
need to relocate.

8.69 In Nuneaton and Bedworth, 8.5% of people, classified as disabled under the 
Equality Act (2010), indicated that their day -to-day activities were limited a lot, 
in the 2021 Census47, whilst 10.9% reported that their day -to-day activities were 
limited a little. Additionally, in Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough, 27% of 
households are home to 1 disabled person, under the Equality Act (2010), and 
6.6% are home to 2 or more disabled people48. This compares to 25.7% and 
6.8% respectively in Coventry and 25.4% and 6.6% in England. In Augu st 2022, 
2,819 people claimed Attendance Allowance, in the Borough, whilst 3,124 
claimed Disability Living Allowance and 7,861 claimed Personal Independence 
Payment (January 2023)49.  
 
8.70 In 2023, 19.7% of Nuneaton and Bedworth’s population was reported to be over 
6550. This is projected to increase to 20.9% in 2030 and 21.9% in 2035 before 
slightly decreasing to 21.7% in 2043. It is becoming increasingly important to 
provide housing for older people, with life expectancies increasing and in turn, 
the qua ntity of older people in the population. Offering older people a better 
choice of accommodation to suit their changing needs can help them live 
independently for longer, feel more connected to their communities and help 
reduce costs to the social and healt h care systems.  
 
8.71 In 2011, 35.4% of Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough’s households had at least 
one resident with a long -term limiting illness or disability compared with 29.8% 
for Warwickshire, 35.3% for the West Midlands  and 32.7% for England51. 
Further more, large increases in the number of older people with dementia 
(increasing by 21%) and mobility problems (up 20%)52 are projected between 
2022 -2032.  
 
8.72 The data presented suggests that there is a clear need to increase the supply 
of accessible and adaptable dwellings and wheelchair user dwellings, as well 
as providing specific provisions for older persons housing. Given the evidence, 
the Coventry and Warwickshire HEDNA53 suggested that the Council could 
consider requiring 95% of dwell ings (of all tenures) to meet the M4(2) standards 
and 5% of homes to meet M4(3) standards. These are the standards required 
in this Borough Plan policy. Furthermore, in seeking M4(2) compliant homes, 
the Council should be mindful that such homes could be c onsidered as ‘homes 
for life’ and would be suitable for any occupant, regardless of whether or not 
they have a disability at the time of initial occupation.

 Part M Volume 1 of the Building Regulations: M4(3) Standards  
 
8.73 The English Housing Survey sho wed that in 2011/12 there was 184,000 
households in England with a wheelchair user and the oldest person in the 
household was aged under 6054. In turn, the 2011 Census showed a household 
population of 40.6 million people aged under 6055 and therefore, a base 
prevalence rate of 0.005 – essentially for every 1000 people aged under 60 
there are around 5 wheelchair user households.  
 
8.74 In Warwickshire, the estimated number of wheelchair users was 8,755 in 2022, 
projected to increase to 10 ,437 by 203256. However, this does not indicate how 
many homes might be needed for this group – some households will be living 
in a home that is suitable for wheelchair use, whilst others may need 
improvements to accommodation or a move to an alternative h ome. The 
Coventry and Warwickshire HEDNA (2022)57 suggests that the current annual 
need for wheelchair user homes, in Nuneaton and Bedworth, is 58 with a 
projected need of 35, for the period 2022 -2032. This equates to 24.5% of 
Nuneaton and Bedworth’s housi ng need.  
 
8.75 The estimated need for wheelchair user homes, for 2022 -2032, is projected to 
be 19% for market housing and 50% for affordable housing (affordable rent and 
shared ownership). This Borough Plan requires 95% of new residential 
developments to c omply with M4(2) building standards and 5% with M4(3) 
building standards. In both the market and affordable sectors, dwellings should 
be delivered as M4(2) adaptable dwellings, unless the Council is nominating a 
potential occupier and then the dwelling sho uld be made M4(3) accessible. It is 
recognised however, that this will not be possible on all development sites and 
this policy should be applied flexibly.  
 
8.76 The Coventry and Warwickshire HEDNA58 states that the Council could seek a 
requirement of 10 -15% for M4(3) compliant dwellings, in relation to new market 
housing, whilst around a third of affordable housing could potentially meet this 
requirement. These figures reflect that not all sites woul d be able to deliver 
homes of this type but are shown to be higher than the requirements of this 
planning policy. The Borough Plan Review Viability Assessment (2023), 
produced by DixonSearle Partnership, analys es the viability of providing M4(2) 
and M4(3) compliant dwellings, on new residential developments. The Viability 
Assessment tested and found sound, a requirement of 95% M4(2) dwellings 
and 5% M4(3) dwellings. This policy (Policy H5) reflects the Viability 
Assessment’s findings, ensuring the viability  of this policy over the plan period.  
 
8.77 Overall, this policy ensures that adaptable homes will be available for all 
individuals with a temporary or permanent physical impairment, providing 
people with choice, flexibility and independence, as well as pr omoting high 
quality and thoughtful housing design for the general population.

 9.0 Employment  
 
9.1 The following policies outline the requirements for employment growth and 
proposals.  
 
Policy E1 – Nature of employment growth  
 
 
Applications for economic uses, focusing particularly on use classes E(g )(ii and iii), 
B2 and B8 on the strategic employment sites and the portfolio of existing 
employment sites will be approved subject to them satisfactorily meeting the policies 
in the plan.  Applications which can demonstrate any of the following will be  approved 
subject to them satisfactorily meeting the relevant policies in the Borough Plan : 
 
1. Inward investment development, providing high quality and high -density 
employment opportunities.  
2. Employment sectors in line with those prioritised in the Economic 
Development Strategy, which include:  
a. Advanced manufacturing and sustainable technologies, particularly 
electric vehicle and battery production.  
b. Professional services . 
c. Research and development.  
d. Small to medium enterprise manufacturing . 
e. Diversification of fa rm/agricultural buildings to light  industrial /workshop 
units . 
3. The generation of permanent jobs that will help diversify the local economy.  
4. Major planning applications for new employment development (including 
change of use and the expansion of existing operations) should demonstrate 
how job opportunities arising from the proposed development will be made 
accessible to the Borough’s residents,  particularly those areas identified as 
the most income deprived in the Borough. In this regard applicants will be 
expected to give consideration to a range of measures including:  
a. Enhancement of the accessibility of the development to residents by a      
choice of means of transport.  
b. Developments must be well designed to accommodate the needs of all 
transport modes and must be fully integrated with existing transport 
networks.  
c. The provision of support to residents in applying for jobs arising from the 
deve lopment.  
d. The provision of training opportunities to assist residents in accessing 
employment opportunities and address skill deficits in the local 
population.  
e. Childcare provision which enables residents to access employment 
opportunities.  
f. Measures to assis t those with physical or mental health disabilities to 
access employment opportunities.  
 
E(g(i))  office proposals in the first instance should be directed to Nuneaton and 
Bedworth Town Centres. Ancillary E(g(i)) office proposals outside of these town  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan

 centres, but within an employment site, will be approved  subject to them 
satisfactorily meeting the relevant policies in the Borough P lan.  
 
Where applications for non -B and E(g (ii and iii )) use class proposals are put forward 
on the portfolio of existing employment sites the following should be addressed:  
 
5. Level of economic development being generated (economic development 
uses cover a wide spectrum of areas but excludes housing). It should  be 
noted that in the first instance main town centre uses should be directed to 
the town centres in line with ‘Policy TC3 – Hierarchy of centres  (including

9.2 Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough is a £2 billion economy which accounts for 
7% of the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the sub region of Coventry and 
Warwickshire. Since 2012 the GVA growth of the Borough has outperformed 
that of the Coventry and Warwickshire sub -region . Important sectors of the local 
economy are manufacturing, transport, warehousing, and retail. Manufacturing 
accounts for 22% of GVA within the Borough with similar contributions for 
logistics and retail59.  
 
9.3 The automotive sector has contributed  26% GVA growth over the 2012 -19 
period, highlighting the historic and geographical links the Borough has with the 
car industry. Other key growth areas in the period are public administration, 
education and health, utilities, motor vehicle trade and logist ics60. 
 
9.4 The Borough had approximately 54,800 jobs in 2019 accounting for 10.4% of 
jobs in the sub -region. Manufacturing accounts for 11.2% of employment in the 
Borough. Compared to the sub -region there is a higher proportion of 
employment from public administration and  health, possibly signifying a weaker 
private sector business base. Higher value service sectors are under -
represented when compared to the sub -region, indicating the difficulty in 
attracting these sectors to the Borough from areas such as Coventry and

 Stratford -on-Avon. The under representation of these high value sectors affects 
the Borough’s overall productivity performance.  
 
9.5 GVA economic growth in the Borough has been strong . However , economic 
productivity is GVA per job of £36,800 which is the lowe st in the region , with an 
overall average of £51,40061. This is a measure of the relative productivity of 
the local economy and quality of jobs. As such, a key focus for Nuneaton and 
Bedworth Borough Council is improving the socio -economic prospects of the 
Borough’s residents through economic initiatives and the Council’s revised 
Economic Development Strategy.  
 
9.6  The type of growth that will deliver employment development is also significant 
for the Borough Plan. The Borough has high levels of out -commuting, an over 
dependency on manufacturing and distribution, as well as a low skills base62. 
 
9.7 The NPPF63 states economic policies should have regard to Local Industrial 
Strategies and other local policies for economic development and regeneration. 
The Council has an adopted Economic Development Strategy which sets out 
the Council’s vision, strategic objectiv es, and priorities for the Borough’s 
economy. The document is currently being updated . The draft Economic 
Development Strategy  identifies several key economic objectives which are 
addressed in the policy, these include:   
 
• Assist local businesses to benefit from and adapt to central Government 
policies regarding CO 2 reduction.  
• Promote a high level of connectivity including a strong transport network.  
• Ensure a range of flexible industrial space is available balancing competin g 
demands across industries.  
 
9.8 The Council will also seek to attract wider investment through the Economic 
Development Strategy.  
 
9.9 An on -going issue for the Borough is its skills base, although there has been a 
level of improvement. Therefore, the policy seeks to support the development 
of education establishments in order to assist with the continual improvement 
by ensuring facilities are in place during the plan period.  
 
9.10 Economic disparity between the wards in the Borough is an  issue to be 
addressed. According to the Office of National Statistics64, in 2019 13.6%  of the 
population of Nuneaton and Bedworth was income deprived. Of the 316 local 
authorities in England,  Nuneaton and Bedworth  is ranked  97th most income 
deprived. 15 o f the 81 neighbourhoods in Nuneaton and Bedworth were among 
the 20 % most income deprived in England. Conversely, 14 neighbourhoods

124 
 were among the 20 % least income deprived in England. The most income 
deprived neighbourhoods are located in the wards of Abbe y, Camp Hill, Galley 
Common, Kingswood, Poplar and Wembrook. Therefore, the Council will seek 
to ensure applicants engage with local stakeholders and community groups and 
to actively promote vacancies and training opportunities in income deprived 
areas.  
 
9.11 Within the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority’s Strategic Transport 
Plan (2016), there are a number of policies promoting ‘Economic Growth and 
Economic Inclusion’. These promote improvements in transport infrastructure 
including Rapi d Transit, improved bus services and enhanced walking and 
cycling measures, alongside policies to improve junction pinch points. 
Investments in such infrastructure are considered throughout this plan and will 
serve new employment sites, to enable new trave l demands to be met 
successfully through sustainable forms of travel. As such, new development 
must be well designed to accommodate the needs of all transport modes and 
must be fully integrated with existing transport networks. Sustainable travel 
improveme nts will then allow employment sites to be developed, enabling new 
travel demand s to be met by sustainable forms of travel.  
 
9.12 In Nuneaton and Bedworth 35.4% of households have at least one resident with 
a long -term limiting illness or disability compar ed with 29.8% for Warwickshire, 
35.3% for the West Midlands and 32.7% for England. In August 2022, 2,819 
people claimed Attendance Allowance, in the Borough, whilst 3,124 claimed 
Disability Living Allowance and 7,861 claimed Personal Independence 
Payment ( January 2023)65. The Council will encourage applicants to engage 
with local stakeholders and community groups to actively promote vacancies 
and training opportunities and assist those with physical or mental health 
disabilities in applying for vacancies.  
 
9.13 The Town and Cou ntry Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 was updated on 1 
September 2020. Use classes were modified and the previous B1 uses can 
now be found in a more general commercial, business and service class, use 
class E. Within this new use class are retail and leis ure uses, that by virtue of 
being in the same use class , could be convert ed to offices and vice versa. The 
Council will monitor the impact of the new use class regarding the amount of 
office space lost or gained. The removal of this permitted change may ha ve to 
be considered to retain offices for that specific use in order to ensure that office 
availability is maintained66.

Policy E2 – Existing employment estates  
 
 
The redevelopment and/or expansion of existing employment sites, listed in Table 
19 (as shown on the policies map), for use class E(g)(ii) and B use classes will be 
supported.  
 
Where existing sites become vacant or are unlikely to serve a role for employment, 
the Council will work in partnership to secure an appropriate alternative re -use. The 
partnership working will be driven by the Council’s Economic Development Strategy.  
 
The sites listed in Table 20 and shown in Appendix L (as well as on the policies 
map), will not be protected from non -economic development type proposals. These 
sites are considered acceptable for alternative uses during the plan period.  
 
Proposals on protected employment sites for non -employment uses must 
demonstrate how they meet the following tests:  
 
a. Is the site allocated for employment land?  
b. Is there an adequate supply of allocated employment sites of sufficient quality in 
the locality (the relevant settlement within the Borough) to cater for a range of 
business requirements?  
c. Is the site capable of being serviced by a catchment population of s ufficient size?  
d. Is there evidence of active marketing for a period of at least 24 months?  
e. Could employment redevelopment be brought forward, taking account of site 
characteristics (including physical factors, accessibility and neighbouring uses) 
and would redevelopment be viable? If employment redevelopment is not viable, 
could mixed use redevelopment be brought forward?  
f. If firms are likely to be displaced through redevelopment, is there a supply of 
alternative suitable accommodation in the locality to help  support local 
businesses and jobs? Would this promote or hinder sustainable communities 
and travel patterns?  
 
 
9.18 To support existing businesses located in the Borough, it is important to protect 
and enhance existing employment estates. In May 2023, as part of the ‘Review 
of Nuneaton and Bedworth  Employment Land Portfolio’67, Iceni Projects 
assessed the employment sites in the Borough of 0.25 ha and above. The 
assessment identified those employment sites which are fit for purpose over 
the plan period or require investment to remain part of the employment land 
portfolio, and those which should be removed from the portfolio. Those 
assessed as high  quality estates or in need of investment, are identified as

 existing employment estates on the proposals map and are listed in Table 1 9. 
These sites will be given protection against non -economic type development. 
Estates identified as not being suitable fo r future employment purposes, listed 
in Table 20, will not be protected68.

9.19 During the life of the Borough Plan , it was expected that approximately 5.35ha69 
of employment land could be lost by 2039 as a consequence of this policy. 
Therefore, this was added to the allocation of the employment land target.  
 
9.20 The NPPF states that policies should be “flexible enough to accommodate 
needs not anticipated in the plan, allow for new and flexible working practices 
(such as live -work accommodation), and to enable a rapid response to changes 
in economic circumstances ”70. The policy allows for alternative uses  on 
employment sites, that are not protec ted, in accordance with the Borough Plan . 
However, for proposals on protected employment sites for non -employment 
uses, the assumption is that these sites are protected. To assist in the 
determination of this, a number of criteria are contained within the policy which 
will assist in ensuring that employment estates maintain their employment 
integrity.  
 
9.21 The Coventry & Warwickshire Sub -Regional Employment Market Signals 
Study71 (2019) was commissioned to provide a high -level analysis regarding 
the market for employment land within the Coventry and Warwickshire sub -
region. The Study recommended several key points which are addressed in the 
policy:  
 
• Strengthening the rules such th at policies across all authorities would 
prohibit a change of use from employment unless it can be evidenced.  
• Consideration should also be given to improving /expanding existing estates, 
rather than a change of use.  
 
9.22 When considering evidence of active  marketing of employment sites, proposed 
for non -employment sites, there is a requirement for  active marketing for two

Development within the town centres will need to support the aspirations of the 
Transforming Nuneaton72 and Transforming Bedworth initiatives73. 
 
Use classes defined in Annex  2 of the NPPF74 as ‘main town centre uses’ will be 
considered acceptable for the town centres.   
 
Proposals delivering new retail, leisure and office floor space will be supported 
where they contribute to the delivery of the requirements and recommendations set 
out in the Retail, Leisure and Office Study (2022) or any more up -to-date studies.  
 
This policy is to be read in conjunction with any future Town Centre SPDs.  
  
 
Transforming Nuneaton and Bedworth initiatives  
10.2 Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council and Warwickshire County Council 
are working together to deliver the regeneration and transformation of both 
Nuneaton and Bedworth Town Centres to achieve new mixed used 
development aimed at boosting economic growth in the town and providing new 
employment opportunities, using publicly owned land. This requires working 
closely with private and public sector partners, investors and developer s to 
ensure it meets the ambitions of the towns. The vision, ambition and aspiration 
for Bedworth Town Centre may see a brand -new civic theatre and library built 
in the heart of the town, whereas for Nuneaton the vision is to provide a hotel, 
entertainment  including a cinema, multistorey car park, food hall, public bars, 
restaurants and shopping areas, new college facilities and new living 
accommodation.   
 
Town centre requirements  
 
10.3  The NPPF  states that planning policies should support the role of town centres, 
as well as setting out policies for the management and adaptation of town 
centres over the plan period. As the previous town centre growth figures, 
proposed in the Borough Plan, were b ased on the Regional Spatial Strategy, it

 was necessary to assess whether these figures were still appropriate for the 
Borough.  
 
10.4 The Council commissioned Cushman and Wakefield to undertake an updated 
Retail, Leisure and Office Study (2022). This took  account of the latest data, 
trends and analysis covering issues such as the Covid -19 global pandemic, 
Brexit and more localised (sub -regional, Borough -wide and local) market trends 
and changes.  
 
10.5 For Nuneaton Town Centre, the study75 identifies a need for 1,050sq.m . of 
convenience retail floorspace and predicts a potential loss of 3,100sq.m . of 
comparison retail floorspace, up to 2039. This indicates a need to reconsider 
the role and function of Nuneaton Town Centre and move away from  more 
traditional comparison retail uses to ensure its future vitality and viability. The 
study also identifies potential to expand the food and beverage offer (including 
but not limited to pubs /bars and restaurants), within the Borough, potentially 
enhanc ing the night -time economy of Nuneaton Town Centre. Current 
provisions are mostly limited to independent cafes, takeaways and restaurants. 
However, recent demand has shifted to more experience -based activities, such 
as bars offering additional entertainmen t elements, e.g.  bowling or golf, 
alongside ‘pop -up’ restaurants and street food traders /halls. Furthermore, the 
study states that the leisure offer in Nuneaton Town Centre could diversify, 
complementing the Transforming Nuneaton initiatives such as the Ab bey Street 
development comprising of a hotel, cinema and food hall.  In terms of office 
requirements, the study concludes that there is a requirement for high quality 
‘easy in /easy out ’ flexible office space for its existing small business population, 
to suit their operational needs, as well as more conventional ‘front door ’ office 
space for local businesses /small and medium sized enterprises to grow into or 
consolidate. Cushman and Wake field also conducted a household telephone 
survey, as part of the Retail, Leisure and Office study (2022), comprising of 
1,203 telephone interviews across 12 catchment zones. Suggested 
improvements to Nuneaton’s existing leisure offer by respondents, focus ed on 
providing more activities for children, enhancing greenspaces and facilitating 
more cafes, restaurants and bars.  
 
10.6 For Bedworth Town Centre, the study identifies a slightly higher need for 
1,550sq.m . of convenience retail floorspace and a potenti al predicted loss of  
500sq.m . of comparison retail floorspace, up to 2039. Like Nuneaton, the study 
concludes that the town centre would benefit from a more comprehensive food 
and beverage offer, particularly to improve the night -time offer, as well as mor e 
activity or leisure -based uses to complement existing facilities. The future 
visioning work for Bedworth Town Centre should assist in enhancing 
Bedworth’s leisure offer. In terms of office need, this was not specified for 
Bedworth given existing provisio n, but any additional office space could feasibly 
improve the vibrancy and vitality of the town centre.  Suggested improvements 
to Bedworth’s existing leisure offer, by respondents to the household telephone 
survey conducted, focused on providing more activities for children, enhancing

 Policy TC2 – Nature of town centre growth  
 
 
Development principles  
 
Development within Nuneaton and Bedworth Town Centres will be expected to 
create a more accessible, well -connected and well -designed centre, with particular 
emphasis on linkages by walking, cycling and public transport. New development , 
within the town centre,  should mitigate and adapt for climate change; for instance, 
in response to potential for increased flooding and by reducing potential heat 
islands. Design that includes green areas for cooling, use of technology and 
materials for zero carb on emissions will be encouraged.  Appropriate enhancements 
will be promoted and sought to build upon existing green infrastructure assets and 
these enhancements will complement existing natural and historic assets that help 
define the town centres’ sense of  place and overall brand and identity.  
 
Developments relating to the evening and night -time leisure offer should 
demonstrate how they will create a safe and secure town centre environment.  
 
Nuneaton and Bedworth markets should be retained and enhanced and where 
appropriate, new markets should be introduced in the Borough.  
 
Defined town centres and primary shopping areas  
 
The town centre boundaries and primary shopping areas of the town centres are to 
be protected as defined in Appendix E and Appendix F. The  aim in defining 
boundaries will be to retain the predominance of town centre uses within these 
centres and sustain their primary shopping areas.  
 
Proposals for use classes defined in A nnex  2 of the NPPF76 as ‘main town centre 
uses’ will be supported  within the defined town centres  providing the proposal does 
not detrimentally impact the primary frontages  (The Council are intending to provide 
an Article 4 Direction in the future, in order to be able to remo ve some prior 
notification applications for these areas). Other uses will be permitted within the town 
centres where they do not undermine or adversely impact, either individually or 
cumulatively, the vitality, viability, character of the area and overall vision for the 
town centres  
 
Proposals that promote appropriately located tourism and heritage activities, to 
attract and sustain visitor numbers, will be supported.  
 
 
10.11 It is likely that a hybrid of town centre uses will be most appropriate in order to 
ensure the towns can readily react to the changes in trends and economy.  
 
10.12 Planning policies should be positive, promote competitive town centre 
environments and enco urage economic activity. Policies should be set for the 
management and growth of centres over the plan period. The town centre

 boundaries and primary shopping areas should be defined. It is important that 
needs for retail, including markets, leisure, offic e and other main town centre 
uses are met in full, and are not compromised by limited site availability.  
 
10.13  The Retail, Leisure and Office Study (2022)77 updates the previous Retail and 
Leisure Study Update (2014), Town Centre Office Requirements (2013) and the 
Convenience Goods Retail Study (2011). The study provides a more up -to-date 
strategic assessment of the quantitative and qualitative need for new retail 
(comparison and convenienc e goods) floor space, commercial leisure use and 
office space, in order to help maximise the potential of the Borough, particularly 
in terms of the main town centres. The updated study provides 
recommendations that reduce the figures provided, from previou s studies  to 
more realistic but still aspirational figures, in line with paragraph 16 of the NPPF.

Policy TC3 – Hierarchy of centres  (including d istrict and 
local centres ) 
 
 
The hierarchy set out in Table 24 should be used to undertake any Sequential 
Assessments for town centre uses  (including district and local centres) . 
 
Any new residential development should be within:  
 
1. 800m walking distance of a district or local centre (existing centre’s threshold 
can be outside the Borough’s administrative boundaries); and  
2. 8 minutes motor vehicle drive time to a district centre. Applications must 
demonstrate this on the basis of:  
a. Post development impact.  
b. During peak drive time.  
 
Where new residential development is proposed and the above thresholds are not 
met, the application should include the provision of a new district /local centre.  
 
Development within district or local centres wil l be considered acceptable in 
principle, subject to the following:  
 
3. The function, vitality and viability are maintained or improved.  
4. Contributes positively to the range of services on offer.  
5. Does not harm the amenities of local residents.  
6. Does not result i n the loss of ground floor retail /commercial floor space to 
residential use.

support their viability and vitality79. The Framework states that there should 
be a defined network and hierarchy of centres that can respond to rapid

 changes in the retail and leisure industries by allowing a suitable mix of uses 
(including housing) 80.  
 
10.19   The Retail,  Leisure and Office  Study Update (2022) assists in identifying 
Nuneaton as the primary shopping centre in the Borough. However, Bedworth 
is also a very important part of the retail hierarchy in the area. The study does 
identify differences in the number of facilities and uni ts within each centre. 
Consequently, the hierarchy differentiates the two centres based on the 
evidence.  
 
10.20   The Borough comprises of 6 district centres and 18 local centres as well as 
numerous neighbourhood centres and stand -alone shops.  The provisi on of 
easily accessible shops and services such as convenience stores, 
pharmacies and post offices, play an important role in meeting the day -to-day 
shopping needs of residents. The district and local centres are monitored bi-
annually to understand how the y change year -on-year and to ensure 
evidence indicates that they are still fit for purpose and meet the day -to-day 
shopping and service needs of local communities.  
 
10.21   Applications for town centre uses are required to follow a sequential approach 
whereas sites outside of the town centre boundary, where the floorspace 
proposed exceeds 1,000sq.m. (the Council’s locally set threshold) must 
undertake an Impact Assessment81. This policy identifies the hierarchy, and 
in so doing, assists in carrying out any Sequential and Impact Assessments 
by identifying the locations of centres and appropriate uses within them.  
 
10.22   The National Design Guide defines walkable local facilities as “local facilities 
[that] are within walking distance, generally considered to be no more than a 
10-minute walk (800m radius)”82. The NPPF (paragraph 134) states that 
“development that is not well designed should be refused, especially where it 
fails to reflect local design policies and Government guidance on design”83. 
This threshold has been applied to the policy in respect of accessing local 
centres. In relation to district centres, it is considered acceptable to drive to 
these, and an 8 -minute drive t ime has been applied84. 
 
10.23  The boundaries of the district and local centres are set out in Appendix G and 
Appendix H.

 11.0  Healthy, safe and inclusive 
communities  
 
11.1  The following policies set out the requirements that contribute to creating 
healthy, safe and inclusive communities.  
 
Policy HS1 – Ensuring the delivery of infrastructure  
 
 
Development will be required to provide infrastructure appropri ate to the scale and 
context of the site in order to mitigate any impacts of the development, and address 
the needs associated with the development. It may be related to social, economic 
and/or environmental provision. Supplementary Planning Guidance and d ocuments 
will be used to guide provision where relevant. Where this provision is considered 
unviable, the applicant should provide clear evidence to demonstrate this.  
 
Development needs to consider the cumulative impacts to existing infrastructure and 
for any potential large scale transport facilities required for the wider economy 
(including adequate overnight lorry parking).  
 
New infrastructure must be resilient to climate change and demonstrate how 
development considers carbon neutral emissions by 2050.  New infrastructure must 
promote public safety and the wider security and defence requirements.  
 
Developers should get in contact with utilities, including Severn Trent Water, as early 
as possible in the planning process, to ensure infrastructure can be p rovided in a 
timely manner.  
 
Infrastructure delivery should be suitably phased within the associated development, 
and where appropriate, arrangements should be made for subsequent maintenance. 
Applications which provide new facilities will be supported , subject to agreement 
with appro priate service delivery partners.  
 
All developments must consider the impact on provision of services and facilities 
and where there is an impact this must be addressed. The delivery of infrastructure 
provision and /or improvement will be secured through th e use of planning 
obligations /agreements (e.g.  Section 106, Section 278 and any future adopted 
mechanisms) and /or conditions. All development will be expected to contribute 
proportionately and in compliance with national policy, statute and relevant SPDs  
and guidance to infrastructure provision.   
 
The Council’s IDP identifies the key infrastructure requirements associated with the 
Borough Plan, and planning proposals should have regard to this.  
 
 
11.2 Ensuring infrastructure provision keeps pace with new development is a key 
component of delivering the Borough Plan Review. It is important that growth 
meets the needs of existing and future communities. Where possible, the  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
142 
 proposed growth seeks to take advantage of existing infrastructure provision. 
This is important because it will assist in ensuring that proposed developments 
are viable and as sustainable as they can be.  
 
11.3 New development will create pressures on existing infrastructure which will 
therefore need to be upgraded. The provision of new infrastructure will also be 
needed to bring development sites forward.  
 
11.4 Infrastructure provision also helps to mitigate any negative impacts the 
development may have on the Borough’s ability to provide services and facilities 
and include but are not restricted to:  
 
• Sustainability and ability to drive carbon neutrality.  
• Educati onal attainment.  
• Accessibility to services and jobs.  
• Health, social and cultural wellbeing of its communities.  
• Community safety and emergency services.  
• Heritage and the natural environment.  
• Biodiversity.  
• Flood risk mitigation.  
• Telecommunication and broadba nd provision.  
• Refuse and recycling facilities.  
 
11.5 This policy identifies generic infrastructure considerations. A number of other 
policies in the plan refer to specific infrastructure requirements and the delivery 
mechanisms used to deliver them, such as via planning obligations. The 
infrastructure requirements for each of the strategic sites are outlined in the site -
specific policies, although discussions with the infrastructure providers are 
ongoing. In the event that additional on -site infrastructure  is required, or 
planning obligations are required to go towards off -site infrastructure, these will 
be included in the updated IDP/Schedule.  
 
Borough Plan objectives  
 
11.6 This policy delivers the following Borough Plan objectives:  
 
• Strategic o bjective 5.  
• Strategic o bjective 6.  
• Strategic o bjective 8.  
 
Evidence base  
 
11.7 The evidence base related to this policy is as follows:  
 
• Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council (2021). Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan.  
 
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
143 
 Delivery mechanisms  
 
11.8 The delivery mechanisms for this policy are as follows:  
 
• Annual update of the IDP. 
• Use of planning obligations /agreements to bring in funds for infrastructure.  
• Continued co -ordination of the IDP Group.  
• Continued engagement with infrastructure service delivery partners and 
other partnership working, e.g.  membership of the A5 group.  
• Identification of infrastructure requirements for all sites  set out within the 
IDP. 
• Maintenance of infrastructure provided on -site or built /improved as part of 
the developmen t will be achieved through adoption by a public body, with 
appropriate maintenance payments or other secure arrangements.  
 
Monitoring  
 
11.9 The indicators and targets that will be monitored for this policy are outlined in 
Table 26. 
 
 Monitoring ref  Indicator  Target  
HS1a  Delivery of infrastructure 
set out within the IDP. Where infrastructure on 
sites is not being 
delivered in line with the 
IDP, this will trigger a 
review with appropriate 
service delivery partners.  
HS1b  Applications granted in 
line with advice of 
infrastructure service 
delivery partners.  Where applications are 
granted contrary to advice 
of infrastructure service 
delivery partners, it is 
expected that suitable 
planning justification is 
provided by the Council. 
Where advice from 
partners leads to 
mitigation, this is 
considered positive.  
HS1c  Monitoring of planning 
obligations /agreements 
that are:  
• Agreed  
• Implemented  
• Amended  Qualitative monitoring of 
this indicator will take 
place in the Authority 
Monitor ing Report. The 
purpose is to enable an 
understanding of how well 
the Council is performing 
in terms of the 
obligations /agreements.  
 
Table 26: Indicators and targets to be monitored for Policy HS1.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan

 Policy HS2 – Strategic accessibility and sustainable 
transport  
 
 
Transport proposals in line with those identified in the Coventry and Warwickshire 
Local Enterprise Partnership Strategic Economic Plan, Warwickshire County 
Council Local Transport Plan 2011 - 2026 (or subsequent u pdates), Warwickshire 
County Council Cycle Network Development Plan /Local Cycling and Walking 
Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP) and Bus Service Improvement Plan (BSIP) will be 
supported.   
 
The Strategic Transport Assessment (2023) modelling work assessed the pro vision 
of new dwellings or sq.m. of employment land as a maximum, whilst the policies 
refer to a minimum. Therefore, submissions for higher quantums will need to be 
assessed as part of any Transport Assessment submitted, to support a planning 
application, and additional infrastructure may be identified as necessary. 
Furthermore, new development should be integrated effectively with existing 
businesses and community facilities.  
 
Where a development is likely to have transport implications, planning applications 
are required to clearly demonstrate how the following issues will be  addressed:  
 
1. How the development ensures adequate accessibility in relation to all 
principal modes of transport to drive carbon neutrality and resilience to 
climate change.  
2. Whether the development identifies suitable demand management 
measures.  
3. How the proposal accords with  the Council’s adopted Transport Demand 
Management Matters (2022) and Air Quality (2 020) SPDs.  Development 
must consider the cumulative impact on air quality and measures proposed 
to ensure impact is not exacerbated , sustaining and contributing towards 
compliance with relevant limit values or natural objectives for pollutants, 
taking into  account the presence of AQMAs  and Clean Air Zones . The 
Council will require measures for new development to provide infrastructure 
to deal with the issues of air quality, which at its minimum, development will 
need to provide electric vehicle charging poi nts and dust management plans.  
4. The connectivity of the development to strategic facilities.  
5. How the development maximises sustainable transport options such as safe 
walking and cycling links to the wider transport network. Development needs 
to include the provision of secure cycle parking, easier access to rental 
bikes, e -bike hubs, lockers and showers in new workplace developments 
and appropriate shelter or cooling along the walking and cycling links.  
6. Whether the proposal will meet acceptable levels of im pact on existing 
highways networks and the mitigation measures required to meet this 
acceptable level.  
7. Transport elements need to reflect the National Design Guide, the National 
Model Design Code and Warwickshire Design Guide86.

 8. Development will need to be  designed to provide safe and suitable access 
for all users.  
 
Proposals for dedicated lorry parking facilities will be supported where they form 
extensions to , or are adjoining , existing employment land comprising of 
predominantly B8 uses or as part of a new predominantly B8 use development.  
 
Proposals should target a minimum 15% modal shift to non  car-based uses by 
including provisions which promote more sustainable transport options.  
 
The Council supports the provision and integration of emerging and fu ture 
intelligent mobility infrastructure that will help to deal with the issue of air quality.  
 
The Council will work proactively with Warwickshire County Council and Midlands 
Connect in order to support a new sustainable train station and parkway within the 
Nuneaton area.  
 
 
11.10  Nuneaton and Bedworth are subject to high levels of congestion, particularly 
during peak times. This includes the A5, which forms part of the strategic road 
network, and is an important corridor of movement and growth to the north and 
east of the Borough.  Accessibility to some industrial estates without a car (such 
as Bermuda) can also be difficult. Improvements to increase the use of 
sustainable transport modes are therefore important for economic growth, as 
well as for social and environmental reasons. T his is supported by aspirations 
at a national and sub -regional level.  
 
11.11  Proposals outlined in the Warwickshire Local Transport Plan 2011 - 2026 and 
the Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership Strategic 
Economic Plan have been incorporat ed into the IDP. 
 
11.12  The West Midlands Metropolitan Transport Emissions Framework and its 
associated policies, set out transport’s role in tackling air quality issues for the 
wider region, which in combination with the policies in the Borough Plan, will  
further help air quality.  
 
11.13  The Council is part of the A5 Transport Partnership Group regarding strategic 
objectives for the A5 corridor. This group comprises of officers representing 
Councils along the route of the A5 between Gailey, Staffordshire a nd Weedon, 
Northamptonshire.  
 
11.14  The Council also works with the Getting West Nuneaton Moving: Bermuda 
Connection scheme, which is focused on tackling congestion in and around 
west Nuneaton by creating a direct link between west Nuneaton and the Griff 
roundabout87. 
 
11.15  Warwickshire County Council is responsible for planning improvements to the 
strategic cycle network across Warwickshire. The Warwickshire, Coventry and

 Solihull Sub -Regional Green Infrastructure Study and Open Space Strategy 
2011 - 2021 identify further po tential green links that should be pursued through 
the Borough Plan. This is considered in more detail in ‘Policy NE1 - Green 
infrastructure’.  
 
11.16  The Strategic Transport Assessment  (2023)  highlighted the transport 
implications of bringing forward the s trategic allocations.  The 20 23 Strategic 
Transport Assessment  identified that the strategic site allocations should adopt 
a 15% modal shift target88. Without the 15% modal shift the transport network 
was considered unlikely to operate to a satisfactory le vel89.  
 
11.17  The 2023  updated Strategic Transport Assessment supports the Borough Plan 
Review and identifies potential impacts of allocations and proposals on the 
highway network, having regard to the latest available transport modelling. The 
assessment will also recommend the infrastructure required to make the 
developments acceptable in planning terms.   
 
11.18  An updated Air Quali ty Assessment for the Borough Plan Review has been 
prepared to assess the impacts of the proposed allocations on air quality. The 
assessment found that overall, the air quality effects of the emerging Borough 
Plan will not be significant.  
 
11.19  A propos al for a new train station between Nuneaton and Hinckley came about  
from a study into direct Coventry to Leicester services that might not call at 
Nuneaton station (the business case for Coventry to Leicester direct services 
currently include options whic h either serve or bypass the town’s station). Not 
only would the new station enable access to the new service, but it would also 
provide a more accessible station for those living on the eastern side of 
Nuneaton and potentially support major housing develo pment plans in the 
surrounding area. Depending on the site, it could also provide a ‘Parkway’ 
function with good access to the A5. This would reduce the number of cars 
currently accessing Nuneaton and Hinckley stations on local roads and 
intercept longer -distance journeys on the strategic road network.  
 
Planning applications  
 
11.20  Paragraphs 112 and 11390 of the NPPF  set out requirements, at the planning 
application stage, for all proposals that will generate significant amounts of 
movement. This includes the requirement for a Transport Statement /Transport 
Assessment, as well as a travel plan document.  
 
11.21  Planning applications will also be required to demonstrate how the proposals 
address the issues outlined in the policy. In relation to issue 1, the proposal 
should make best use of existing transport networks; for issue 2, demand 
management measures should  include adequate car parking; and in  relation to

 issue 4, some examples of key strategic facilities should be included, for 
example, local shopping, education and health facilities.  
 
11.22  The NPPF refers to local areas setting car parking standards. Des igns should 
adhere to the  Council’s  Transport Demand Management Matters SPD (2022) 
and Warwickshire Design Guide.  
 
11.23  The NPPF supports the provision of lorry parking facilities taking into account 
any local shortages and  the need to reduce the risk of parking in locations that 
lack proper facilities or results in adverse impacts on amenity. New or expanded 
distribution centres should make provision for sufficient lorry parking to cater for 
their anticipated use.

Table 27: Indicators and targets to be monitored for Policy HS2.  
 
Policy HS3 – Telecommunications and broadband 
connectivity  
 
 
Broadband  
 
All new major development, both residential and non -residential, will  be required to 
facilitate and contribute to the provision of superfast broadband infrastructure in 
order to enable the delivery of broadband services across the  Borough, giving 
particular attention to the inclusion of Fibre to the Premises ( FTTP ). Connections 
within developments must be easily accessible for repairs and upgrades. If a 
developer is of the view that this would be impractical or unviable, an independent 
Viability Assessment should be submitted with the application.  
 
Telecommunications proposals  
 
When considering telecommunications proposals, the Council will have reg ard for 
the operational requirements of the telecommunications networks and the technical 
limitations of the technology, including any technical constraints on the location of 
telecommunications apparatus.  
 
Proposals for telecommunications development will  be permitted provided that the 
following criteria are met:  
 
1. The siting and appearance of the proposed apparatus and associated 
structures must seek to minimise impact on the visual amenity, character or 
appearance of the surrounding area.  
2. The colour, sha de and finish of the paint /coating, to be applied to the mast 
and cabinet, should be chosen carefully, with consideration to the 
surrounding landscape.  
3. Methods to disguise telecommunications proposals and enhance their 
design, should be sufficiently explored.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
150 
 4. Where possible the proposed apparatus and associated structures should be 
sited on a building and designed in order to minimise impact to the exter nal 
appearance of the host building. Where siting is not possible on a building, 
the supporting evidence should indicate why this is unviable or unfeasible.  
5. If proposing a new mast, evidence must be provided that demonstrates that 
mast or site sharing is n ot feasible, and the possibility of erecting apparatus 
on existing buildings or other appropriate structures has been explored.  
6. If proposing development in a sensitive area, the development should not 
have an unacceptable effect on areas of ecological int erest, areas of 
landscape importance, archaeological sites, conservation areas or buildings 
of architectural or historic interest.  
7. Full details of all new landscaping, screening and the retention of any trees 
or vegetation on the site should be provided.  
8. Proposals must include details of a satisfactory scheme to return the site to 
its former or improved condition once operations have ceased and any 
apparatus is no longer required. If considered appropriate by the Council, the 
applicant may be requested for  a bond to be provided , under a planning 
obligation , to cover the cost of decommissioning and /or restoration of the site.  
9. Proposals should adhere to Government advice on the health effects of radio 
waves and consider the effects of the proposal on the amen ity of local 
residents.  
 
 
11.28 Telecommunications is defined as the infrastructure needed to provide fixed 
and mobile telephone, broadband and digital services. For information, the 
Code of Practice for Wireless Network Development in England91 should be 
used to assist Mobile Network Operators and wireless infrastructure providers 
in creating policy compliant telecommunications proposals. The document 
provides information on general siting and design principles, planning 
considerations and natur al environment and heritage assets for example.  
 
11.29 Mobile communications are now considered an integral part of the success of 
most business operations and individual lifestyles. With the growth of services 
such as mobile internet access, demand for ne w telecommunications 
infrastructure is continuing to grow. The Council is keen to facilitate appropriate 
expansion whilst at the same time minimising any environmental impacts. It is 
our policy to reduce the proliferation of new masts by encouraging mast s haring, 
as well as siting equipment on existing tall structures and buildings.  
 
11.30 Paragraphs 115, 116 and 11792 of the NPPF  contain detailed planning 
application requirements associated with communications infrastructure. It is 
expected that all planni ng applications will consider the requirements of the 
NPPF, as well as those within this policy.  
 
11.31 The decommissioning of telecommunications apparatus is often an 
afterthought , but it is critical that this apparatus is taken down responsibly. 
Conditi ons will be applied to planning consents for telecommunications

 development, requiring that the land be restored when the operation of the 
telecommunications apparatus has expired. Full restoration may require the 
removal of all apparatus and ancillary str uctures, as well as restoration of 
appropriate vegetation, depending on the nature of the site.  
 
Broadband connectivity  
 
11.32 The Coventry, Solihull and Warwickshire (CSW) broadband project, of which 
the Council is a member, is funded by Central Government and local authority 
money, and aims to achieve 98% coverage at superfast broadband speeds 
across the area, in line with Government and European connectivity targets93. 
 
11.33 The CSW broadband project is advocating for new development to install  FTTP  
technology to future proof the delivery of broadband. FTTP technology can be 
more costly and disruptive to retrofit, particularly in new developments where 
newly laid roads would have to be taken up upon completion of the whole site. 
The fitting of F TTP technology is therefore most effective when implemented 
on new developments during the initial construction phase, alongside wider 
utilities provision or highways construction.  
 
11.34 In February 2016 an agreement was made between BT and the National 
Housebuilders Federation where BT will provide on -site infrastructure free of 
charge and will in some circumstances subsidise access to the fibre spine, 
which provides superfast broadband. Consequently, the cost to developers 
would be minimal on a pence per  metre basis. FTTP technology also allows the 
end user to choose their internet service provider, bringing cost savings to the 
public through effective competition.

Table 28: Indicator and target to be monitored for Policy HS3.  
 
 
Policy HS4 – Retaining and expanding community 
facilities  
 
 
Proposals for development which would lead to the loss of community facilities will 
only be permitted where:  
 
• adequate alternative facilitie s and services are available locally; or  
• access to locally alternative  facilities are enhanced; or  
• better replacement facilities are proposed nearby; or  
• it can be clearly demonstrated that there is no longer a demand or is surplus 
to requirements for the use . Alternatively, the use is no longer 
viable /appropriate and that there is a greater benefit to the area resulting from 
the proposed use.  
 
New development serving a loca l community or business need (especially in rural 
areas or where not served by public transport) will be encouraged unless material 
considerations indicate otherwise.  
 
 
11.39 This policy seeks to ensure existing facilities are not detrimentally impacted 
upon as part of any development proposal. The provision of new facilities will 
primarily be delivered through the IDP and ‘Policy HS1 – Ensuring delivery of 
infrastructure provision’.  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
153 
 11.40 Community facilities have an important role within the local community, 
contributing towards community cohesion, health and wellbeing, delivering 
sport and physical activity, as well as the sustainability of the local area. The 
loss of existing community f acilities will be resisted to ensure that suitable 
provision remains spread across the Borough. Examples of community facilities 
are listed below (however, it should be noted that this list is not exhaustive):  
 
• Sports centres and multi -use halls.  
• Allotments.  
• Public houses.  
• Health facilities.  
• Places of worship.  
• Cultural facilities.  
• Schools.  
• Open space.  
• Green spaces /parks.  
• Indoor sports and recreational buildings and land . 
• Sports and playing fields.  
• Play areas.  
• Community centres.  
• Local shops.  
 
11.41 There is already some protection afforded to community facilities if they are 
designated as an asset of community value94. Further information on assets of 
community value can be found on the Council’s website95.

Table 29: Indicator and target to be monitored for Policy HS4.  
 
Policy HS5 – Health  
 
 
All major development proposals will be required to demonstrate that they would 
have an acceptable impact on health and wellbeing. This should be demonstrated 
through a:  
 
• Health Impact Assessment Screening Report which demonstrates that the 
proposed development would not overall give rise to negative impacts in 
respect of health and wellbeing; or  
• Health Impact Assessment where significant impacts on health and wellbeing 
would arise from that proposal.  
 
All Health Impact Assessments shall be undertaken in accordance with the Council’s 
adopted Health Impact Assessment SPD (2021).  
 
Where a development has significant negative or positive impac ts on health and 
wellbeing, the Council may require applicants to provide for the mitigation or 
provision of such impacts through planning conditions and /or financial /other 
contributions secured via planning obligations.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
155 
 11.46 Health and well being are key issues at the national and local level. Alcohol 
abuse, obesity96, mental health, dementia and cardiovascular disease97 are all 
health  concerns for the Borough. Nuneaton and Bedworth ranked the lowest of 
the districts and Boroughs in Warwickshire for ov erall vulnerability to the rising 
cost of living. The Borough was lower on the poverty -based vulnerability rank 
than the work -based vulnerability rank, meaning that there is a higher relative 
risk of those who are already struggling being pushed into desti tution relating 
to fuel poverty, food insecurity and child poverty98. Health is not simply about 
access to medical facilities; it is also about lifestyle and the ability to make 
healthier choices that are not restricted by cost. Physical activity can also play 
an important part of health and wellbeing. This element is dealt with through 
’Policy HS6 – Sport and exercise’. This policy focuses on elements of health 
that are not picked up elsewhere in the plan. 
 
11.47 Applications requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment are likely to impact 
health.  Planning applications not requiring an Environmental Impact 
Assessment are still likely to create impacts on health. However, identifying an 
appropriate scale of application is challenging. Ultim ately the impact is likely to 
vary even for applications of similar use classes. Consequently, the policy 
recommends a screening process be undertaken by the applicant to assist in 
determining the need for a Health Impact Assessment . 
 
11.48 The Council’s SPD assists in determining how a Health Impact Assessment 
should be undertaken, as well as the criteria that should be included as part of 
any assessment. Warwickshire Public Health recommends the use of either the 
London Healthy Urban Development Unit (HUD U) Health Impact Assessment  
tool99, or the Wales Health Impact Assessment Support Unit (WHIASU) tool100. 
The submitted Health Impact Assessment will be assessed by Warwickshire 
Public Health during the determination period. Warwickshire Public Health’s 
preferred approach is to use the tools outlined within this document (HUDU and 
WHIASU). In light of the recommendations from Warwickshire Public Health, 
the Council has adapted an assessment matrix from the HUDU. Applicants 
should use this Development Health Assessment (Appendix B  of the Health 
Impact Assessment SPD (2021) ) as a Health Impact Assessment  Screening 
Report and it should be submitted with planning applications for major 
development . 
 
11.49  The Development Health Assessment is designed to be used early in the 
planning process to aid decision -making in relation to impacts on hea lth. It 
provides an overview of some of the broad determinants of health and wellbeing 
and it provides a means of recording the consideration given to impacts on 
health.  The intention is that it complements the other policies in the Borough 
Plan that can impact on the wider determinants of healt h.

 Policy HS6 – Sport  and exercise  
 
 
Proposals which assist in creating a healthier environment across the Borough, 
using sports, leisure and recreational facilities and /or opportunities to exercise, will 
be supported .  
 
Existing local sports pitches  and playing fields  should be retained unless justification 
can be provided as to why they are no longer required or that proves alternative 
suitable provisions can be provided.  
 
New developments including strategic housing sites, will be required to plan from 
the outset for  the integrated planning of a healthy environment for its communities. 
This includes the provision and maintenance for sport, physical activity and 
community facilities, as well as green infrastructure, open space, allotments  and 
walking and cycling routes  in line with policies NE1 – Green infrastructure and NE2 
– Open space. New facilities, links and spaces should relate well to other areas, and 
be safe, convenient, accessible and functional. Spaces should be resilient to and 
mitigate for climate change a nd include natural planting to provide shaded outdoor 
spaces and to help with air filtration.  
 
Where justified on -site, housing sites will need to provide the land for the facility at 
no cost, in a suitable location within the site. Where provision is just ified, but not on -
site, then an off -site contribution will be required to fund the facility and the land 
required for the facility. Where requirements stated in the Playing Pitch and Outdoor 
Sports Strategy cannot be met off -site, provisions may be require d on-site. 
 
In ensuring the timely delivery of infrastructure requirements, development 
proposals must demonstrate that full regard has been paid to the IDP all other 
policies and relevant strategies, including the Playing Pitch and Outdoor Sports 
Strategy ; Sport, Recreation and Community Facilities Strategy; Open Space 
Strategy; Green Infrastructure Strategy; Indoor Leisure Facilities Needs Strategy 
and Allotment Strategy, or documents that formally superseded them. The o n-site 
provision, maintenance and m anagement of sports and recreation facilities 
provided, will be secured through planning obligation, as they will be needed to make 
the development acceptable in planning terms.  
 
The scale, design and specification of facilities sought will be calculated a nd 
provided based on provision standards, facility specifications and needs, and costs 
as set out in relevant strategies. Additionally, the facilities will need to meet the 
Regulation 122 Tests set out in The Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 
2010  or subsequent amendments.  
 
 
11.54 Developers will be expected to collaborate on the provision of infrastructure 
which is needed to serve more than one site.  
 
11.55 The sport, physical activity and healthy communities’ policies directly relate to 
the NPPF  paragraphs 92, 93 and 98; noting that to deliver the social,  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
158 
 recreational and cultural facilities and services the community needs, planning 
policies and decisions shoul d:  
• plan positively for the provision and use of shared spaces, community 
facilities (such as sports venues to enhance the sustainability of 
communities), and residential environments, and  
• ensure an integrated approach to considering the loc ation of housing, 
economic uses and community facilities and services.  
 
11.56 The Council has undertaken studies to identify specific needs and quantitative 
or qualitative deficits or surpluses of open space, sports and recreational 
facilities in the local  area. Information gained from the assessments should be 
used to determine what open space, sports and recreational provision is 
required, and to set strategic priorities for the area.  
 
11.57 Paragraph 99 of the NPPF contains detailed planning application requirements 
associated with open space  and sports , recreational buildings and land, 
including playing field losses . These are identified below:  
 
• Existing open space, sports and recreational buildings and land, including 
playing fields, should not be built on unless:  
o an assessment has been undertaken which has clearly shown the open 
space, buildings or land to be surplus to requirements; or  
o the loss resulting from the proposed development would be replaced 
by equivalent or better provision in terms of quantity and quality in a 
suitable location; or  
o the development is for alternative sports and recreational provision, the 
benefits of which clearly outweigh the loss of the current or former use.  
 
11.58 The policy does not repeat these requirement s; however, it is expected that 
applications take account of this policy and the wider NPPF requirements. In 
any case, approval and sign off from Sports England will be required.  
 
Maintenance  
 
11.59 Where there is provision of new on -site sports and recrea tion facilities these will 
also require contributions for maintenance. This also applies to open space, 
green infrastructure, playing fields and allotments. Open space and other green 
infrastructure will be funded for 20 years. Developments which have faci lities 
that can reasonably be expected to fund their own maintenance will not pay for 
the maintenance of these facilities. This includes facilities within leisure /sports 
centres (swimming pools, sports halls, gyms, studios), artificial grass pitches, 
tennis courts, facilities in community halls and cycle tracks. The current sports 
facilities priorities are listed in the IDP. If future facilities do require maintenan ce, 
contributions for these will be funded for 20 years.    
 
11.60 The requirement for the maintenance of on -site facilities will be based on the 
whole strategic housing site area, so the co -operation of 
landowners /developers /house builders is required to ensure this cost is met 
fairly.

Outside  of the defined town, district and local centres, hot  food takeaways will only 
be supported  where:  
 
• It is demonstrated that the proposal will not have a significant adverse impact 
on residential amenity through odour, noise and litter.  
• Deliveries or custom er visits by car would not have an unacceptable impact 
on existing or proposed public transport provision, traffic movements, road 
or pedestrian safety.  
• The proposal is not within a 400m radius, of the boundary, of an existing 
primary or secondary school ( including any special school, sixth form college 
or academy). This will not apply when the buffer zone overlaps with a town 
or local centre.  
• The proposal does not jeopardise the provision of an essential local service.  
• A Sequential Assessment is provided,  which demonstrates that there are no 
other sequentially preferable sites.  
 
Proposals should be in accordance with the Council’s adopted Planning for a

Support will be given for opportunities to tackle obesity through other  means , or a ny 
further SPDs  as evidence or initiatives evolve.  
 
 
11.65 A Health Impact Assessment was undertaken to inform the adopted Borough 
Plan and recommended the inclusion of a restrictive policy regarding fast -food 
outlets. There is evidence to suggest obesity levels may be higher in areas of 
high numbers of fast -food outlets. The Council aims to contribute to creating 
healthy environments where possible and has therefore introduced criteria 
which must be adhered to for any f uture fast-food proposals both within and 
outside of town centres.  
 
11.66 Implementing a 400m fast -food buffer around primary and secondary schools 
has proven to be a successful measure for other local authorities.  A 400m buffer 
is chosen as this is though t to equate to a five -minute walking time.

 12.0  Natural environment  
 
12.1 The following policies focus on protecting, conserving and enhancing the 
natural environment.  
 
Policy NE1 – Green and blue infrastructure  
 
 
The Borough’s green and blue infrastructure assets will be protected, managed, 
enhanced or created to provide natur e recovery networks. New development 
proposals will enhance, sustain and restore existing and create green (including 
wildbelts) and blue infrastructure (including canals); whilst at the same time 
protecting and enhancing public rights of way.  
 
Climate ch ange will be fundamental to new development and green and blue 
infrastructure must play a part in delivering long -term mitigation and adaptation to 
this, including installation of retro -fit SuDS such as rain gardens, bio -retention and 
tree pits . 
 
Developme nt should comply with the Council’s adopted Open Space and Green 
Infrastructure  SPD (2021 ) and any emerging studies.   
 
The historic environment should be valued as an important asset in contributing to 
the multi -functionality of green -blue infrastructure via cultural heritage, recreation 
and tourism, utilising assets such as historic parks, gardens and canals.  
 
Where development proposals have a watercourse classified as a main river within 
their boundary, as a minimum, developers should set back developme nt 8m from 
the top of the bank or landward toe of any flood defence. The same easement will 
also be required on smaller watercourses to maintain water elements, ecology and 
wildlife corridors. Greater widths are appropriate where forming green infrastructu re, 
open space or ecological corridors such as 50m buffers for ancient woodland, 30 m 
buffers around all semi -natural woodland and broad -leaved plantation woodland and 
5m buffers either side of intact hedgerows.  
 
 
12.2 Green and blue infrastructure is the living network of green spaces, water and 
other environmental features in both urban and rural areas. The Green 
Infrastructure Plan identifies the range of such features in the Borough as 
follows:  
 
• Green links – right o f ways, long distance paths, national cycle routes and 
river and canal network s. 
• Amenity green space – village greens, playing fields and sports pitches.  
• Parks and gardens – open space hierarchy of local, community and 
destination parks, cemeteries and churchyards, and allotments.  
• Natural and semi -natural green spaces – local and designated wildlife sites, 
local nature reserves, woodlands, quarries, disused railway lines, 
floodplains and productive farmland.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
164 
 • Cultural heritage – historic pa rks and gardens, scheduled monuments and 
historic landscapes.  
 
12.3 There are multiple benefits of green infrastructure to residents, wildlife and the 
economy, for example in terms of health and wellbeing, connecting wildlife 
habitats, flood protection, ca rbon storage and presenting an attractive location 
are recognised at both national and local levels.  
 
12.4 The NPPF  points to a strategic need to plan positively to create, protect, 
enhance and manage networks of biodiversity and green infrastructure.  
 
12.5 The Sub -Regional Green Infrastructure Strategy collates evidence about green 
infrastructure for Warwickshire, Cov entry and Solihull101. It focuses on 
landscape, biodiversity and accessibility to natural green space. The strategy’s 
main messages are to identify for the sub -region:  
 
• The main strategic areas of opportunity for strengthening landscape 
character.  
• Biodiver sity assets and strategic areas for reconnecting habitats.  
• Accessibility assets and deficiencies using Natural England’s Accessible 
Natural Greenspace Standard and the Woodland Access Standards.  
 
12.6 The Green Infrastructure Plan looks at the benefits an d interlinkages of the 
multi -functions of green infrastructure for the Borough. It analyses the functions , 
accessible green space, biodiversity, landscape character and distinctiveness, 
water quality, flooding, climate change, food, fuel, cultural heritage , health and 
wellbeing, and sustainable active travel. From this analysis, the Green 
Infrastructure Plan identifies key messages and landscape zones as a 
framework for projects for the long -term planning of the Borough’s green 
infrastructure especially in relation to climate change and nature recovery. The 
following landscape zones are identified:  
 
• Forest of Arden landscape enhancement.  
• Post-industrial and geological heritage.  
• Urban waterways and wetlands.  
• Urban greening.  
• Strategic and local greenways and corridors.  
 
12.7 Warwickshire County Council is developing strategic cycle network plans for 
Nuneaton and Bedworth and for Nuneaton to Coventry. These will be an 
important consideration in terms of delivering a linked net work of signed 
strategic and local greenway routes for walking and cycling.  
 
Blue infrastructure  
 
12.8 The water component of green infrastructure is often referred to as blue 
infrastructure, and the two can often be interlinked to provide additional 
 
101 Warwickshire Museum and Natural Environment (2013). Warwickshire, Coventry and Solihull Sub -
Regional Green Infrastructure Strategy.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
165 
 benefits. Green spaces can be used to reduce flood risk by managing flood 
flows and creating flood storage a reas.  They can also be used to improve 
accessibility to watercourses, support regeneration and improve opportunities 
for leisure, economic activity and biodiversity. In addition, river corridors 
identified as functional floodplains should be protected, as they provide 
opportunities for the linkage of green infrastructure, can provide storage during 
a flood event and can also provide specialist habitat areas.  
 
12.9 Where development proposals include a watercourse within their site boundary, 
providing an eas ement between the development edge and the watercourse 
can help contribute to the delivery of green corridors. An 8m easement is 
typically used and should be included in proposals wherever possible.  
 
12.10  Blue infrastructure also includes SuDS. ‘Policy NE 4 – Managing flood risk and 
water quality’ states that SuDS must be incorporated within all development in 
order to reduce surface water run -off, as well as provide biodiversity and water 
quality benefits.

Policy NE2 – Open space  and playing fields  
 
 
New development must demonstrate  how it will improve the  green network of 
publicly accessible and linked open spaces to support growth by:  
 
1. Protecting and enhancing the hierarchy of open spaces which are made up 
of destination parks, community parks and local parks. This includes:  
a. Improving open spaces at Change Brook Close, Buttermere Recreation 
Ground, St Giles, Blackberry Lane and Anderton  Road in order to 
create community parks.  
b. Providing new community parks at Whitestone, The Long Shoot and 
Bulkington.  
2. Creating new open spaces and links for the strategic housing sites.  
3. Improving access to nature where there is a deficit of space.  
4. Addressi ng open space through new provision or improving existing provision 
in line with standards set out in the Open Space Strategy.  
5. Providing new allotments or improving existing allotments in order to enable 
communities to grow food where deficiencies exist, i n line with standards set 
out in the Allotment Strategy.  
6. Providing new or improving existing children’s play facilities and facilities for 
young people in line with the standards in the Open Space Strategy  and any 
emerging studies.  
7. Providing new playing fi elds in line with the Playing Pitch and Outdoor Sports 
Strategy.  
8. Creating a network of strategic and local walking and cycling routes in order 
to increase the connectivity of open spaces.   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
167 
 9. Providing  areas of tree planting of a mix of predominantly native tr ees, street 
trees of appropriate species and where appropriate community orchards.  
 
Climate change will be fundamental to new development, including open spaces 
which must play a part in delivering long -term mitigation and adaptation.  
 
New open space can  be used multi -functionally as flood storage except for formal 
children’s play areas or sports pitches.  
 
 
12.15  The NPPF  recognises that access to high quality open spaces for sport and 
recreation can make an important contribution to the health and wellbeing of 
communities.  Landscaping within o pen spaces can also make a valuable 
contribution to help reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and to build 
resilience and adaptation for climate change.  
 
12.16  The NPPF also sets out criteria for the loss of existing open space, sports and 
recreational buildings and land, including playing fields. ‘Policy HS4 – Retaining 
community facilities’, sets out the local approach to the loss of such facilities. 
Where losses are proposed, the Council will consider the criteria in the NPPF 
as well as relevant standards and assessments set out in the Open Space 
Strategy102 and Playing Pitch and Outdoor Sports Strategy103 (or as per any 
subsequent updates)  in terms of using ‘Policy HS4 – Retaining community 
facilities ’. 
 
12.17  The Open Space Strategy defines a typology and hierarchy of sites and 
standards for the quantity, quality  and accessibility of open space. The strategy 
identifies the areas where there is a surplus or deficit of open space in terms of 
quantity, quality and accessibility, as well as those open spaces to be given 
priority for improvement and investment in order  to meet access and quality 
standards. The overall aim is to create a publicly accessible green network of 
open spaces.  
 
12.18  A key element of the Open Space Strategy is to ensure that all properties in the 
Borough have access to a community park. This means that all residents will 
be within 600 m or 10 -12 minutes walking distance of a community park. To 
achieve this aim, current deficiencies will be addressed by:  
 
• Improving open spaces to create community parks at Change Brook Close, 
Buttermere Recreation Ground, St Giles, Blackberry Lane and Anderton 
Road.  
• Providing new community parks  in Whitestone, The Long Shoot and 
Bulkington.  
• Providing new community parks and /or improving existing community parks 
in order to meet the needs of res idents of the strategic housing sites.

 12.19  Proposed community parks will be removed from Green Belt as part of the 
related development proposals.  
 
12.20  In terms of access to nature, when considering development proposals, the 
Council will take account of the standards proposed by Natural England, the 
Accessible Natural Greenspace Standard and the Woodland Trust’s Woodland 
Access Standard.  
 
12.21  The Open Space Strategy recognises the need for children and young people 
to have access to play provision and teenage facilities to meet their needs.  
 
12.22  The Allotment Strategy identifies areas where there are deficiencies of 
allotments and quantity, quality and accessibility standards104. New allotments 
will be provided in line with the standards in the Allotment Strategy.

Table 34: Indicator and target to be monitored for Policy NE2.  
 
 
Policy NE3 – Biodiversity and geodiversity  
 
 
The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, protected species, the 
Government ’s 25 Year Plan and Environment Act 2021105 are all key national 
legislation that must be adhered to. Development proposals need to ensure 
ecological networks, services and biodiversity and geological features are 
conserved, enhanced, restored and created to assist in nature recovery. The use of 
mechanisms to improve biodiversity such as green roofs or green walls are 
encouraged.  
 
Ecological network  
 
Sites on international, national and local levels (including existing and potential local 
wildlife sites) will be protected from development. The level of protection sought for 
the site will be at an appropriate scale to the site’s designation status, and the 
contribution it makes to the ecological network.  
 
Fragmentation of habitats  
 
Development proposals will ensure species are able to positively respond and adapt 
to the impacts of climate change by preventing the fragmentation of existing 
habitats. Link s and habitats should be created where there are gaps to the 
ecological network of wildlife sites, wildbelts, stepping  stones, wildlife and canal 
corridors, and green spaces, regardless of whether they are of international, national 
or local importance. Wa tercourses should be joined up to provide natural linkages 
for ecological networks and to improve water quality.

Environment Act 2021 .    Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
170 
  
Biodiversity offsetting  
 
Biodiversity net gain offsetting will be required as a last resort once all available 
options in the mitigation hierarchy have been explored.  Developers must use 
Warwickshire County Council’s biodiversity offsetting metrics (until such time this is 
superseded by the mandatory use of the national metrics) to quantify the impact, 
and to calculate an appropriate level of compensation to replace the lost habitat. If 
the habitat loss cannot be replaced on site, the replacement habitat should be 
provided, in the Borough, in the follo wing order:  
 
• A biodiversity strategic location.  
• A location adjoining and /or linking a biodiversity strategic location.  
• A location which significantly increases connectivity between LBAP habitats 
– and/or any emerging Nature Recovery network location that a ligns with 
targeted areas and corridors for increased ecological connectivity.  
 
Geological diversity  
 
Development proposals will avoid adversely impacting sites of geological interest 
and, where appropriate, conserve and enhance such features for the enjoyment of 
residents, and for reasons of advancing local geological education.  
 
Ecological and geological  assessment  
 
Development proposals affecting the ecological network and  / or important 
geological features will be accompanied by a Preliminary Ecological Assessment 
and/or, where relevant, a Geological Assessment.   
 
Where the assessment indicates an adverse impact, the assessment must set out 
a mitigation strategy to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity, indicate how it will 
create biodiversity  net gains and where relevant, how it will reduce its geological 
impact.  
 
Any proposal that directly or indirectly impacts on a highly distinctive ecological site 
must show that less distinctive ecological sites have been considered first and 
explain why those sites were not suitable. The assessment must demonstrate that 
the benefits of the development proposal will outweigh the immediate loss of 
biodiversity and /or geodiversity before development is permitted. The assessment 
must also demonstrate that the  combination of proposed habitat retention, 
enhancement and any biodiversity offsetting, results in a minimum of a 10% net gain 
in biodiversity and where appropriate enhance ‘at risk habitats’ identified in the 
Biodiversity Action Plan, Green Infrastructur e Strategy and any emerging Nature 
Recovery Plans. The assessment should include retention, enhancement and 
creation of ecological habitats and nature recovery. Developments that create new 
habitat should seek to accommodate a mix of predominantly native t rees, including 
fruit trees as well as suitable species of street trees.  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
171 
 Where there is evidence of deliberate neglect , clearance or damage to biodiversity 
prior to the submission of an application, the Council will assess the acceptability 
and biodiversity calculations on what was considered to be the original condition.   
 
Special Areas of Conservation and Sites of Specia l Scientific Interest  
 
Development that would adversely affect Special Areas of Conservation or cause 
significant harm to SSSI  will not normally be granted planning permission.  
 
 
12.27  The NPPF  provides opportunities to help redress biodiversity losses from new 
development, as it promotes the concept of biodiversity net gains. The 
Environment Act 2021 takes this further and sets a legal requirement for 
planning permission to exceed the pre -devel opment biodiversity value of the 
onsite habitat by at least 10%.  
  
12.28  The NPPF states that Councils should plan positively to create, protect, 
enhance and manage recovery networks for biodiversity. It also states that 
distinctions should be made between  the hierarchy of international, national and 
locally designated sites so that protection is appropriate with their status and 
gives appropriate weight to their importance and the contribution that they make 
to the wider ecological networks.  
 
12.29  Sites w hich are awarded protection include:  
 
• International sites (such as Special Areas of Conservation).  
• National sites (such as SSSI).  
• The Warwickshire, Coventry and Solihull Biodiversity Action Plan Priority 
Habitats and Species.  
• Local nature reserves.  
• Local and potential wildlife sites and local geological sites . 
• Sites with a high distinctiveness score.  
 
12.30  The 2016 maps produced by the Habitat Biodiversity Audit Partnership for 
Warwickshire, Coventry and Solihull106 show habitat provision, connectivity and 
access to nature are particularly poor on the east side of the Borough, whilst to 
the west, provision is relatively good, but conn ectivity and access is also poor.  
Additionally, the Borough only has a small number of statutory protected wildlife 
and geological sites (one Special Area of Conservation, two SSSIs and three 
local nature reserves).  
 
12.31  A small element of the Borough’s ecological network consists of statutory 
designated sites, including Special Areas of Conservation, SSSIs and local 
nature reserves. One site, Ensor’s Pool, is currently designated all three.  The 
majority of the network is  made up of non -statutory local wildlife sites and 
potential local wildlife sites, as well as priority habitats and species, woodland 
and ancient woodland, rivers and canals, and green corridors and stepping

 stones. In line with this, coherent physically c onnected habitat corridors and 
networks, linking sites of higher ecological value , are now recognised as 
essential. Additionally, non -statutory sites contribute to the greater good of 
conserving biodiversity and geodiversity and are viewed as an integral 
component of the ecological network.  
 
12.32  To distinguish between habitats with greater ecological importance, both the 
Ecology and Geodiversity Assessment107 and Sub -Regional Green 
Infrastructure Strategy108 score habitats on their distinctiveness. High 
distinctiveness scores equate to areas of highest biodiversity, including all 
unimproved and semi -improved habitats. High distinctiveness will also 
incorporate statutory sites, local wildlife sites and the Biodiversity Action Plan 
habitats. The high distinct iveness category for linear habitats includes species -
rich hedgerows.  
 
12.33  The protection, enhancement and creation of ecological habitats has the 
opportunity to help ameliorate the effects of climate change through carbon 
capture. As such, habitats can serve dual purposes and opportunities should 
be taken to enhance not only biodiversity but the ability to capture carbon (but 
the latter not at the expense of the biodiversity of the land). Areas of increased 
biodiversity interest can also ameliorate the e ffects of overheating, from rising 
temperatures, through tree planting and by providing shade. Fruit trees should 
form part of this planting.  
 
Biodiversity offsetting  
 
12.34  The mitigation hierarchy should be applied where relevant, which follows the 
order of avoid, minimise, restore and offset.  
 
12.35  Biodiversity calculations will be required (except for householders) at the time 
of any planning application submission. Biod iversity offsetting metrics have 
been provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  and 
Natural England in order to calculate the value of biodiversity in monetary terms. 
Warwickshire County Council have modified the metrics to take ac count of local 
considerations and provide advice to developers in making their calculations109. 
Applying the metrics ensures that the losses resulting from development and 
the gains achieved through biodiversity offsetting, are measured in the same 
way. W arwickshire County Council’s biodiversity offsetting metric is to be used 
until such time that this is superseded by the mandatory use of the national 
metrics.

Policy NE4 – Managing flood risk and water quality  
 
 
Managing flood risk  
 
New development should be prioritised to areas of lowest flood risk and must not 
increase flood risk elsewhere. This should consider the risk from all sources 
including fluvial, surface water, groundwater and sewer flood risk, making use of the 
SFRAs  (both  Level 1 and Level 2)  (August  2023) , available public mapping such as 
the Flood Map for Planning and the Flood Risk from Surface Water map and historic 
flood information (which is available from the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) and 
other partners).  
 
Flood risk should be considered proportionately for all development. A site -specific 
Flood Risk Assessment will be required to support planning applications for major  
developments or those in areas at risk of flooding, in order to demonstrate that the 
risk both within the site and to surrounding /downstream sites is not increased. 
Submitted Flood Risk Assessments should refer to the recommendations of the 
latest SFRA : Level 2  (August  2023) , the Humber and Severn Flood Risk 
Management Plans and Warwickshire County Council’s Local Flood Risk 
Management Strategy. Notwithstanding the requirement for a Flood Risk 
Assessment for major developments  to be submitted, all developm ents will require 
a drainage strategy which demonstrates how surface water will be managed in 
accordance with the drainage hierarchy and flood risk will not be increased 
downstream.  
 
New development proposals must account for climate change in their plans  to 
ensure that the site will be safe over its lifetime. This should consider the potential 
for exceedance events, for example due to extreme events beyond design standards 
or through failure of assets, and how such overland flows are directed safely throu gh 
a development without exposing new or existing property to greater flood risk.  
 
A sequential approach to the layout of the development should be taken so that 
buildings and access routes are located in areas of lowest flood risk. Modification of 
ground levels /compensation works may be undertaken in order to reconfigure land  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
175 
 located within flood zone 3a. However,  modifications to increase land available for 
development is not permitted. With any changes in ground levels, detailed 
consideration should be g iven to exceedance /overland flow routes.  
 
For development located in areas at risk of flooding, mitigation measures should be 
provided up to the 1% annual probability plus climate change flood event. Safe 
access and egress must also be demonstrated. Finish ed floor levels in areas at risk 
of flooding should be set no lower than 600mm above the 1% annual probability plus 
climate change flood level.  
 
All new developments should contribute to creating space for water through use of 
blue and green infrastructur e, and where relevant, restoring functional floodplains 
(flood zone 3b). New developments should also seek opportunities for river 
restoration and enhancement, e.g. de -culverting, removing structures and 
reinstating a natural, sinuous river channel. As a m inimum all developments are 
required to provide an 8m wide undeveloped buffer strip from the watercourse (from 
the top of the bank or the centreline of the culvert) to allow access for routine 
maintenance and emergency clearance.  
 
In terms of the risks to traditional buildings from flooding, care must be taken not to 
introduce inappropriate retrofitted measures which would prevent effective drying 
and shorten the life of the building.  
 
Flood risk management schemes (flood defences)  
 
Proposals for new devel opments should not detrimentally impact upon existing and 
planned flood risk management schemes. New developments that will benefit from 
existing flood risk management schemes will be required to contribute towards their 
ongoing maintenance, in line with t he requirements of the IDP. 
 
Land that is required for current and future flood management will be safeguarded 
from development.  
 
SuDS  
 
New development will be required to implement appropriate, above -ground, SuDS 
techniques in order to manage surface water run -off. For all sites, surface water 
discharge rates should be no greater than QBar (or QMed) site -specific greenfield 
run-off rates,  unless otherwise agreed by the LLFA. Warwickshire County Council’s 
Flood Risk  Guidance for Develop ment110 should be referenced for drainage design 
and guidance on discharge rates.  
 
Surface water run -off should be managed as close to its source as possible  and 
discharged in line with the surface water drainage hierarchy. Opportunities to utilise 
rainwater harvesting or reuse should be explored , to have benefits for both flood risk 
and water scarcity. Discharge via any sewer network is considered the last re sort 
and where discharging into 3rd party assets (e.g. sewer network), written 
confirmation from the asset owner of the acceptance of such connection will be 
 
110 Warwickshire County Council  (2023). Flood Risk Guidance for Development .  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
176 
 required. All redevelopment of brownfield sites should seek to remove existing 
connections to the public sewer for surface water drainage.  
 
Developers are encouraged to contact Severn Trent, regarding sewer capacity, at 
an early stage of planning, to ensure adequate time is available to assess the risk 
and develop any network improvements should they be required.  
 
All development proposals and public realm improvements should consider the use 
of urban wetlands and street rain gardens as part of sustainable drainage schemes, 
particularly where there are known surface water flooding problems, or whe re wildlife 
habitat connectivity could be enhanced or restored.  
 
Above ground SuDS features must be included within all development in order to 
bring wider sustainability benefits including improved water quality, enhanced 
biodiversity and amenity /leisure value. SuDS should be dispersed across a 
development (e.g. not concentrated in a single attenuation feature) with 
consideration given to design for and retaining the first 5mm of rainfall.  
 
SuDS should be designed so that they do not impact on archaeology.  Impacts can 
be caused by draining waterlogged archaeology or introducing surplus water and 
pollution from surface runoff into archaeological sediments via soakaways . 
Consideration should be given to the most appropriate course of action to protect 
buried waterlogged archaeology through the design of SuDS features.  
 
Details of the SuDS proposed to be used, including operation and maintenance, 
must be agreed at the ea rliest possible stage with the LLFA.  
 
Water quality  
 
New developments must demonstrate that they will not result in adverse impacts on 
the quality of waterbodies, groundwater and surface water, will not prevent 
waterbodies and groundwater from achieving a  good status in the future and 
contribute positively to the environment and ecology, in and adjacent to the Borough.  
 
All attempts must be made to separate surface water and foul water, ensuring that 
surface water connections are not made to the foul /combi ned sewer network.  
 
The management and improvement of water quality should be considered hand -in-
hand with the provision of SuDS across a development. Proposals should be 
accompanied by a proportionate assessment (e.g. simple index approach) outlining 
the risks of a development proposal and how the proposed surface water drainage 
system will manage and mitigate those risks.  
 
Proposals will benefit the river network by restoring the functional floodplain and 
reinstating a natural meandering river channel whe re it has previously been lost. In 
doing so, development proposals should refer to the principles of the EU Water 
Framework Directive and the associated actions and objectives of the Humber and 
Severn River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs).  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
177 
 Management sche mes supported by the RBMPs will be encouraged within 
development proposals, such as the use of tree planting to reduce soil run -off into 
watercourses, standing water bodies and groundwater.  
 
Groundwater quality  
 
Where development has the potential to directly or indirectly pollute groundwater, a 
Groundwater Risk Assessment , demonstrating that the development proposal and 
subsequent works required will not lead to deterioration in groundwater quality and 
quantity , is needed to support the planning application.  
 
If a deterioration in groundwater quality cannot be avoided, there will be a 
presumption against the development proposal.  
 
All new housing and employment allocations with piled foundations or basements, 
within 1km of Ensor’s Pool Special Area of Conservation, should undertake a 
hydrogeological study to confirm that it will not affect groundwater flows or quality at 
the Special Area of Conservation.  
 
 
12.40  The NPPF promotes a sequential approach to identifying new land for 
development. This ensures that flood risk to people and property is avoided by 
selecting land at least risk of flooding considering the risk of flooding from all 
sources. Site layout and design are recognised as ways to influence t he risk 
and impact of flooding, and to provide resilience for climate change.  
 
12.41  Climate change is a key threat in terms of flooding. It is expected that peak 
rainfall intensity and peak river flow will increase during the plan period. This 
will increase both the size of the flood zones associated with rivers and the 
amount of flood experience d from other sources. The SFRA:  Level 2 (August  
2023) for Nuneaton and Bedworth updated previous flood zone maps to 
consider climate change111. The maps show that climate change will increase 
flood risk over time. The SFRA has been  updated to inform the review process 
in order to consider new legislation, further climate change predictions and 
better modelling.   
 
12.42  Monitoring of the chemical and ec ological status of the water bodies in the 
Humber and Severn River basin districts indicates that improvements in water 
quality are needed to reach  the environmental objectives that have been set 
across each of the districts112.  
 
12.43  This policy, and the legal  obligations imposed by the Flood and Water 
Management Act 2010 and the EU Water Framework Directive will help to 
address flood issues, adapt to climate change and reverse the decline in the 
chemical and ecological status of water bodies.

 Flood risk  
 
12.44  Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council lies in the River Trent Catchment 
Flood Management Plan (CFMP), Upper Soar and Upper Anker sub -region 
where policy option 4 has been allocated113. Policy 4 requires further action to 
sustain the current level of flood risk  into the future (responding to the potential 
increases in risk from urban development, land use change and climate 
change). ‘Policy NE4 – Managing flood risk and water quality’ aims to support 
this aim of the River Trent CFMP by effective management of fu ture 
development.  
 
12.45  The River Trent CFMP and the Humber and Severn Flood Risk Management 
Plans114 indicate the following measures are required to reduce the risk of 
flooding:  
 
• Directing development away from the floodplain.  
• Slowing rates of run -off in the upstream catchment in order to reduce 
surface water flooding (particularly in Bedworth).  
• Better understanding of the interaction between river and surface water 
flooding in order to help identify solutions in urban areas.  
• Assessing long -term opportunities to move development away from the 
floodplain and create green river corridors.  
• Considering future climate change and urban growth.  
• Returning watercourses to a more natural state, increasing biodiversity and 
opening up green river corridors.  
• Protecting and increasing the amount of Biodiversity Action Plan habitat in 
the catchment.  
• Making more space for rivers through urban areas via blue corridors, e.g.  
restoring access for floodwater onto key strips of floodplain.  
 
12.46  The Environment Agency  also publishe d the revised Flood Risk Management 
Plans  in December 2022  which span the period of 2021 – 2027.   
12.47  Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council’s Level 1115 and Level 2116  SFRAs 
are a Borough -level assessment of potential flood risk from all sources. All 
proposals should have regard to the findings of these assessments.  
 
12.48  Warwickshire County Council , in their role as LLFA , have published a Local 
Flood Risk Management Strategy. The strate gy ranks Nuneaton as number 10 
in the top 40 combined (historic and predictive) flood risk sites across 
Warwickshire through ordinary watercourses, surface water and sewer 
capacity.  Bedworth is ranked as number 7, with the nature of flood risk listed as

scheme) and surface water. Nuneaton Centre is ranked as number 24 with the 
main river, ordinary watercourse, surface water and sewer flooding all listed as 
the sources117. 
 
12.49 Section 10 of the Council’s IDP outlines the infrastructure requirements across 
the Borough regarding flooding and drainage, and states that “where  
development does occur in areas of flood risk, financial contributions obtained 
from planning applications m ay be used to mitigate the risk associated with the 
development”.  
 
Flood risk management schemes (flood defences)  
 
12.50 The SFRA : Level 2 also assessed the Borough’s flood defences.  Details of the 
flood defences, their standard of protection and conditio n were provided by the 
Environment Agency and should be taken into consideration where 
development may compromise the condition and function of the flood defence.  
 
SuDS  
 
12.51 In accordance with the NPPF and the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, 
SuDS are required to be implemented at all scales of development.   
 
12.52 As of 15th April 2015, Warwickshire County Council are statutory consultees on 
major planning applications f or surface water.  As announced in January 2023, 
it is the Government’s intention to enact Schedule 3 of the Flood and Water 
Management Act (2010) which will see Warwickshire County Council take on 
the role of SuDS Approving Body (SAB).  
 
12.53 Surface water run -off should be managed at source at a discharge rate no 
greater than the QBar greenfield rate, for all events up to the 1% annual 
probability plus climate change flood event.  
 
12.54 Surface water drainage systems should discharge in line w ith the drainage 
hierarchy, first considering the potential for rainwater harvesting and reuse 
then, in descending order of priority, considering infiltration, discharge to 
surface water bodies such as watercourses and finally discharge to the public 
sewer  network. Consideration should be given to the capacity of the receiving 
body, including an appreciation of any downstream assets e.g. culverts which 
may provide an additional constriction of flows.  
 
12.55 Where connecting into a 3rd party asset, such as a  public sewer, written 
acceptance of the connection from the asset owner will be required. This should 
confirm location and discharge rates are acceptable. Whilst higher capacities 
may be allowed by an asset owner, discharge rates should be in line with th e 
policy set out above.

180 
 12.56 The Environment Act (2021)118 also sets out changes to the water environment. 
Each sewerage undertaker now has a statutory requirement to prepare a 
Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan (DWMP) setting out the capacity 
of a s ewer system, future demands, resilience and other measures. The Severn 
Trent DWMP119 has now been published (2023).  
 
12.57 An increasing focus is also being put upon reducing Storm Overflows from 
sewer networks. The Environment Act sets out how the Secretar y of State must 
prepare a plan for the purpose of reducing discharge from storm overflows. The 
Severn Trent Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan (SODRP) (2023)120 
has now been published. The DWMP outlines how the plan aligns with the 
SODRP.  
 
12.58 The policy measures set out how , by reducing discharge amounts to the QBar 
greenfield runoff rate and discharging to water bodies other than sewer 
infrastructure, this has benefits as it meets the potential of the Environment Act 
objectives.  
 
12.59 Above -ground SuDS are required with all development. Well -designed SuDS, 
integrated with in a development’s landscaping and green infrastructure can 
provide multiple benefits thereby meeting many national and local policy 
objectives:  
 
• Flood risk: the controlled di scharge of surface water runoff will aid the 
downstream management of flows within a watercourse and thereby 
mitigate and potentially improve the risk of flooding.  
• Water quality: many SuDS features provide water quality improvements by 
slowing flows thereb y allowing the deposition of pollutant -carrying sediment 
and the filtration of water through vegetation such as reedbeds.  
• Amenity: there can be many facets of amenity through which SuDS provide 
benefits including improved air quality, reducing urban temper atures, 
sequestering carbon, providing educational and recreational spaces where 
everyone can interact with water, reducing noise through sound -absorption 
by vegetation and finally improving health and wellbeing.  
• Biodiversity: SuDS provide excellent habita ts for aquatic and non-aquatic 
flora and fauna, thereby helping to meet biodiversity net gain targets under 
the Environment Act (2021).  
 
12.60  Where this is not possible, developers should contact the LLFA at the earliest 
convenience, and ideally during the master planning process, for advice on 
suitable surface water drainage techniques. The Warwickshire County Council 
LLFA Flood Risk Guidance f or Development  should be taken into consideration 
when designing SuDS.

 Water quality  
 
12.61  A key requirement of the EU Water Framework Directive is the management 
and prevention of deterioration of the environment. This sits alongside the 
Government’s 25 Year Environment Plan121 to improve the environment within 
a generation. All development has a role to play in meeting these objectives 
and paragraph 174 of the NPPF supports this statement and policy.  
 
12.62  RBMPs are prepared by the Environment Agency under the direction of the  EU 
Water Framework Directive. The RBMPs indicate that the chemical and 
ecological status, in relation to the quality of surface water bodies and 
groundwater quality, are below current accepted standards. The RBMPs 
indicate that a number of measures are re quired to improve water quality, 
including:  
 
• Reducing the impact of diffuse pollution from rural and urban sources, 
including the use of S uDS. 
• Remediating contaminated land.  
• Improving and protecting habitats.  
 
12.63 As outlined earlier, the Environment Act (2021) places additional statutory 
duties on sewerage undertakers to understand and manage sewer capacity and 
for Government to plan for reducing storm overflows. This highlights the 
importance for development propo sals to use sewer networks as a last resort 
for surface water drainage.  
12.64 The Council will work in conjunction with Severn Trent with regards to water 
quality modelling in order to determine the potential for deterioration as a result 
of the growth an d increased sewage discharges across the Borough. Severn 
Trent will also consider the impact on concentrations in the rivers related to 
percentage deterioration, impact on current EU Water Framework Directive 
classifications, and potential for future EU Wa ter Framework Directive failures.  
12.65  Development proposals must therefore consider the impacts they may have on 
the water quality environment and how the proposals mitigate those impacts. 
For most development, an assessment utilising the Simple Index A pproach, as 
outlined in The SuDS Manual122, could be considered appropriate. However, 
for complex development or potentially contaminated sites, more detailed 
assessments, through escalating Land Contamination Risk Assessments, may 
be more appropriate.  
 
Groundwater quality  
 
12.66 Groundwater accounts for around a third of public water supply in England and 
Wales. Unfortunately, it is also under threat from unsustainable levels of 
 
121 HM Government (2018). A Green Future: Our 25 Year Plan to Improve the Environment.

 abstraction for drinking water, exceeding the rate at which rainfall can recharge 
aquifers. This in tur n causes further problems, as lower groundwater levels can 
affect river flows, wetlands and is seen as one of the causes for not achieving 
good ecological status in some rivers, lakes and estuaries. The higher Building 
Regulations requirements for water ef ficiency, as set out in Policy BE3 – 
Sustainable design and construction, will contribute towards ensuring 
sustainable water supply and abstraction.

Policy NE5 – Landscape character  
 
 
Major development proposals must demonstrate how they will conserve, enhance, 
restore or create a sense of place, as well as respond positively to the landscape 
setting in which the development proposal is located. Developers must take account 
of the Land Use Designations Study and landscape guidelines when preparing their 
landscape strategy.   
 
Key characteristics and distinctiveness  
 
Major development proposals must demonstrate that they are in balance with the 
setting of the local landscape and historic environment, respect the key 
characteristics and distinctiveness of that landscape, and in particular show how the 
proposal will:  
 
1. Conserve or enhance important landmark views.  
2. Conserve, enhance or create boundary features and field patterns including 
ridge and furrow topography.  
3. Conserve and where necessary enhance the strength of character and 
landscape condition.   
 
Landscape hierarchy  
 
Major development proposals must take account of the landscape strategy set out 
in the Landscape Character Assessment (2023). Outside of the strategic sites and 
urban area,  defined by the settlement boundaries,  developers must show they have 
sequentially considered development opportunities in areas of least landscape value 
first, prior to any development proposals being permitted in higher value landscape 
character areas.  The areas of search will follow the landscape hierarchy in the order 
set out below:   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
184 
 4. Restore and create.  
5. Enhance and restore.  
6. Enhance.  
7. Conserve and enhance.  
8. Conserve.  
 
 
12.71 The NPPF  says that valued landscapes should be protected and enhanced.  
Landscape planning policies should be informed by Landscape Character 
Assessments in order to help determine the likely impacts new development 
proposals will have on the landscape, against wh ich development proposals will 
be judged.  
 
12.72 This policy will ensure that any suitable development will take account of 
landscape character and that the Land Use Designations Study will be used to 
determine decisions in this respect.  
 
12.73 In 2016, TEP carried out site -specific Landscape Character Assessments . 
These were updated by FPCR in 2023123 in order to assess the landscape 
character and mitigation required for the identified strategic and some non-
strategic  sites. 
 
12.74 The landscape of Nuneaton and Bedworth is covered by 13 landscape 
character areas, none of which have national designation status.  Only one of 
the landscape character areas, Arbury Parklands, is considered to have a high 
landscape quality. The concept of landscape character areas will help to identify 
and understand local landscapes in terms of their diversity, character, 
distinctiveness and sensitivity to change, as well as where landscapes need to 
be conserved, enhanced, restored or created.  
 
Key charac teristics  
 
12.75 In the FPCR 2023 update  the 13 identified local landscape character areas 
each have their own set of key characteristics and key features. Some 
character areas have retained much of their characteristics and features, and 
have developed hi gher levels of strength of character, resulting in better 
landscape conditions.  Other character areas have lost much of their key 
characteristics and features to development, intensive agricultural practices 
and other human activities.   New development p roposals therefore will need to 
take full account of the development guidelines set out in the  Character 
Assessment124 and updated site -specific landscape sensitivity studies125.

185 
 Landscape hierarchy  
 
12.76 It is recognised that some areas in landscape terms are less able to adapt to 
accommodating development than others. This is reflected in the landscape 
strategies. Landscape Character Assessments assume that all landscapes 
have the potential to accommodate development, provided it is in keeping with 
their key characteristics. However, changes which do not respect the 
landscape’s key characteristics and features are likely to be detrimental to the 
local landscape character. Mitigation therefore is  likely to be least 
achievable /sympathetic in high quality landscapes, and more achievable where 
the landscape character is of a lesser quality. For this reason, the Council will 
take a more restrictive approach to development in the highest quality 
landsc apes, and direct development to landscapes of lesser value.  
 
12.77 The overall aim of a Landscape Character Assessment, and ultimately the 
planning, design and management of landscapes, is to achieve sustainable 
landscapes that are visually diverse, culturally rich and provide potential 
biodiversity opportunities, as well as being able to meet social, economic an d 
environmental needs. By conserving and creating landscape characteristics 
and features, Landscape Character Assessments become less about restricting 
development and more about how development can fit into the landscape by 
creating a distinct sense of pl ace. 
 
Borough Plan objectives  
 
12.78 This policy delivers the following Borough Plan objective:

Delivery mechanisms  
 
12.80 The delivery mechanisms for this policy are as follows:  
 
• Work with developers, Historic England and Warwickshire County Council ’s 
Archaeological Information and Advice Team, as well as others, to ensure 
that landscape character is considered when planning and designing new 
development.  
• Use the Land Use Designations Study as evidence to ensure that this p olicy 
is implemented.  
• Maintaining a five -year housing land supply will ensure the Borough’s 
valued landscapes will be protected.

 13.0  Built environment  
 
13.1 These policies outline requirements relating to the built environment.  
 
Policy BE1 – Contamination and land instability  
 
 
Development proposals located on or adjacent to land which may have been subject 
to contamination , land instability or likely to risk creating land instability that could 
adversely affect nearby land or infrastructure will need to demonstrate the following:  
 
1. That the site is suitable for its proposed use and that measures can be taken 
to mitigate effect ively the impacts arising from land contamination and 
instability on public health, environmental quality, the built environment and 
general amenity.  
2. That the development site is or will be made suitable for the proposed final 
use and will need to provide,  as a minimum, the following documents with the 
planning application (often referred to as a Preliminary Risk Assessment or 
desk study):  
a. Detailed site history identifying contaminative uses and land instability.  
b. The nature and agent of the contamination,  land instability and the 
hazards and risks posed.  
c. That any risks of creating land instability likely to adversely affect nearby 
land or infrastructure ha ve been adequately mitigated.  
 
Development proposals should also demonstrate consideration of pollutio n 
prevention measures during construction.  
 
 
13.2 The NPPF  provides guidance on how to deal with land contamination and 
instability. It states that the planning system is the process by which areas of 
land contamination and instability will be effectively remediated in relation to its 
location and use. However, t he responsibility for securing a safe development 
rest with the developer and /or landowner.  
 
13.3 Nuneaton and Bedworth’s long history of coal mining, quarrying and heavy 
engineering has left behind a legacy of land contamination and land instability , 
hazardous to human health and safety. This is reflected in the identification of 
over 3,100 potentially contaminated sites across the Borough, and a Coal 
Authority development high risk area that stretches across the Borough from 
Hawkesbury /Bedwort h/Bermud a/Stockingford /Whittleford /Nuneaton  Common 
through to North Warwickshire126. Despite this there are no sites , within the 
Borough , identified on the Contaminated Land Register, nor have any ‘special 
sites’ (highly toxic sites transferred to the Environment Agency for remediation) 
been identified in the Borough.

188 
 13.4  The following points outline some scenarios in which land instabil ity could be 
an issue for development:  
 
• Cut and fill scenarios to level sites – excess or unstable filled ground 
created. The new buildings should  not be affected because Building 
Regulations should identify the problem but there could be a risk of land 
slide or subsidence that could affect roads and land around the buildings.  
• Use of retaining walls to retain land – these should be assessed and 
designed to the relevant British/EU Standard.  
• Creation of balancing ponds in combination with the above – i.e. soi l used 
to retain large volumes of water, especially on sloping sites.  
• Underground structures – e.g. rainwater retention tanks, especially under 
roads and lorry parking areas.  
• Removal of established trees in shrinkable soils – may cause heave and 
damage to neighbouring properties. Usually factored into the Building 
Regulations design of new buildings, extensions etc but usually when work 
starts.  
• Open cast sites that are then back filled - there have been cases where the 
back fill assumptions have caused dam age to new buildings constructed on 
the once open cast site.  
 
Applying the precautionary principle  
 
13.5 The possibility of contamination should be assumed by developers when 
considering planning applications in relation to all land subject to or adjacent to 
previous industrial use. The precautionary principle should especially be 
applied where land uses are particularly sensitive to contamination, for 
example, housing, schools, hospitals and children’s play areas.  
 
Risk Assessment  
 
13.6 Part IIA o f the Environmental Protection Act 1990 states that the standard of 
remediation to be achieved through the granting of planning permission for new 
development (including permission for land remediation activities) is the 
removal of unacceptable risk and ex isting contaminant linkages, as well as to 
ensure the site is suitable for its new use. All receptors relevant to the site 
should be protected to an appropriate standard. It is essential therefore to 
ensure that the development of these sites leaves them s afe and suitable for 
the new uses.  
 
13.7 The need for the type and complexity of reports to accompany planning 
applications will depend on the specific site, and the level of contamination /land 
instability. This is particularly relevant where a planning c ondition is imposed 
prior to the granting of planning permission that requires a detailed remediation 
scheme.  
 
13.8 The Council supports the consideration of issues of land instability in 
development proposals.

Delivery mechanisms  
 
13.11 The delivery mechanism for this policy is as follows:  
 
• Work with Development Management, Environmental Health, the 
Environment Agency and the Coal Authority to identify contaminated sites 
and bring about remediation.  
 
Monitoring  
 
13.12 The indicator and target that will be monitored for this policy is outlined in Table 
38. 
 
Monitoring ref  Indicator  Target  
BE1a  Development of a 
potentially contaminated 
or unstable site.  Remediation is suitable 
for new use and is no 
longer considered 
contaminated.  
 
Table 38: Indicator and target to be monitored for Policy BE1.  
 
Policy BE2 – Renewable and low carbon energy  
 
 
To address the climate change emergency , schemes providing renewable and low 
carbon technologies will be supported unless material considerations indicate 
otherwise . These include schemes that promote biomass energy, ground and air 
source heat pumps, solar thermal and solar photovoltaic.   
 
Development should connect to any existing community /district heating schemes 
where appropriate or consider installing new combined systems, and should also 
consider the viability of biomass heating, combined heat and power, and utilising 
surplus heat.  
 
Devel opment must reflect the Climate Change Act 2008, zero carbon emissions by 
2050, the Environment Act 2021 and subsequent emerging Acts. Therefore, new  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
190 
 development must make use of sustainable transport, sustainable materials, 
minimise waste materials, make use of low carbon technologies, renewable energy 
and energy efficiency measures. The use of the higher Building Regulation 
requirements will be encouraged and supported.  
 
Proposals for retrofitting microgeneration technologies in existing developments will 
be approved, subject to a suitable assessment of the potential impacts to the local 
area. Community led initiatives for renewable and low carbon energy schemes will 
be approved.  
 
Wind Energy  
 
Proposals for small scale wind energy will be  supported  where appropriate in 
conjunction with the below criteria : 
 
1. No significant harm to the amenity of and safety of residential areas, 
particularly in relation to:  
a. Noise pollution, proximity and /or highway safety.  
b. Electromagnetic interference.  
c. Unacceptable shadow flicker.  
d. Impacts on aviation.  
2. Certified accreditation or similar evidence of the wind turbine meeting the 
RenewableUK Small Wind Turbine Performance and Safety Standard should 
be provided , with the planning application , prior to the granting of planning 
permission.  
3. A decommissioning scheme is in place. The applicant should expect that the 
Council will request that a bond be provided under a planning obligation to 
cover the cost of decommissioning and /or restoration of the site. 
 
When considering proposals for wind turbines, the Council will balance conflicting 
objectives, such as the need to increase renewable energy uptake , against the need 
to protect attractive landscapes, heritage, nature conservation and local amenity. 
Whilst some of these issues may be reduced through mitigation, the overall impact 
might still be unacceptable. Consequently, any benefits arising from wind turbine 
proposals will be weighed against their potential harm.   
 
 
13.13 The NPPF  states that the use and supply of renewable and low carbon energy 
should be increased through policies, in order to maximise renewable and low 
carbon energy development while ensuring that adverse impacts are addressed 
satisfactorily, including cumulative  landscape and visual impacts. The 
deployment of renewables will help tackle climate change by reducing 
emissions of carbon dioxide and help the country move towards a low carbon 
sustainable economy.  
 
13.14 The EU Renewable Energy Directive (2009) committe d the UK to source 15% 
of its total energy from renewable sources by 2020, increasing its renewable 
energy uptake by 12% from 2010.  Furthermore, on 27th June 2019 the UK 
Government amended the Climate Change Act 2008 so that the UK will be 
required to bri ng all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.  Both of  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
191 
 these legal requirements are a direct result of climate change and a fear that a 
five degree increase in global temperature will cause devastating impacts on 
global water supplies, food producti on, the economy, loss of life and a complete 
and unprecedented overturn in the way people live their lives.  
 
Residential and non -residential  
 
13.15  This policy supports the use of a range of renewable, low and zero carbon 
energy sources and technologies wh ich is essential to reduce energy waste, 
reduce fuel poverty, adapt for climate change and  contribut e to the 
Government’s commitment for the UK to become carbon neutral.  
 
13.16  Renewable and low carbon energy solutions include:  
 
• Biomass energy.  
• Ground and air source heat pumps.  
• Solar water heating.  
• Solar photovoltaics.  
• Combined heat and power /Combined cooling heat and power.  
• District heating network.  
 
13.17  The Feed -in Tariff and Renewable Heat Incentive are current Government 
schemes to encourage the use of renewable energy technologies. These 
incentives make  the use of renewable and low carbon energy more viable.  
 
13.18  A study conducted by Camco127 indicate s that renewable energy and low 
carbon energy has the potential to deliver between 9.5% and 12% of Nuneaton 
and Bedworth’s energy demand, summarised in  Table 39 .   
 
Energy type  GWh (%)  Potential percentage of 
Borough’s energy

Table 39: Potential renewable and low carbon energy generation by 2026 (Camco, 2010).  
 
Small -scale wind turbine energy  
 
13.19 Large -scale wind energy development is significantly constrained in the 
Borough. This is because land areas are restricted due to the potential proximity 
of wind turbines to housing and other buildings (based on a 600m buffer 
distance)128.   
 
127 Camco (2010). Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Resource Assessment and Feasibility Study.  
128 Camco (2010). Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Resource Assessment and Feasibility Study.  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
192 
  
13.20 In comparison to large -scale wind energy, small -scale wind energy 
development is far less imposing, being less visually intrusive and requiring less 
distance between wind turbines and buildings.  Small -scale wind turbines have 
capacity of less than 100kW, typically comprise of singe turbines and are 
usually ground -based developments with few installed on the roofs of 
buildings129. This makes small -scale wind energy development a sustainable 
and app ealing source of renewable energy in both the Borough’s urban and 
rural context.  
 
13.21 Onshore wind potential is low in the West Midlands , and within Nuneaton and 
Bedworth Borough specifically, due to limited wind speeds and built -up or 
protected areas130. However, there is still potential for small -scale wind energy 
developments , with higher wind speeds reported adjacent to the northern and 
north -western bounda ries of the Borough  within North Warwickshire131. 
Therefore, t he uptake of small -scale wind turbines will be promoted and 
encouraged , to contribute to the overall renewable energy mix , as there is still 
potential for this form of develop ment.  
 
13.22 The RenewableUK Small Wind Turbine Standard provides an assured level of 
safety, power performance and acoustic noise measurements. The standard 
aims to provide consumers with a measure of confidence in small wind turbine 
products.  
 
13.23 The decommission ing of wind turbines is often an afterthought, but it is critical 
that turbines are taken down responsibly. Conditions will be applied to planning 
consents for wind turbines requiring that the land be restored to its previous use 
when the operation of the wind turbines has expired (for example, after 25 
years). Full restoration may require the removal of turbines, ancillary structures 
and restoration of appropriate vegetation, depending on the nature of the site.

All Development proposals must be:  
 
1. Designed to a high standard and meet the ten characteristics of the National 
Design Guide and National Model Design Codes132. Designed to meet the 
requirements specified in any relevant extant Concept Plan SPD  and the 
Sustainable Design and Construction SPD (2020) .  
2. Able to evidence efficient use and protection of natural resources.  
3. Able to evidence that new developments are wate r efficient, incorporating 
water efficiency and re -use measures and that the estimated consumption of 
wholesome water per dwelling is calculated in accordance with the 
methodology in the water efficiency calculator, not exceeding 110 
litres /person /day (or any future reduction stated within an updated version of 
the Building Regulations 2010).  
4. Able to evidence that new development will maximise energy efficiency and 
meet the optional higher standard for Building Regulations in regard to energy  
use. Developme nt should adhere to the Future Homes and Buildings 
Standard, prior to its introduction in 2025, by promoting a fabric first approach, 
including the use of passive design principles where possible.

 5. Minimise the potential for pollution of air, soil, noise an d light, and in particular 
not contribute to unacceptable levels of air pollution.  
6. Adaptable, resilient and minimise climate change impact s to achieve the 
nation’s carbon net zero emissions target by 2050.  
7. Able to reduce crime by demonstrating where the principles of Secured by 
Design have been incorporated into the design including consideration of 
wider security and defence.  
8. Able to promote sustainable transport.  
9. Able to promote placemaking strategies for an inclusive , safe, acc essible and 
healthy living environment for all.  
 
Urban character  
 
All development proposals must contribute to local distinctiveness and character by 
reflecting the positive attributes of the neighbouring area and respecting the 
sensitivity to change of th e generic character types within each urban character 
area. Development must take a comprehensive and co -ordinated approach, 
respecting existing constraints, including utilities, situated within each site. Key 
characteristics to consider include:  
 
10. Current use of buildings.  
11. Ownership /tenure.  
12. Street layout.  
13. Patterns of development.  
14. Residential amenity.  
15. Plot size and arrangement.  
16. Built form.  
 
Heritage assets  
 
Heritage assets can be a valuable aid to achieving sustainable development, in both 
climate change mitigation and adaption. For example, retaining, repairing, 
refurbishing, retrofitting and reusing heritage assets, and especially historic 
buildings, can contribute to reducing carbon emissions. The historic environment is 
also important in respect  of the embodied carbon value of buildings. In particular, 
the contribution that the retention and reuse of old buildings makes, together with 
the sustainability of traditional building materials and design.  
 
Residential  
 
Residential development must meet 95% M4(2) and 5% M4(3) Building Regulations 
standards for access, the NDSS  and the principles set out within the relevant SPDs 
(including the Future Homes and Buildings Standard where technically and 
financially feasible).  Where assessment methods are changed or superseded, the 
appropriate replacement standards will be used.  
 
All residential developments must be designed with sufficient private outdoor 
amenity space to promote health and wellbeing.  
 
Major development propos als must also provide a statement , with their application , 
showing how their proposal will:   Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
195 
  
17. Meet all of the 12 considerations in Building for a Healthy Life.  Where it is 
not possible to positively meet all considerations, a statement of justification 
must be provided to explain why it is not possible, and what mitigation 
measures will take place to offset this.  
18. Install rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling systems in the curtilage 
of all new buildings.  
19. Integrate the principles of passive solar desi gn. 
20. Be able to accommodate the flexible needs of occupants.  
  
Development proposals for estate regeneration will be supported where they deliver 
high quality, well designed housing and improved public space.  
 
Commercial  
 
Major non -domestic (commercial) development proposals must meet the Building 
Research Establishment’s Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) very 
good standard for new construction projects, using the most up -to-date new 
construction version of BREEAM , or equivalent LEED  standard, where technically 
and financially feasible.  
 
21. Applicants must submit a pre -assessment , as part of an application , 
demonstrating the proposed design will meet the BREEAM very good 
standard.  
22. Applicants are also required to submit c ertificates once the development has 
been completed at post construction.  
 
Where assessment methods are changed or superseded, the appropriate 
replacement standards will be used.  
 
Sustainable construction  
 
Development must minimise or re -use waste generate d during the construction 
phase. This should be done by using materials and construction techniques that 
generate the least waste and minimise emissions. Waste should be treated as a 
resource to be re -used, recycled or recovered, and should only be dispose d of when 
all other options have been explored.   
 
On-site management of waste will be preferred, unless the activities would result in 
unacceptable harm through impacts on the environment, transport, neighbouring 
uses or that management elsewhere would ha ve wider sustainability benefits.  
 
Where a developer considers meeting any of the above requirements is unviable or 
can demonstrate that they are not suited to local circumstances, an independent 
Viability Assessment must be submitted with the application . 
 
 
13.28 The NPPF  states that good design is a key aspect of sustainable design by 
creating better places for communities. This includes individual buildings, public 
and private spaces, and wider area development schemes . Paragraph  110 
specifically refers to the requiremen t for development proposals to reflect  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
196 
 current national guidance which includes the ten  characteristics of the National 
Design Guide and National Model Design Codes. Therefore, this has been 
included within Policy BE3.  
 
13.29 There are a number of key issues in Nuneaton and Bedworth that would benefit 
from the sustainable design and construction of new development. These 
issues include:  
 
• Existing AQMAs.  
• Low levels of car ownership.  
• Poor health and lower life expectancy.  
• High crime and perception of crim e. 
• High levels of fuel poverty.  
 
13.30 This policy will help to address these issues by ensuring development is of a 
high quality; minimises the release of air pollutants into the atmosphere; is not 
unreasonably noisy or otherwise obtrusive; is accessible to local shops, 
services and public transportation; meets the existing or future circumstances 
of residents, workers and visitors; is safe; is energy and water efficient; and is 
equipped to adapt to climate change and aid zero carbon emission 
developments.  
 
13.31 Regarding fire safety, i n the unlikely event that buildings are proposed which 
contain two or more dwellings, or educational accommodation, and meet the 
height condition of 18m or more, or 7 or more storeys, the Planning Gateway 
One133 must be adhered to and details submitted with the application.    
 
Water efficiency  
 
13.32 The NPPF states that local authorities should take water supply and demand 
into full account in their strategies and local plans. The West Midlands Climate 
Change Risk Assessment and Adaptation Plan (2021 -2026)134 identifies that 
the Severn Trent Water region is already seriously water stressed and supply 
is likely to become more constrained with drier summers and an increasing 
population. The Water Cycle Stud y (2017) (which is currently being update) 
also identifies a number of wastewater treatment works, across the sub -region, 
which are currently operating at capacity, or will be at some point across the 
plan period135. As a result, the Council aims to help th e sub -region achieve a 
water neutral position . 
 
13.33 In 2021 the Environment Agency classed the Severn Trent region as Seriously 
Water Stressed136. This new approach includes the impact of climate change, 
pressure on the environment and how to meet the challenges they create. The 
updated water stress method takes a long -term view of the availability and the

residential buildings.

197 
 demand for public water supply, rather tha n a snapshot of shorter or peak 
periods. It accounts for future population growth, climate change, environmental 
needs and increased resilience. The results of this revision in classification, 
categorises the Severn Trent region as ‘seriously water stresse d’. 
 
13.34 The Humber RBMP137 covers the Severn Trent region. Section 3.2 identifies 
measures to prevent deterioration and protect the water environment and the 
benefits it provides. The section titled ‘Changes to natural flow and levels of 
water’ identifie s a role that regulators, operators, influencers and project 
undertakers have, to make sure water is used efficiently.  
 
Passive solar design and energy use  
 
13.35 Passive solar design is a technique that exploits local climate and site 
conditions in order to minimise the need to use energy. It uses free renewable 
sources of energy such as sun and wind to provide heating, cooling, ventilation 
and natural lighting, re ducing the need to use conventional space heating and 
cooling. Because passive solar design lessens the need to use traditional 
heating systems, annual energy bills can be cut by a third and carbon emissions 
reduced, with cost savings paid back in two year s.   
 
13.36 Including passive solar concepts into the design is not difficult to apply; it simply 
requires consideration at the preliminary stages of design. When used correctly, 
passive solar buildings are comfortable, economically efficient, durable, 
aesthetically appealing and environmentally responsible.  
 
13.37 With the introduction of the Environment Act, emerging legislation, carbon 
neutrality by 2050 and climate change predictions, it is considered that the 
higher Building Regulations for  energy efficiency, Future Homes and Building 
Standards  should be included in the Borough Plan  Review policy, from its 
adoption, rather than waiting for the new Building Regulations to come into 
force. This is to promote a fabric first approach and passive  design principles 
and therefore, will invoke the spirit of the Environment Act 2021 as early as 
possible.  
 
13.38 Integrating passive solar design, passive house concepts and energy efficiency 
into new developments will have significant economic benefits f or people 
buying or renting new properties in the Borough. This will also result in better 
social conditions and improve the environment and carbon emissions.  
 
Crime and fear of crime  
 
13.39 A survey of Nuneaton and Bedworth residents in 2020138 found that 92% of 
respondents had not been either a victim or witness of a crime in the last 12 
months of the survey. However, a high proportion of respondents were worried 
about having their home broken into and something stolen (75%) or having their 
 
137 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (2015). Part 1: Humber River  basin district – 
RBMP.  
138 Business Intelligence (2020). Your Say on Community Safety Survey Results Nuneaton and 
Bedworth Borough Residents.    Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
198 
 car stolen (69%). 92% of respondents felt that anti -social behaviour was a 
problem in their area. Therefore, crime and fear of crime still remain a significant 
factor in undermining residents’ quality of life. Nuneaton and Bedworth also ha s 
the highest level of offences per thousand households across Warwickshire139. 
 
13.40 Despite some improvements in peoples’ perception of crime and burglary rates, 
there still remains a significant threat to property and the safety and welfare of 
residents and visitors. Conse quently, new development proposals must 
consider the robustness of buildings, so that they can withstand unwanted 
intrusions, as well as consider the safety of residents  and visitors in terms of 
accessibility and visibility within the surrounding area.  
 
BREEAM  
 
13.41 BREEAM is a credit -based assessment system that aims to reduce the 
environmental impacts throughout construction and operation of a building. 
BREEAM considers all areas of sustainability, such as ecology, energy use, 
water consumption, waste ma nagement, lighting and location, resulting in a 
best practice approach to developing sustainable buildings which are adaptable 
to climate change.  
 
13.42 As well as these environmental benefits, meeting at least a very good BREEAM 
standard can reduce energy and running costs, demonstrate environmental 
credentials to potential customers and create an improved image for the 
company.  
 
13.43 As an alternative to BREEAM, development can use the alternative scheme 
LEED  certification.  
 
Sustainable construction  
 
13.44 To ensure that the construction of new buildings does not have a negative 
impact on the environment, proposals are required to consider minimising 
waste and emissions that are generated as a result of construction.  
 
13.45 Developers sh ould use the waste hierarchy when dealing with waste resulting 
from construction, in the order of re -use, recycle or recover  and disposal should 
be a last resort measure when the other options are not suitable. Wherever 
possible, on -site management of wast e should be pursued.

settings of townscapes including canals, will be approved.  
 
Developme nt affecting a designated or non -designated heritage asset and its setting 
will be expected to make a positive contribution to its character, appearance and 
significance.  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
200 
 To conserve and enhance the Borough’s heritage assets, development proposals 
must:  
 
1. Understand the asset and its setting  
 
Applications affecting the significance of a heritage asset will be required to provide 
sufficient information and assessment (such as desk -based appraisals, field 
evaluations and historic building rep orts) of the impacts of the proposal on the 
significance of heritage assets and their setting, in order to demonstrate how that 
proposal would contribute to the asset’s conservation. This assessment must 
determine the significance of the archaeological rem ains and assess the 
implications of the development on those remains. The level of detail should be 
proportionate to the importance of the asset and should comply with any relevant 
supporting local plan documents.  
 
Applicants should take account of the heritage asset’s communal, aesthetic, 
evidential and historical values.  
 
2. Conserve the asset and its setting  
 
Great weight will be given to the conservation of the Borough’s heritage assets and 
their settings, with greater weight being given to assets of hi gher importance. Any 
harm to the significance of a designated or non -designated heritage asset must be 
justified. Proposals causing harm will be weighed against the public benefits of the 
proposal in the following ways:  
 
• Whether it has been demonstrated th at all reasonable efforts have been 
made to sustain the existing use, find new uses or mitigate the extent of the 
harm to the significance of the asset.  
• Whether the works proposed are the minimum required to secure the long -
term use of the asset.  
 
Schedule d monuments and other non -designated archaeological sites of equivalent 
importance should be preserved in -situ. Development proposals that would result in 
the removal or destruction of remains of archaeological interest that are considered 
to be of equival ent significance to a scheduled monument will not normally be 
permitted, as substantial harm or loss should be wholly exceptional.  
 
Development that would adversely affect other important archaeological remains will 
only be acceptable where:  
 
• the benefits of development outweigh the harm to the remains and the value 
of ret aining them in situ . 
• the degree of disturbance has been minimised .  
• satisfactory provision is made for the evaluation, excavation, recording and 
interpretation of the remains befo re commencement of the development.  
 
Where there are likely to be valuable archaeological remains, archaeological 
evaluation, which may include  a geophysical survey and /or trial trenching , is likely 
to be required prior to the determination of any planning application.  
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
201 
 The advice of W arwickshire County Council  Archaeological Information and Advice 
should be sought prior to any submission.   
 
Where harm to any heritage assets can be fully just ified, and development would 
result in the partial or total loss of the asset and /or its setting, the applicant will be 
required to secure a programme of recording and analysis of that asset, 
archaeological excavation where relevant, and ensure the publica tion of that record 
to an appropriate standard.  
 
Where applicable, further investigation into archaeological remains may need to be 
undertaken prior to determination of planning applications and mitigation measures 
proposed need to be included within the submitted documents. Planning conditions 
will be u tilised to ensure the continued protection of important archaeological 
features in situ, where development can take place.  
 
Change of use in Nuneaton  and Bedworth  Town Centre Conservation Area s 
 
Where a change of use is proposed in  Nuneaton  or Bedworth  Town Centre 
Conservation Area s from class E to class C3 at ground floor, robust evidence and 
justification of the necessity for a change of use will need to be provided to support 
such an application.  
 
 
13.50 National planning policy on the historic environment provides guidance on the 
identification, significance  and protection of heritage assets. These assets 
include listed buildings, conservation areas, registered parks and gardens, and 
archaeological remains.  National policy expects that the contribution of such 
heritage assets to local character and sense of place is recognised and valued.  
 
13.51 The Warwickshire Historic Environment Record, the Borough’s Conservation 
Area Character Appraisals and Management Plans, the local list of non -
desig nated heritage assets and Historic Landscape Characterisation Project 
are examples of sources of information that will be used to inform the 
consideration of future development, including potential conservation and 
enhancement measures.  
 
13.52  The Heritage Assessment has informed the policies within the Borough Plan 
Review. A Heritage SPD is due to be produced to provide more localised 
guidance on the different typologies of heritage assets.  
 
13.53  The Borough’s heritage consists of approximate ly 90 listed buildings and 
approximately 90 non -statutory listed buildings , 5 conservation areas, 2 
registered parks and gardens , and 2 scheduled monuments. Two buildings 
located in the Borough are currently on Historic England’s Heritage at Risk 
Register.  The Council is working with Historic England to find solutions on how 
to save these buildings.  
 
Registered parks and gardens and scheduled monuments  
 
13.54 The majority of registered sites are the grounds of private houses . However, 
public parks and cemeteries form important categories.  This is consistent with  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
202 
 the Arbury Hall and Bedworth Cemetery registered sites.  Arbury Hall registered 
park and garden is grade II* listed.  It is believed to be the only stately home in 
Britain to have a private system of canals (built in the 18th century) running 
through the gardens.  
 
13.55 Bedworth Cemetery registered park and garden is grade II listed.  It is a 
municipal cemetery and was consecrated in 1874.  The site is around 3ha and 
consists of a number of entrances, several groups of specimen trees, a 
promenade and a war memorial.  
 
13.56 Legal protection for nationally important sites and monuments is achieved 
through the scheduling of sites under the Ancient Monuments and 
Archaeologica l Areas Act 1979.  Exhall Hall scheduled monument consists of 
upstanding earthworks and buried building remains of a variety of features.   
 
13.57 The Benedictine Priory and Precinct of St Mary scheduled monument was built 
in the 13th century and was one o f only four Benedictine nunneries in England 
identified as belonging to the important Abbey of Fontevrault.  The priory closed 
in 1539 as a result of the Dissolution. The priory is also one of the few surviving 
nunneries with a church and outer precinct co mplex preserved in a fully urban 
context.  
 
13.58 Both the registered parks and gardens and scheduled monuments, as well as 
their setting, are unique and are of significant historical and cultural importance 
to the Borough and will be given due protection.  
 
Non-designated heritage assets  
 
13.59 In comparison with neighbouring local authorities, the Borough has only a small 
amount of designated historic heritage, reflecting the fact that much of the built 
environment dates from the late Victorian period and the 20th century.  This is 
an important point, as after 1840, selection criteria for listed buil dings became 
progressively more difficult. It is important, therefore, to protect these 
designated assets and recognise the Borough’s wider heritage assets.  
 
13.60 The Council’s list of non -designated heritage assets is currently being reviewed. 
These loca lly listed heritage assets include buildings, monuments  and places 
that contribute to the distinctive local character of the Borough. The review will 
undertake a comprehensive review of buildings of local architectural and 
historical interest. This will in volve the local community in the identification and 
selection of additional assets.   
 
13.61 Locally listed heritage assets are not afforded the same degree of legislative 
protection (particularly from demolitions and alterations not requiring planning 
permission) as statutory listed buildings. In line with national guidance, this 
policy recognise s that local heritage deserves a level of protection appropriate 
to its value.  
 
 
  Borough Plan Review - Publication Draft  Plan  
 
203 
 Archaeology  
 
13.62 Archaeological sites of national and local importance are identified in the 
Warwickshire Historic Environment Record140. Any further archaeological finds 
will be added to the record through the Development Management process, 
with the expectation that desk -based assessment and field evaluation will be 
carried out for development proposals affecting sites of possible archaeological 
interest. 
 
Conservation areas  
 
13.63 Conservation areas are designated under the provisions of Section 69 of the 
Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 for their “special 
architectural and historic interest, the character and appearance of which it is 
desirable to preserve or enhance”. The Borough has five conservation areas:  
 
• Abbey Conservation Area.  
• Bedworth Town Centre Conservation Area.  
• Bulkington Conservation Area.  
• Hawkesbury Junction Conservation Area.  
• Nuneaton Town Centre Conservation Area.  
 
13.64 Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans  describe the key 
characteristics of each of the Borough’s conservation areas and  will be used to 
identify and assess lo cal character and promote enhancement s. The 
designation of additional conservation areas along the Coventry Canal and the 
Ashby Canal , within the Borough , will be progressed.  
 
13.65 This policy will ensure that heritage assets are safeguarded or, where possible, 
enhanced. It will inspire suitable development to take place which respects both 
urban and landscape heritage that brings wider benefits to communities. The 
benefits of implem enting the policy will include improvement in the quality of the 
built and natural historic environment, improvements in architectural design, as 
well as the creation of stronger local identity and sense of place.  
 
Change of use in Nuneaton  and Bedworth  Town Centre Conservation Area s 
 
13.66 Commercial activity is a key characteristic  of both the Nuneaton  and Bedworth  
Town Centre C onservation Areas and any change of use away from this 
characteristic would be detrimental to the conservation area s.

class a particular use falls into141. 
 
Class B   
 
B2 General industrial - Use for an industrial process other than one falling within 
class E(g) (excluding incineration purposes, chemical treatment , landfill or hazardous 
waste).

learning disabilities or mental health problems.  
 
C3(c)  allows for groups of people (up to six) to live together as a single 
household. This allows for those groupings that do not fall within the C4 HMO 
definition, but which fell within the previous C3 use class, to be provided for . 
For example, a small religious community  may fall into this section as could a 
homeowner who is living with a lodger.

Sui Generis  
 
'Sui generis' is a Latin term that, in this context, means ‘in a class of its own’. Certain 
uses are specifically defined and excluded from classification by legislation, and 
therefore become  ‘sui generis’. These are theatres, amusement arcades /centres or 
funfairs, launderettes, fuel stations, hiring, selling and /or displaying motor vehicles, 
taxi businesses, scrap yards , or a yard for the storage /distribution of minerals and /or 
the breaking o f motor vehicles, ‘Alkali work’ (any work registerable under the Alkali, 
etc. Works Regulation Act 1906 (as amended)), hostels (providing no significant 
element of care), waste disposal installations for the incineration, chemical treatment 
or landfill of hazardous waste, retail warehouse clubs, nightclubs, casinos, betting 
offices/shops, pay day loan shops, public houses, wine bars, or drinking 
establishments, drinking establishments with expanded food provision, hot food 
takeaways (for the sale of hot foo d where consumption of that food is mostly 
undertaken off the premises), venues for live music performance, cinemas, concert 
halls, bingo halls and dance halls.

air to water systems. The heat pump increases the temperature  and the heat is used 
to provide heating or hot water.  The pump needs electricity to run but uses less  energy 
than the heat it produces. It performs the same role as a boiler, but it uses ambient 
heat rather than burning fuel to generate heat.  
 
Air Quality Management Area (AQMA):  A designated area where there is a 
likelihood that the air quality objectives , set out in the Air Quality Regulations 2000 , 
will not be met.  
 
Affordable housing:  Social rented, affordable rented and intermediate housing,
