8Preface
Lewisham will continue to be a welcoming 
place where the culture and diversity of our 
people, and the unique qualities of local 
neighbourhoods, is recognised and protected. We 
will always celebrate what makes us different and 
have a strong sense of community. We will give 
people the security and certainty they need so 
that everyone can live their best lives.
Lewisham will be a place where all generations 
not only live but also thrive. A place that people 
want to visit and live in, and where they choose 
to stay and enjoy a good quality of life. A 
place where you can get on, regardless of your 
background and where you are always treated 
fairly and are supported to achieve your full 
potential.  
 
Lewisham will continue to be a dynamic place, 
reflecting the strength of its communities, and 
partnership working with our community remains 
at our core. We are proud of the vibrancy of our 
high streets, local businesses, arts and cultural 
establishments, our evening and night-time 
economy and our world renowned institutions. 
We will not only protect them but grow them. We 
will contribute to and share in more of London’s 
future prosperity, becoming a greener, healthier 
and more resilient place by leading the way in 
responding to the global climate emergency.  
 
Most of all, we want you to love living in 
Lewisham.

of an Open London
1.1 Lewisham’s Local Plan sets out a 
shared vision for the future of the 
Borough along with the planning 
and investment framework to deliver 
this vision through to 2040. 
1.2 This Local Plan has been prepared to ensure 
there is a clear framework in place to manage 
growth and deliver sustainable development in 
a way that respects the distinctive character and 
diversity of the Borough and its people. It will 
help to ensure that planning and investment 
decisions help to meet local needs, respond 
to the aspirations of our communities and 
contribute to inclusive, safe, healthy and liveable 
neighbourhoods. 
1.3 The concept of ‘Good Growth’ underpins the 
London Plan (2021). Good Growth is growth 
that is socially and economically inclusive and 
environmentally sustainable1.  Sitting alongside 
this is the Mayor of London’s ambition for the 
Capital to be ‘A City for all Londoners’. The 
main objective of this Local Plan for ‘An Open 
Lewisham as part of an Open London’ responds 
to these aspirations recognising that Lewisham is 
an integral part of London.1.4 The successful delivery of the Local Plan will 
require strong and effective partnership working. 
The Council will continue to take a leadership 
role in planning positively for the Borough and 
ensuring equality of opportunity. Through our 
unique ways of working, known as the ‘Lewisham 
Way’, we will work with and alongside public and 
private sector stakeholders, local communities 
and community groups as well as local residents 
to realise the Local Plan objectives, so that 
everyone in Lewisham can enjoy a good quality 
of life.

1 ABOUT LEWISHAM’S LOCAL PLANThe planning framework
1.5 Lewisham’s Local Plan is prepared within the 
context of a wider planning framework. This sets 
the main parameters for the plan making process, 
as well as the contents of local plans and how they 
should operate. The Planning and Compulsory 
Purchase Act 2004 is primary legislation that 
provides the main basis for the plan-led system in 
England. It is supported by secondary legislation, 
including the Town and Country Planning (Local 
Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 (as 
amended), which provide further details on the 
process for the Council to prepare and adopt the 
local plan and other supporting documents. 
National planning policy and the London Plan
1.6 The Local Plan is required to be consistent with 
national policy, including the National Planning 
Policy Framework (NPPF) (2021) and planning 
Circulars. The NPPF sets out the Government’s 
planning policies for England and how they 
should be applied. It includes parameters for the 
preparation of local plans and is also a material 
consideration in planning decisions. The NPPF is 
supported by National Planning Practice Guidance 
(NPPG).
1.7 The Local Plan must also be in general conformity 
with the regional planning policies contained 
in the London Plan, which is produced by the 
Mayor of London. The London Plan is the Spatial 
Development Strategy for Greater London. It helps 
to ensure a coordinated approach to planning 
across all boroughs. The London Plan forms part 
of Lewisham’s development plan, meaning it 
must be taken into account in planning decisions. 
The London Mayor also prepares Supplementary 
Planning Guidance (SPG) documents that support 
implementation of the London Plan.Lewisham’s development plan
1.8 Lewisham’s statutory development plan consists 
of the Local Plan along with the London Plan 
and adopted neighbourhood plans. Planning 
applications must be determined in accordance 
with the development plan, unless material 
considerations indicate otherwise2.  The diagram 
below illustrates how the Local Plan and its 
supporting documents sit within the wider 
planning framework.
1.9 Once adopted Lewisham’s new Local Plan 2020-
2040 will replace the Core Strategy (2011), Site 
Allocations Local Plan (2013), Development 
Management Local Plan (2014) and Lewisham 
Town Centre Local Plan (2014).

1 ABOUT LEWISHAM’S LOCAL PLANHow the plan has been 
prepared
Key stages
1.10 There are a number of stages involved in the 
preparation of a local plan along with procedures 
that the Council is required to comply with 
throughout. These stages and requirements are 
prescribed by national policy and legislation. 
This includes the undertaking of multiple rounds 
of public consultation before a draft local plan 
can be submitted to the Secretary of State for 
independent public examination.
1.11 Figure 1.2  sets out the key stages of the plan 
making process, highlighting the current stage of 
production3.

18Evidence base
1.12 The evidence base is made up of studies 
and supporting documents that inform the 
preparation of the new Local Plan. These have 
been prepared both by the Council and other 
organisations, including government bodies. 
The evidence base helps to ensure that the 
approaches and policies in the Local Plan are 
appropriate and justified, taking into account the 
latest available information.
1.13 Our evidence base comprises technical studies, 
research reports, site and area masterplans and 
other information covering a variety of policy 
topic areas. We have consulted local communities 
and other stakeholders on the preparation of 
some evidence base documents. This includes 
the Lewisham Characterisation Study (2019), 
the New Cross Area Framework (2019),  Catford 
Town Centre Framework (2021) and A21 
Development Framework (2022). The evidence 
base documents are available on the Council’s 
website. Integrated Impact Assessment
1.14 An Integrated Impact Assessment (IIA) helps to 
inform the preparation of the Local Plan. It is a 
detailed analysis of the potential environmental, 
social and economic effects of the plan. The IIA 
brings different types of assessment together 
into a single process, including:
• Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)
• Sustainability Appraisal (SA)
• Equalities Impact Assessment (EqIA)
• Health Impact Assessment (HIA)
1.15 The IIA is undertaken as an iterative process 
during the plan’s preparation. It includes 
assessments of preferred policy approaches and 
reasonable alternatives. Reports are published 
and consulted on at key stages in the plan 
process, often alongside draft Local Plan 
documents. The IIA helps to identify potential 
issues at an early stage so that measures to 
avoid or mitigate harm, and improve expected 
outcomes, can be incorporated into the plan.
1.16 A separate Habitats Regulations Assessment 
(HRA) is also carried out to assess whether 
protected habitats and species may be adversely 
impacted by the plan’s implementation4. 
4 Designated under European Union council Directive 
on the conservation of wild birds (79/409/ EEC) 1992, 
European Union council Directive on the conservation of 
natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (92/43/EEC) 
1992 and Ramsar Convention on wetlands of international 
importance.

1 ABOUT LEWISHAM’S LOCAL PLANTests of soundness
1.17 The Local Plan sets out an ambitious 
programme to help facilitate investment in 
our neighbourhoods and sustainably manage 
growth over the long-term. To realise the plan’s 
vision and to secure the new homes, jobs and 
infrastructure required for Lewisham, the plan 
must be demonstrated to be deliverable. The 
NPPF sets out ‘tests of soundness’ that help to 
ensure deliverability. The soundness of the plan is 
assessed at the examination stage.Duty to Cooperate
1.18 The Localism Act (2011), subsequent regulations 
and the NPPF place a statutory duty on local 
planning authorities to cooperate with each 
other, and other bodies, when preparing, or 
supporting the preparation of policies which 
address strategic matters. This includes those 
policies contained in local plans. The Council 
has and will continue to work positively with 
its neighbouring authorities and other relevant 
public bodies to identify and address issues of 
strategic importance during the preparation and 
implementation of Lewisham’s new Local Plan.   
Table 1.1: Tests of soundness for local plans (NPPF, paragraph 35)
20How to use the plan 
1.19 The Local Plan sets out a vision, 
strategic objectives and planning 
policies that together provide the 
overarching framework for the 
delivery of sustainable development 
in the Borough. It covers the 
twenty-year period from 2020 to 
2040.  The plan will help to support 
implementation of the London Plan 
and its Good Growth policies.
1.20 For legibility the Local Plan is set out in five main 
parts and sub-sections that cover a range of 
thematic policy areas however it must be read as 
a whole. The order of topics and policies is not a 
reflection of their weight or importance5.  
1.21 The Local Plan is organised into five main 
parts:
5  This also applies to the Key Spatial Objectives and 
policies for each of the character areas set out in Part 3 
of the Local Plan.
21
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
1 ABOUT LEWISHAM’S LOCAL PLANStrategic and non-
strategic policies
1.22 The Council is legally required to identify the 
strategic priorities for the development and use 
of land in the Borough, and to set out policies to 
address these in the local plan6.  The NPPF also 
makes clear that local plans should identify and 
clearly distinguish strategic policies from other 
non-strategic policies7.  A schedule of the Local 
Plan non-strategic policies is included in Part 5 
of the Local Plan. Those policies not included in 
the schedule are strategic policies.
Community engagement and neighbourhood 
planning
1.23 We will continue to work with local communities 
and community groups, including residents’ 
groups and amenity societies, to improve 
transparency and openness in decision-making, 
and to foster greater public understanding of 
and involvement in the planning process. Further 
information on the Council’s procedures for 
public consultation on planning decisions is set 
out in the Statement of Community Involvement 
(SCI), which is available on our planning 
webpage.1.24 The Council has a statutory duty to support 
designated neighbourhood forums in the 
preparation of neighbourhood plans. We will 
work positively with forums to ensure their plans 
appropriately support the Council’s strategic 
planning priorities, so that they have the best 
chance of succeeding at the examination stage 
and can be formally adopted. This Local Plan 
is presented in a new format that responds to 
the strong interest in neighbourhood planning 
in Lewisham. For example, Part Three sets 
key objectives and priorities for the Borough’s 
character areas. It provides a useful reference 
point from which neighbourhood forums, and 
other community groups, can work to support 
the Local Plan’s implementation.
1.25 Neighbourhood plans are required to be 
consistent with the strategic policies in 
Lewisham’s development plan and should only 
include non-strategic policies, as set out in the 
NPPF .

26Introduction 
2.1 This section provides an overview of Lewisham 
in the context of London. It draws on the latest 
available information to provide a snapshot 
of the Borough and its people looking at the 
current situation and considering future trends.  
This information highlights some of the main 
challenges and opportunities for the Local Plan 
to address.Lewisham in context
Location
2.2 Lewisham is an inner-London borough located 
to the south of the River Thames. As shown in 
Figure 2.2  it has good transport links to the rest 
London, including the Central Activities Zone, 
along with connections to the wider South East 
of England. Lewisham is bordered to the north 
by the Thames and the London boroughs of 
Southwark to the west, Greenwich to the east 
and Bromley to the south.

30Population
2.3 Like London, Lewisham has experienced a 
sustained period of population growth. The 
Borough’s population grew from 248,900 in 
20018to an estimated 306,950 people in 20209, 
an increase of roughly 23 per cent over the 
last 20 years. Whilst Brexit and the Covid-19 
pandemic have had short-term impacts on 
migration patterns research suggests that London 
will continue growing over the long-term10.  
Lewisham’s population is forecast to rise by some 
42,400 people or 14 per cent by 204011. 
2.4 Lewisham has a relatively young population. 
One-quarter of residents were less than 20 
years old at the time of the 2011 Census. 
However older people are the fastest growing 
demographic group in London. The number 
and proportion of people aged 65 or more is 
expected to rise sharply over the next decades, 
including in Lewisham12. 2.5 Lewisham is one of the most ethnically diverse 
places in the country. Some 46 per cent of 
residents identify themselves as having Black, 
Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) heritage13.  
This rises to 76 percent for the school 
population14 with more than 170 languages 
spoken by students in the Borough15. The 
electoral roll shows that Lewisham is home to 
residents of 75 nationalities.

32Deprivation and inequality
2.6 Lewisham is a place of stark contrasts in so 
much as it contains areas of wealth as well as 
deprivation, as shown in Figure 2.3 . Whilst 
overall levels of deprivation in Lewisham have 
declined over the past decade it continues to 
rank amongst the 20 per cent most deprived 
local authority areas in the country and is the 
7th most deprived in London16. Child poverty is a 
significant issue with some of the highest levels 
in the country17. 
2.7 Life expectancy at birth for Lewisham male 
residents remains below the national average, 
although for females this now exceeds the 
national average18. There are significant 
differences in life expectancy between the most 
and least deprived wards. Further, research 
points to the disparities in impacts of Covid-19 
on health and wellbeing, with proportionally 
higher risks for BAME groups19 . This data reflects 
the situation of health inequalities across the 
Borough given its population profile.2.8 Physical activity is a key determinant of health 
and wellbeing as obesity is linked to many 
serious risks. More than half of Lewisham’s 
adult population is overweight or obese. Whilst 
the proportion of physically active adults is in 
line with the national average, roughly 16 per 
cent of adults are physically inactive. Childhood 
obesity is also a concern. Some 22 per cent of 
school children in Reception are overweight or 
obese, rising to 38 per cent in Year 6. Children 
living in the Borough’s most deprived areas are 
twice as likely to be obese or overweight as 
other children20.

2.9 The historical growth of Lewisham has led to a 
range of distinctive neighbourhoods served by 
a number of commercial centres, each with its 
own unique character and community. There 
are contrasts between the preindustrial cores 
of Blackheath, Deptford and Lewisham in the 
north of the Borough, the mixed residential 
neighbourhoods surrounding them and the 
interwar growth that characterises much of the 
south of the Borough. Other notable phases of 
development include the building of post-war 
estates along with modern commercial blocks 
and towers.
2.10 Lewisham has a rich and varied historic 
environment. This includes landscapes, river 
corridors, parks and open spaces, buildings 
and structures, urban spaces and the features 
within them, along with archaeological remains 
both buried and above ground. The historic 
environment encapsulates the social and cultural 
history of Lewisham, its communities and people. 
The Borough contains over 600 statutory listed 
buildings, 29 Conservation Areas and the buffer 
zone of the Maritime Greenwich World Heritage 
Site.Housing
2.11 Housing affordability is a critical issue for people 
in Lewisham. Median house prices have risen 
from £99,995 in 2000 to £430,000 in 2020, an 
increase of 330% over 20 years. This exceeds the 
rate of price growth for London during that time. 
When workplace earnings are factored to account 
for relative affordability of housing, Lewisham 
ranks as one of the least affordable boroughs in 
London. The cost of private renting remains lower 
than the London average but prices are rising 
rapidly. Over the period 2010 to 2020 median 
rents rose by 45 per cent, significantly higher 
than the rate for London and England21. 
2.12 There has been a marked change in housing 
tenure. The private rented sector in Lewisham 
is growing, mirroring trends across London. The 
proportion of households with private rents 
increased from 14 per cent in 2001 to around 
23 per cent in 2018. There are also notable 
variations between wards in terms of housing 
tenure mix.

2 LEWISHAM TODAY AND PLANNING AHEADEconomy
2.13 Lewisham’s economy is small and inward looking. 
There are just 40 jobs for every 100 working age 
residents, the second lowest proportion of all 
London boroughs. Local jobs are concentrated in 
public sector activities, such as health care and 
education, along with consumer services. Some 
90 per cent of businesses are small business. 
Prior to the peak of Covid-19 the number of 
new businesses being formed in the Borough 
was rising but much of this was due to structural 
changes in the nature of work with higher levels 
of self-employment and contract work along 
with expansion of the gig economy. The creative 
and digital industries sector is one of the fastest 
growing in London, and Lewisham is now home 
to one of the Capital’s first Creative Enterprise 
Zones22. 2.14 Commercial activity is largely focussed within the 
Borough’s industrial locations and network of 
town centres. A significant amount of industrial 
capacity has been lost in Lewisham in recent 
years, and at a faster rate than the rest of 
London23. There is strong demand for workspace 
in employment areas and vacancy rates are 
low. However the limited supply and rising cost 
of workspace poses a challenge for business 
development24. Town centre vacancy rates 
have increased across the UK during Covid-19, 
rising to an average of 14 per cent. Lewisham’s 
larger town centres have been affected by the 
pandemic as vacancy rates are now slightly 
above the national average25. Covid-19 has also 
accelerated the growth of online shopping and 
this is likely to have implications for town centres, 
particularly the future of traditional bricks and 
mortar retailing.

36Green infrastructure
2.15 Lewisham is well-served by parks, open spaces 
(including waterways) and nature sites, with 
green spaces covering roughly one-fifth of the 
Borough. It ranked first amongst all London 
boroughs in the recent Good Parks for London 
report26. However there are areas within the 
Borough that are deficient in public access to 
open space and nature. There are opportunities 
to improve the quality of open spaces and nature 
sites along with the connections between them. 
Whilst 65 per cent of open spaces have been 
assessed as being of ‘good’ quality, 34 per cent 
are of ‘fair’ quality and 1 per cent ‘poor’27. 
2.16 Natural capital accounting assesses the 
environmental, social and economic value of 
green infrastructure. Research indicates that 
Lewisham accrues benefits of up to £2.1 billion 
from its network of green infrastructure28.

2 LEWISHAM TODAY AND PLANNING AHEADEnvironment
2.17 There is substantial evidence that climate 
change as a result of human activity is linked 
to increasing frequency and intensity of 
extreme weather events. It is broadly accepted 
as one of the key challenges now facing the 
world. Carbon emissions are a key contributory 
factor. In Lewisham they have fallen 38 per 
cent since 200529. However action is required 
to further reduce emissions and achieve net 
carbon neutrality. Half of the Borough’s carbon 
emissions come from energy used within homes 
with the remaining half split between transport 
and business30. 
2.18 Lewisham’s neighbourhoods and communities 
must be made more resilient to the effects of 
climate change, such as heat and flood risk. The 
Borough’s position alongside the River Thames 
and within the Ravensbourne catchment puts 
people and properties at risk of flooding. As well, 
large parts of the Borough are prone to surface 
water flooding owing to their heavily urbanised 
nature.2.19 Air quality is a significant public health 
issue across London. There are 6 Air Quality 
Management Areas in Lewisham, including 
two major areas, which have been declared for 
several pollutants. The highest concentrations 
of nitrogen/nitric oxides (NOx), NO² and 
Particulate Matter (PM) which currently breach 
the legal limits are found on the busiest main 
roads31. London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone 
(ULEZ) was recently extended to cover parts of 
Lewisham, up to the South Circular (A205 road).

38Transport and connectivity
2.20 Despite Lewisham’s inner-London location not all 
of its areas are well-connected or benefit from 
good access to public transport. The northern 
and central neighbourhoods are generally better 
connected to the rest of London with access to 
the Overground, Docklands Light Rail (DLR) 
and mainline trains. Public transport access 
is comparatively poorer in parts of Deptford 
and neighbourhoods in the south east. This 
contributes to a relatively high proportion of 
daily trips being made by car and motorcycle. 
There is no direct access to the Underground in 
Lewisham. However the London Plan commits to 
the delivery of the Bakerloo line extension, which 
will take it along Old Kent Road to New Cross 
Gate and beyond.
2.21 Cycling in Lewisham, and London on whole, has 
shown continued growth over the past decade. 
The number of daily trips made by cycle in the 
Borough is rising. However research indicates 
that only 7 per cent of ‘potentially cyclable’ 
trips in Lewisham are being made by cycle. Road 
safety is also an area of concern32.

3.1 The Local Plan is focussed on realising the ‘Vision for Lewisham’:
3.2 Lewisham will continue to be a welcoming place where the culture and diversity of our 
people, and the unique qualities of local neighbourhoods, is recognised and protected. 
We will always celebrate what makes us different and have a strong sense of 
community. We will give people the security and certainty they need so that everyone 
can live their best lives.  
 
Lewisham will be a place where all generations not only live but also thrive. A place 
that people want to visit and live in, and where they choose to stay and enjoy a good 
quality of life. A place where you can get on, regardless of your background and 
where you are always treated fairly and are supported to achieve your full potential.  
 
Lewisham will continue to be a dynamic place, reflecting the strength of its 
communities, and partnership working with our community remains at our core. 
We are proud of the vibrancy of our high streets, local businesses, arts and cultural 
establishments, our evening and night-time economy and our world renowned 
institutions. We will not only protect them but grow them. We will contribute to and 
share in more of London’s future prosperity, becoming a greener, healthier and more 
resilient place by leading the way in responding to the global climate emergency.  
 
Most of all, we want you to love living in Lewisham.

42Strategic objectives
3.3 The strategic objectives form a link between the 
Vision for Lewisham and the spatial strategy. 
They address the key challenges facing the 
Borough now and over the long-term, and 
represent the main delivery outcomes sought 
through the implementation of the Local Plan.
3.4 The strategic objectives have been informed by 
and reflect many of the key documents prepared 
by the Council, including the Corporate Strategy 
2018-2022, along with those published by our 
partners and other key stakeholders.
3.5 An overarching objective for “An Open Lewisham 
as part of an Open London” helps to frame the 
strategic objectives, which are presented across 
nine themed topic areas. The objectives have 
been set out this way for organisational purposes 
and are not listed in order of priority. Many of 
the individual objectives are crosscutting in that 
they address more than one of the topic areas.

48OL1 Delivering an Open Lewisham (spatial strategy)
A The Council will work positively and alongside 
local communities, community groups, and 
other public and private sector stakeholders to 
realise the Vision for Lewisham and to address 
the strategic objective for ‘An Open Lewisham 
as part of an Open London’. Good Growth will 
be delivered in the Borough by:
a. Directing new development to Growth 
Nodes, Regeneration Nodes and well-
connected sites, including in Lewisham’s 
Opportunity Areas of New Cross/
Lewisham/Catford and Deptford Creek/
Greenwich Riverside, and carefully 
managing growth in these locations in 
response to local character;
b. Directing new development and investment 
to the Borough’s strategic Area for 
Regeneration, and other local areas for 
regeneration, and coordinating the delivery 
of this investment to help tackle the 
environmental, social and economic barriers 
that affect the lives of people in these 
areas, and ensure equality of opportunity;
c. Directing new residential, commercial, 
community, leisure and cultural 
development to Lewisham’s town and local 
centres in order to support their vibrancy, 
vitality, viability and long-term resilience, 
and through this process:
i. Enable Lewisham Major Centre to cement 
its position as a centre of sub-regional 
significance and be designated as a 
Metropolitan Centre in a future review of 
the London Plan;ii. Facilitate the comprehensive regeneration 
of Catford Major Centre to reinforce its 
role as the principal civic and cultural hub 
within the Borough; and
iii. Ensure the District Centres at Blackheath, 
Deptford, Downham, Forest Hill, Lee 
Green, New Cross and Sydenham 
retain their distinctive -character whilst 
evolving in their function as key hubs 
of community, cultural and commercial 
activity;  
d. Directing new development along the 
A21 Corridor and other strategic Growth 
Corridors to support growth, along with 
using the Healthy Streets Approach 
to enhance the quality of places and 
improve connections within and between  
neighbourhoods;
e. Securing the delivery of new and improved 
infrastructure as a catalyst for investment 
and to unlock the development potential 
of sites across the Borough.  The delivery 
of the Bakerloo line extension will both 
support and enable growth in Opportunity 
Areas and Lewisham’s southern areas, 
including Bell Green and Lower Sydenham;
f. Making the best use of land and space by 
prioritising the redevelopment of brownfield 
land of low or negligible ecological value 
and enabling the sensitive intensification of 
established residential neighbourhoods and 
commercial areas, including through the 
development of small sites;

3 VISION, STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND THE SPATIAL STRATEGYg. Ensuring all new development proposals 
follow the design-led approach to make the 
optimal use of land, respond positively to 
local distinctiveness (including the historic, 
cultural, natural and built environment), 
and helps to secure inclusive, safe, liveable, 
walkable and healthy neighbourhoods;
h. Protecting, enhancing and connecting 
Lewisham’s network of green infrastructure 
(including trees, parks and open spaces, 
water spaces and biodiversity), as well as 
improving the population’s access to it by 
walking and cycling; 
i. Ensuring that a strategic and coordinated 
approach is taken by the Council and 
its partners to respond to the climate 
emergency and requiring new development 
to integrate measures for climate change 
adaptation and mitigation.
50Explanation
3.6 This is the overarching policy for the Local 
Plan and is the starting point for achieving the 
Vision for Lewisham and responding to the 
plan’s strategic objectives. It sets out the spatial 
strategy for the Borough. This is the land use 
and planning framework for the Council and its 
partners to manage growth and development, as 
well as to guide new investment up to 2040.  The 
policy provides a key link between the Local Plan 
and the London Plan. It will help to ensure that 
Good Growth is delivered in a way that responds 
to Lewisham’s distinctiveness. 
Opportunity Areas 
3.7 The London Plan identifies two Opportunity 
Areas within Lewisham. These are the New 
Cross/Lewisham/Catford corridor and the 
area at Deptford Creek/Greenwich Riverside. 
Opportunity Areas are “significant locations 
with development capacity to accommodate 
new housing, commercial development and infrastructure (of all types), linked to existing 
or potential improvements in public transport 
connectivity and capacity”33. The London Plan 
requires the Local Plan to set a strategy for 
facilitating growth and regeneration within 
these areas and maximising their development 
potential.  
3.8 In recent years there has been a significant 
amount of new development and investment 
within Lewisham’s Opportunity Areas. A number 
of large brownfield sites have now been 
redeveloped or are expected to come forward 
soon, with planning consent granted and/or 
construction started. These new developments 
have already delivered, or are committed to 
provide, many more new homes including 
affordable housing, modern workspace and 
community facilities, along with new and 
improved transport infrastructure, open space 
and other public realm enhancements.

3 VISION, STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND THE SPATIAL STRATEGY3.9 There remain significant opportunities for 
growth and regeneration within the New Cross/
Lewisham/Catford Opportunity Area. New 
development will be facilitated through the 
consolidation and intensification of underused 
and vacant industrial sites, the revitalisation 
and renewal of larger town centres, particularly 
Lewisham and Catford Major Centres, and the 
intensification of land along key movement 
corridors such as the A21 and A2 Growth 
Corridors. Growth and regeneration will be aided 
by the delivery of new and improved transport 
infrastructure, which will help to unlock the 
development potential of sites. This includes 
the arrival of the Bakerloo line extension at New 
Cross Gate linking to Lewisham town centre 
with a modernised station interchange. The re-
routing of the South Circular (A205) at Catford 
will enable the regeneration and transformation 
of the Major Centre. The Council has prepared 
guidance documents for the Opportunity Area 
which have both informed the Local Plan and will 
support its implementation. These include the 
New Cross Area Framework, A21 Development 
Framework, Catford Town Centre Framework and 
the Surrey Canal Triangle SPD.
3.10 The Deptford Creek/Greenwich Riverside 
Opportunity Area will also be a focus for 
growth and regeneration, building on the area’s 
distinctive character and strong relationship with 
the waterway network. New development will 
be facilitated mainly through the consolidation 
and intensification of employment sites. This 
will enable the delivery of new employment-led, 
mixed use development and transformational 
public realm enhancements. The scale of growth 
and design of development will be carefully 
managed in order to ensure the area’s maritime and industrial heritage is preserved, enhanced 
and better revealed. The wider area benefits from 
the presence of world renowned educational and 
cultural institutions, which will provide a focus for 
community activity with linkages to the Deptford 
Creekside and New Cross Cultural Quarters as 
well as the historic High Streets of Deptford and 
New Cross.
Tackling deprivation and ensuring equality 
of opportunity
3.11 It is vitally important that everyone is able to 
enjoy a good quality of life irrespective of their 
background, age or ability. Whilst there are many 
prosperous neighbourhoods in Lewisham there 
are some localities where environmental, social 
and economic barriers adversely affect peoples’ 
lives. Some of these localities are within the 20 
per cent most deprived in the country. The Local 
Plan seeks to tackle deprivation by coordinating 
new investment within these areas. It also 
highlights for our stakeholders and delivery The Green Man community building
52partners the need for targeted interventions to 
address the specific causes of deprivation and 
inequality. This includes investment in the built 
and natural environment as well as programmes 
for education, training, health and social care. 
Deprivation is most prevalent in Opportunity 
Areas, the Strategic Area for Regeneration and 
Regeneration Nodes.
Thriving and resilient town centres
3.12 The Local Plan seeks to ensure that Lewisham 
features a well-connected network of thriving 
and resilient town centres. The spatial strategy 
directs new development to town centres and 
their surrounds. It supports the ‘15-minute 
neighbourhood’ concept, where centres provide 
people with most of their needs within a short 
walk or cycle journey from their home. This 
pattern of development is advocated to facilitate 
and better balance growth as well as to redress 
the distribution of investment locally, ultimately, 
to make neighbourhoods more sustainable and 
ensure equality of opportunity across Lewisham. 
3.13 The Borough’s town centres tend to have 
higher  Public Transport Access Levels 
along with a concentration of services and 
community facilities, making them well-placed 
to accommodate more people and activities. 
New development can support town centre 
vitality particularly where larger schemes deliver 
public realm and townscape improvements. 
There are also opportunities to secure the 
long-term viability of town centres through the 
introduction of a wider range of uses including 
housing, workspace, cultural uses and community 
facilities.3.14 It is imperative that town centres complement 
and support but do not compete with one 
another. Therefore, the Local Plan seeks to 
build on the unique attributes, character and 
function of each of the Borough’s town and 
local centres. As these centres will be key focal 
points for growth and new development they are 
expected to evolve over time, responding to the 
challenges facing our high streets and becoming 
even more liveable, vibrant and resilient places. 
Further details about the character and role of 
Lewisham’s town and local centres, along with 
parameters for development within and around 
town them, are set out in Part 2 and Part 3 of 
the Local Plan.

54 Growth Corridors
3.15 The delivery of Good Growth will require that 
people are enabled to live car-free lifestyles 
and travel mainly by walking, cycling and public 
transport. To make this happen Lewisham will need 
to be supported by an excellent public transport 
system along with a network of high quality 
walking routes and cycleways. Good connections 
to and between town centres, parks and green 
spaces and residential areas are integral to liveable 
neighbourhoods. Also, the long-term viability of 
Lewisham’s town centres and other employment 
locations will rely heavily on their capability to be 
accessed safely and easily by all.
3.16 The Opportunity Areas define a central growth 
corridor in Lewisham. This covers Deptford and 
extends south taking in the town centres at New 
Cross, Lewisham and Catford. The A21 road 
(Lewisham High Street, Rushey Green and Bromley 
Road) is the principal north-south route within this 
corridor. Elsewhere there are several major roads 
including the A20 (an historic east-west route 
from central London to Kent and the south east); 
the A205 South Circular (an orbital route from 
Woolwich to Chiswick, traversing Lee, Catford and 
Forest Hill); and the A212 (which links the South 
Circular to Croydon). It is acknowledged that some 
Growth Corridors include Conservation Areas and 
other heritage assets, or fall within their setting, 
and therefore growth will need to be carefully 
managed in a way that responds positively to local 
historic character.3.17 These main roads currently prioritise vehicular 
movement. They are car-dominated, often suffer 
from congestion and adversely impact on local 
amenity, for example, by contributing to noise and 
air pollution. The major roads and their surrounds 
can be transformed into safer, healthier and more 
attractive places by using the Healthy Streets 
Approach. To achieve this it will be necessary 
to rebalance the ‘link’ function of the roads, 
giving priority to movement by foot, cycle and 
public transport, and also enhancing their ‘place’ 
qualities. Investment within the growth corridors 
will be necessary deliver Healthy Streets. The Local 
Plan therefore directs new development along the 
main roads and supports the intensification of 
sites along them. Part 3 of the Local Plan includes 
site allocations where new development will be 
required to deliver public realm and other area 
enhancements. The A21 Development Framework 
and New Cross Area Framework will support the 
implementation of this policy. 
Securing infrastructure to support our 
neighbourhoods and communities
3.18 It is imperative that everyone in Lewisham is 
able to share in the opportunities and benefits 
that growth and regeneration bring. The Council 
will continue to work with its key stakeholders 
and development industry partners to deliver 
the infrastructure Lewisham’s neighbourhoods 
and communities need. We have prepared an 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) which will be 
used to inform planning and investment decisions. 
This will help us to secure infrastructure where and 
when it is needed. Further details are set out in 
Part 4 of the Local Plan..

3 VISION, STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND THE SPATIAL STRATEGY3.19 Despite being an inner-London borough some 
parts of Lewisham are poorly served by public 
transport. This is a key factor influencing the 
deprivation experienced by people in the 
Borough. We have prepared “A Vision for Rail”34 
which sets out our priorities to address gaps in 
transport provision, and to ensure Lewisham is 
able to appropriately support London’s growth.
3.20 The London Plan commits to extend the Bakerloo 
line on the Underground (tube) from Elephant 
and Castle to Lewisham via Old Kent Road and 
New Cross Gate. This would enable a potential 
further southward extension beyond Lewisham, 
although the route selection for the second 
phase of the BLE remains at an early stage and 
is subject to further development and public 
consultation by Transport for London. On 1st 
March 2021 the Secretary of State for Transport 
issued safeguarding Directions for the Bakerloo 
line extension (BLE)35.  
3.21 The BLE is essential to supporting London’s 
growth, and will help to facilitate the delivery 
of many more new homes and jobs in the New 
Cross/Lewisham/Catford Opportunity Area. The 
potential further extension of the Bakerloo line 
will also support transformational investment and 
growth in the Bell Green and Lower Sydenham 
area and ensure the capacity of sites is optimised. 
The Council envisages a future London Plan 
Opportunity Area here, linked to the BLE, and 
we will continue to work with the Mayor of London on planning for this part of the Borough.  
The Local Plan sets a framework to secure the 
delivery of the BLE and to maximise its potential 
in supporting Good Growth and generating new 
inward investment. However, as full funding for 
the project has not yet been secured a pragmatic 
approach is necessary. The spatial strategy is 
therefore not dependent on the BLE and can be 
achieved in its absence. At the same time, the 
Local Plan policies provide flexibility to respond to 
the phased delivery of the BLE over the medium to 
long-term. 
Making the best the use of land and space
3.22 Lewisham will continue to play a role in 
accommodating London’s future growth. Whilst 
growth will bring many opportunities and new 
investment it will also lead to increasing and 
competing pressure on the use of land. In response 
to this the Local Plan sets a framework to help 
ensure that the best use is made of the Borough’s 
limited supply of land. The spatial strategy directs 
higher density and mixed-use development to 
well-connected locations and other areas where 
new investment will support regeneration. It is 
complemented by the Part 2 policies which set 
requirements to ensure that new development is 
designed to a high quality standard and makes 
the optimal use of land. For example, by making 
provision for the co-location of uses or designing 
buildings and spaces which are adaptable to the 
needs of different activities and users.
34 Lewisham Council - A Vision for Rail (2017)
35 The Direction relates to the extension proposed to be 
constructed to the Bakerloo line to Lewisham via Old Kent 
Road and New Cross Gate. It should be referred for further 
information on the extent of Areas of ‘Surface Interest’ 
and ‘Areas of Subsurface Interest’.
563.23 The spatial strategy prioritises the redevelopment 
of brownfield land, or previously developed land 
of low or negligible ecological value. This will 
ensure that Lewisham’s green and open spaces 
are protected and opportunities are taken to 
enhance the ecological value of brownfield sites. 
Part 3 of the Local Plan includes site allocation 
policies to ensure that the best use of land and 
optimal capacity of sites is realised. These are 
mainly located within the Opportunity Areas, 
Growth Nodes, Regeneration Nodes, town centres 
and along strategic corridors. Elsewhere, the 
sensitive intensification of established residential 
neighbourhoods and commercial areas will be 
supported. This will be enabled by mainly by the 
redevelopment of small sites.
Celebrating Lewisham’s diversity and 
enhancing its distinctiveness
3.24 The Local Plan requires all new development to 
be delivered through a design-led approach. This 
means that new development must be based on 
an understanding of the site context and respond 
positively to the Borough’s local distinctiveness. 
The use of the design-led approach will help to 
ensure that the unique and valued features of our 
neighbourhoods remain at the heart of the spatial 
strategy, and are fully considered in planning 
decisions.
3.25 Lewisham has been shaped by its historical 
development. It will continue to evolve in the 
context of London’s growth and new technological 
advances. Respecting local character and 
accommodating growth should not be seen as 
mutually exclusive. New development must help 
to reinforce the special characteristics of the 
Borough. At the same time, it should assist in 
repairing and re-shaping those elements of the built environment that could make a more positive 
contribution to the visual quality and liveability of 
our neighbourhoods. 
A greener, more resilient borough 
3.26 The Council is committed to promoting and 
securing sustainable development. We have 
declared a climate emergency and prepared a 
Climate Emergency Action Plan which will work 
in tandem with the Local Plan36. Sustainable 
development means development that meets 
the needs of the present without compromising 
the ability of future generations to meet their 
own needs37. Environmental stewardship is an 
integral part of this. London’s natural assets are an 
irreplaceable resource and need to be conserved 
and protected. However, they are coming under 
increasing pressure from human activity, including 
that which is contributing to global climate 
change.
3.27 The Local Plan sets a framework for managing 
Good Growth with environmental considerations 
fully integrated into the planning and development 
process. It sets out our approach to protecting 
and enhancing the local network of green 
infrastructure, parks and open spaces and the 
water environment. As well, it provides the local 
land-use strategy for mitigating the Borough’s 
impact on global climate change, whilst ensuring 
neighbourhoods are made more resilient and well 
placed to adapt to the consequences of it. Part 
2 and Part 3 of the Local Plan set out further 
detailed requirements for new developments.

Using the design-led approach
A Development proposals must follow a design-
led approach to contribute to delivering high 
quality, inclusive, safe, healthy, liveable and 
sustainable neighbourhoods in Lewisham. This 
requires the consideration of design options 
at the early stage of the development process 
informed by an understanding of the site and 
its local context, including through effective 
engagement with the local community. 
These design options should then be used 
to determine the most appropriate form of 
development that responds positively to the 
local context, along with the optimal use of 
land to support the delivery of the spatial 
strategy for the Borough.
Distinctive and valued places
B Development proposals must demonstrate an 
understanding of the site context and respond 
positively to Lewisham’s local distinctiveness 
by providing for buildings, spaces and places 
that reinforce and enhance local character. 
This includes the special and distinctive visual, 
historical, environmental, social and functional 
qualities of places that contribute to local 
character, identity, sense of community and 
belonging.  
C To successfully respond to local distinctiveness 
development proposals must be designed to 
address:
a. Natural features including trees, landscape, 
topography, open spaces and waterways;b. The prevailing or emerging form of 
development (including urban grain, 
building typology, morphology and the 
hierarchy of streets, routes and other 
spaces);
c. The proportion of development (including 
height, scale, mass and bulk) within the site, 
its immediate vicinity and the surrounding 
area;
d. Building lines along with the orientation of 
and spacing between buildings;
e. Strategic and local views, vistas and 
landmarks;
f. Townscape features;
g. The significance of heritage assets and their 
setting; 
h. Architectural styles, detailing and materials 
that contribute to local character; and
i. Cultural assets.
Places for people
D Development proposals must put people 
at the centre of the design-led approach, 
ensuring buildings and spaces are welcoming, 
inclusive, safe and accessible to people of all 
backgrounds, ages and abilities. Development 
should be designed and built to a human scale 
by responding to the ways in which people 
move through, engage with and experience 
their surroundings.

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNE Development proposals must be designed to 
facilitate good physical and mental health, 
support the wellbeing of the population and 
foster community cohesion by providing:
a. Buildings and spaces that are inclusive, 
intuitive to use, comfortable, safe and secure;
b. A high quality public realm that maintains 
and wherever possible enhances access to 
green and open spaces;
c. Positive and active frontages that generate 
visual interest and which have a positive 
relationship with the public realm, particularly 
at the street-level;
d. Well-integrated, dedicated space and 
equipment for relaxation, social interaction 
and physical activity, including where 
appropriate space for play and informal 
recreation; and
e. A high standard of amenity.
Well-functioning and resilient places
F Development proposals must be well-integrated 
within their neighbourhood. They must provide 
a positive and coherent relationship with all 
land uses and spaces within the site and its 
surroundings having r4egard to:
a. The compatibility of land-uses and activities 
within and surrounding the development;
b. The need to ensure that neighbourhoods are 
well-connected both by encouraging and 
enabling movement by walking, cycling and 
the use of public transport; and
c. The efficient servicing and effective 
management of buildings and the public 
realm, including for delivery and servicing 
vehicles.G Development must be appropriately supported 
by infrastructure. Development proposals 
will be expected to consider, and be linked 
to, the provision of future planned levels of 
infrastructure along with the timing of the 
delivery of this infrastructure. Where there is 
insufficient capacity of existing infrastructure 
to support a development proposal, applicants 
will be required to work with infrastructure 
providers to ensure sufficient capacity will exist 
at the appropriate time, including through the 
phasing of development.
H Development proposals must be designed 
to mitigate climate change and integrate 
adaptation measures to make neighbourhoods 
and properties more resilient to its impacts, 
including by maximising opportunities for 
urban greening, with reference to other Local 
Plan policies. 
Delivering high quality development
I Development proposals must include a Design 
and Access Statement to demonstrate how 
the design-led approach has been applied to 
deliver high quality development.
J Development proposals will be expected to 
have regard to and address:
a. Supplementary Planning Documents and 
Guidance published by the Council and the 
Mayor of London respectively, along with 
other good practice guidance; and
b. Feedback from the Council including 
through its Pre-application Advice Service 
and where appropriate, Lewisham’s 
independent Design Review Panel.
68K Applicants should work closely with local 
communities and others likely to be affected 
by new development to understand the local 
and distinctive context of the site, as well as to 
consider design options that respond positively 
to this context. Development proposals that 
can demonstrate early, proactive, inclusive 
and effective engagement with the local 
community and other key stakeholders will be 
considered more favourably than those that 
cannot.

70Explanation
5.1 To realise the Vision for Lewisham and address 
the Local Plan’s strategic objectives it is 
imperative that all new development is designed, 
built and managed to a high quality standard, 
using the design-led approach. 
5.2 The design-led approach requires that, from the 
very start of the planning and design process, 
careful consideration is given to the distinctive 
features of Lewisham’s neighbourhoods, 
buildings and other spaces that shape local 
character and contribute positively to people’s 
sense of place and belonging. It also requires 
new development to respond to the ways in 
which people use and experience buildings 
and spaces, along with the impacts the built 
environment has on the health and wellbeing of 
the population. Finally, the design-led approach 
requires development to function effectively both 
on its own and in relation to the buildings and 
spaces around it. 
5.3 The design-led approach must begin with an 
understanding of the development site’s local 
context. This includes the distinctive character 
of the site and its wider setting. The Lewisham 
Characterisation Study (2019) has informed the 
preparation of the Local Plan and will support 
its implementation. It should be referred to as a 
useful starting point for development proposals 
as it provides insight into the key features 
of the Borough’s historical, built and natural 
environment. This is only one point of reference, however, and proposals will be expected to 
demonstrate a comprehensive understanding 
of the site context and clearly articulate how 
the development has been designed to respond 
positively to this. This includes consideration 
of the evolving character of an area and 
opportunities to carefully manage change in a 
way that supports Good Growth. Development 
proposals should therefore address their 
relationship to the spatial strategy, site 
allocations and where relevant, development 
which has been consented but not yet 
unimplemented.
5.4 The successful delivery of the spatial strategy 
will require that new developments optimise 
the capacity of sites. There is a need to 
accommodate a significant amount of growth 
within the Borough over the plan period, which 
must be carefully managed. The design-led 
approach is integral to ensuring that the optimal 
capacity of development sites is realised. 
Further details are set out in Policy QD6 
(Optimising site capacity).

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNDelivering high quality development
5.5 We will publish a package of planning guidance 
to support implementation of the Local Plan, 
and to ensure clarity in our expectations for 
new development. Key guidance documents 
are signposted throughout the Local Plan. They 
should be read in conjunction with the suite of 
London Plan Supplementary Planning Guidance 
and other sources of good practice guidance, 
where appropriate, including the Government’s 
National Design Guide and that published by 
Historic England. 
5.6 Pre-application meetings are a useful way to 
establish the land use principles for development 
sites, and to identify and discuss any key matters 
that need to be addressed within a particular 
scheme. This includes the consideration of routes 
to resolving planning issues or other potential 
conflicts prior to the formal submission of a 
planning application.  Pre-application meetings 
are also useful information sharing exercises, and 
provide the Council with opportunities to support 
development industry partners in linking up 
with other corporate services and service areas. 
For instance, we can flag resources available to 
help with sourcing local labour for construction 
projects, including apprenticeships, as well as 
funding opportunities to boost the delivery of 
genuinely affordable housing.  5.7 We are proud to support an independent Design 
Review Panel (DRP) in Lewisham as part of 
our positive approach to working with delivery 
partners. The DRP is formed of professional 
design experts who meet regularly to review 
schemes and provide feedback to applicants. 
While the panel does not have decision-making 
powers, it serves as an advisory body helping 
to achieve positive outcomes for the built 
environment and Lewisham’s communities. 
Comments from the panel are fed into the 
assessment of pre-application schemes, planning 
applications and appeals. Proposals for major 
developments and other developments likely to 
have significant local impacts should be brought 
to the panel at the early stage in the planning 
process. Further information about the DRP is 
available on the Council’s planning webpage.
725.8 Applicants should work closely with local 
communities and others likely to be affected 
by new development to understand the local 
and distinctive context of the site and its 
setting, as well as to consider design options 
that respond positively to this context. 
Community consensus and agreement on 
proposals is not in itself a reason for granting 
planning consent, as all proposals will need to 
demonstrate compliance with the Local Plan 
policies. However applicants working with the 
community through the design-led approach are 
more likely to arrive at development proposals 
that respond to the distinctive qualities of 
neighbourhoods and places, based on a more 
thorough understanding of the local context, 
and therefore support the delivery of the 
spatial strategy. Development proposals that 
can demonstrate early, proactive, inclusive and 
effective engagement with the local community 
and other key stakeholders will be considered 
more favourably than those that cannot.

A It is imperative that people of all backgrounds, 
ages and abilities are able to move with ease 
throughout Borough, and within buildings 
and spaces, as well as to feel safe in their 
surroundings wherever they are. Development 
proposals must include an Inclusive Design 
Statement to demonstrate how they will 
contribute to delivering inclusive, accessible, 
safe and secure environments in Lewisham.
B Development proposals must respond 
positively to the diversity and varied needs 
of Lewisham’s population and promote social 
cohesion by:
a. Ensuring buildings and spaces are designed 
to be entered, used and exited safely, easily 
and with dignity for all;
b. Ensuring buildings and spaces are designed 
to be inclusive to all with no disabling 
barriers that inhibit, restrict or prevent 
convenient access and use, including by 
occupants of different tenure types; 
c. Incorporating measures that allow for easy 
adaptation of buildings and spaces to help 
meet the different and changing needs of 
users over the lifetime of the development;
d. Delivering a high quality public realm, in 
line with Policy QD3 (Public realm and 
connecting places); and
e. Applying ‘Secured by Design’ principles.
C Where development proposals incorporate 
perimeter or external gates, the use of these 
must be justified for reasons of public health 
and safety. Where gates are considered by 
the Council to be acceptable in principle, 
these must be of a high quality design and 
sensitively integrated into the development. Planning contributions and/or legal agreements 
may be used to secure the appropriate 
management of gates, and to help ensure they 
do not unnecessarily restrict public access to 
buildings and spaces, including the public realm.
Accessible and inclusive housing
D To help ensure that housing is designed to meet 
the varied requirements of Lewisham’s resident 
population development proposals  incorporating 
new residential units must ensure that:
a. At least 10 per cent of dwellings meet 
Building Regulation requirement M4(3) 
‘wheelchair user dwellings’; and
b. All other dwellings meet Building Regulation 
requirement M4(2) ‘accessible and adaptable 
dwellings’.
E Development proposals for housing must be 
designed to maximise tenure integration and be 
‘tenure neutral’, having regard to the National 
Design Guide or latest equivalent. 
F Where development proposals for housing 
include provision of communal private amenity 
space or facilities this should be designed and 
appropriately managed in a way that allows 
for access by all residents occupying the 
development, regardless of tenure.
Adapting historic buildings and other heritage 
assets
G Where adaptations to an historic building or 
other heritage asset is proposed to make the 
building or space more inclusive and safe, 
development proposals will be supported where 
they preserve or enhance the significance of the 
asset and its setting.

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNExplanation
5.9 The built environment influences the quality of 
life of everyone in Lewisham. The layout and 
design of buildings and spaces can significantly 
impact on people’s ability to move with ease 
around the Borough and to live independent 
and dignified lives. Development proposals must 
therefore apply inclusive and safe design principles 
using the design-led approach. This will need to 
be demonstrated through an Inclusive Design 
Statement, submitted as part of the Design and 
Access Statement.
5.10 Whilst inclusive design includes consideration of 
wheelchair users it is important to emphasise that 
it extends beyond this particular group. Inclusive 
design must consider the needs of the wider 
population and the different groups of people that 
are likely to access and use buildings and spaces, 
including the public realm. 
5.11 Development proposals should take into account 
and respond positively to the diverse needs of 
Lewisham’s population, including families and 
those in groups with protected characteristics38. 
Wherever possible buildings and spaces should 
be designed to be adaptable to the different 
and changing needs of users over the lifetime 
of development. This will help to avoid or offset 
costly alterations that may be required later on. 
Applicants are encouraged to refer the latest 
standing guidance on inclusive design, including 
British Standards documents BS8300-1:2018 
(Design of an accessible and inclusive built 
environment. External environment. Code of Practice. January 2018) and BS8300-2:2028 
(Design of an accessible and inclusive built 
environment. Buildings. Code of Practice. 
January 2018).
5.12 Development proposals should use the latest 
standing guidance on ‘Secured by Design’39, or 
equivalent guidance, to help reduce crime and 
improve perceptions of safety. This includes 
measures to encourage passive surveillance, 
including through the integration of active 
frontages and layouts which allow for ‘eyes 
on the street’.. Developments should make 
provision for easily accessible, legible and 
appropriately illuminated access and entrance 
points, including the public realm. By applying 
38 Groups with protected characteristics are set out in the 
Equalities Act 2010.39 Secured by Design is the official police security 
initiative that works to improve the security of buildings 
and their immediate surroundings to provide safe places.Margaret McMillan Park
76Secure by Design principles development 
proposals can help to create safer public spaces, 
particularly children and young people40 and 
other groups, such as women and girls41, for 
whom the design of the built environment can 
have significant impacts on personal security and 
perceptions of safety.
Accessible and inclusive housing
5.13 In line with the London Plan, development 
proposals must contribute to the strategic target 
for provision of wheelchair user dwellings and 
ensuring accessible and adaptable dwellings, 
in accordance with Building Regulations M4(3) 
and M4(2) respectively, or equivalent standards 
which may supersede these. For the avoidance 
of doubt, this policy applies to dwellings that are 
created via works to which Part M volume 1 of 
the Building Regulations applies. To comply with 
the Building Regulation requirements appropriate 
step-free access into the dwelling will need to 
be provided. This policy helps to support our 
approach to meeting housing needs for older 
people through adaptable housing
5.14 All housing development should meet the 
London Plan target for M4(2) dwellings. Major 
developments should also meet the M4(3) target 
on-site, whilst minor developments of less than 
10 units will be required to provide sufficient 
justification if the target for ‘wheelchair user’ 
dwellings cannot be met. In considering the 
suitability of a site for wheelchair accessible and 
adaptable or user dwellings we will have regard to individual site circumstances. This is because 
flexibility may need to be applied to meet policy 
objectives (e.g. to enable the requirement to 
apply to 10 per cent of habitable rooms where a 
better outcome is provided in terms of provision 
of larger units). Discretion may also be needed in 
exceptional circumstances when provision of a lift 
to dwelling entrances is not technically feasible, 
such as with some constrained infill sites or flats 
above shops. Planning conditions may be used to 
secure an appropriate amount of provision M4(2) 
and M4(3) standard dwellings.
5.15 All development should be designed to promote 
social integration, community cohesion and 
equality of access. This includes inclusive, safe 
and welcoming access to buildings, particularly 
front entrances and amenity spaces. Proposals 
should avoid the use of separate main entrances 
and external or perimeter gates. 
5.16 Development proposals for new housing must 
be designed to maximise tenure integration and 
be ‘tenure neutral’. The National Design Guide 
(2021) defines tenure neutral as: “Housing 
where no group of residents is disadvantaged 
as a result of the tenure of their homes. There is 
no segregation or difference in quality between 
tenures by siting, accessibility, environmental 
conditions, external facade or materials. 
Homes of all tenures are represented in equally 
attractive and beneficial locations, and there is 
no differentiation in the positions of entrances. 
40   The Local Plan supports priorities of the Lewisham 
Children and Young People’s Plan 2019-2022.
41   There is a growing body of evidence linking urban design 
to women’s safety and perceptions of safety. For example, 
research prepared and collated by the UN Women National 
Committee UK.

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNShared open or play spaces are accessible to all 
residents around them, regardless of tenure”. 
Development proposals will be assessed having 
regard to the National Design Guide, or latest 
equivalent. Applications should clearly set 
out details of their approach to tenure neutral 
housing in the Inclusive Design Statement.
5.17 Where private communal amenity space is 
provided in new housing development this must 
be designed and appropriately managed in a way 
that allows for access to all residents occupying 
the building. Details of access, management 
and building maintenance should be included 
with planning applications, normally in the form 
of Management Plans. These should clearly set 
out why any proposed measures to manage 
access are considered necessary in the interests 
of public health and safety. They should also 
address site specific issues, for example, where 
larger developments and sites contain many 
blocks or uses that are owned and/or managed 
by different parties, and where individual security 
and management requirements are needed. 
We will refuse proposals that unnecessarily 
restrict, inhibit or prevent access to buildings or 
communal amenity space, including for reasons 
of housing tenure. Adapting historic buildings and other 
heritage assets
5.18 Non-standard approaches may be required when 
adapting historic buildings and other heritage 
assets, and current design standards should 
be considered flexibly alongside the particular 
heritage significance of a building or asset. We 
will work with applicants to help ensure that 
any alterations or changes proposed to make 
heritage assets safer and more inclusive do not 
harm their significance, in line with the NPPF 
and Local Plan policies in Section 6 (Heritage). 
Where historic buildings, spaces or other features 
are likely to be affected by development, careful 
consideration will need to be given to ensure 
that new design responds sensitively to its 
context, and does not adversely impact on those 
elements that contribute to the significance 
of the asset. Applicants are advised to consult 
relevant guidance on this matter for support, 
including the latest standing guidance published 
by Historic England.

A Development proposals must use the design-
led approach to secure a high quality public 
realm. They must respond positively to the 
role of the public realm in contributing 
to local distinctiveness and supporting 
inclusive, safe, accessible, attractive and well-
connected places and spaces. 
B Development proposals must respond 
positively to the movement and connective 
function of the public realm. They should 
be designed to enable and encourage 
movement by walking, cycling and the 
use of public transport, and also seek to 
reduce vehicular dominance and speeds. 
Proposals must ensure that the public 
realm provide for coherent relationships 
with surrounding buildings and land-uses, 
and good connections within and between 
neighbourhoods. 
C Development proposals must address 
legibility and permeability of the public realm, 
both within a site as well as its immediate and 
wider surroundings, taking account of the 
movement patterns and desire lines of people 
within an area. Consideration should be given 
to the location of street crossings and other 
measures to promote safe access for all, such 
as way-finding markers and signage, external 
lighting, ramps, lifts, dedicated cycle lanes, 
bridges, underpasses and, where appropriate, 
railway arches.D Development proposals must investigate and 
maximise opportunities to enhance the public 
realm. They should seek to:
a. Improve connections to existing or planned 
transport and community infrastructure, 
including open space;
b. Make provision for cycle parking 
infrastructure and bus stops; 
c. Enhance and where appropriate help to 
reinstate connections that make a positive 
contribution to the locality, including those 
that are of local importance and historic 
significance;
d. Integrate wider pavements, or widen 
pavements where these already exist; 
e. Avoid or remove barriers that unnecessarily 
impede or restrict movement and 
accessibility, and adversely impact on public 
safety; and
f. Integrate trees and other urban greening 
measures.
E Development proposals should be designed to 
establish or reinforce a clearly defined public 
realm that helps to support the function of 
different uses within an area and protects local 
amenity.

night, and throughout the year. This includes 
consideration of how the local microclimatic 
impacts on people’s health and comfort. 
Development proposals must make provision 
for public realm that is appropriate to the 
uses(s) involved along with the location, 
nature and scale of development, including 
consideration for:
a. Public conveniences, including toilets and 
changing facilities, particularly for families 
with children and those with specialist 
needs;
b. Free drinking water fountains;
c. Sensitively integrated lighting;
d. Shading and shelter to protect and provide 
comfort from direct sunlight, rain and wind; 
e. Public art;
f. Benches and other types of seating; 
g. Formal and informal play space, addressing 
the needs of people of different ages and 
abilities; and
h. Adaptable space to support events and 
activities (such as markets, civic and cultural 
events) and infrastructure to support these, 
such as connections to power and water.G Public realm should be sustainability designed 
and constructed, including by maximising 
opportunities for urban greening and 
mitigating the impacts of climate change, with 
reference to other Local Plan policies. Priority 
should be given to the use of high quality 
and durable materials, with permeable or 
semi-permeable surfaces integrated wherever 
possible.
Public art
H Development proposals, particularly for major 
development, should investigate opportunities 
to integrate public art to enhance the 
legibility of the public realm, enhance the 
distinctiveness of buildings and spaces, and to 
help to foster a sense of place. The use of local 
artists for public art commissions is strongly 
encouraged.
I Public art, including installations, proposed 
to be integrated as part of a development, 
or within the public realm, should be 
appropriately located in a prominent position 
and be sensitively sited and/or fixed to a 
building in a manner that:
a. Responds positively to the site context and 
local character, including historic character 
and the significance of heritage assets;
b. Enhances the legibility of the public realm; 
and
c. Does not adversely impact on amenity.
82J Where public art is proposed to be provided, 
the location, siting and general design of the 
art, along with long-term management and 
maintenance arrangements, must be agreed 
by the Council prior to its installation.
Effectively managing the public realm
K Development proposals must ensure that 
appropriate management and maintenance 
arrangements are in place for the public 
realm. Where provision is made for privately 
owned public space this should be managed 
in the same manner as public space, ensuring 
the space is inclusive and access is not 
unreasonably restricted. Management Plans 
will be required for Major development and 
other proposals with significant elements of 
public realm. Planning contributions and/or 
legal agreements may be used to secure the 
appropriate management of the public realm.

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNExplanation
5.19 Public realm consists of all the publicly accessible 
space between buildings, whether public or 
privately owned. This includes elements of 
the transport network (such as pavements, 
streets and cycleways), amenity spaces (such as 
station forecourts, squares, play areas and open 
spaces) and internal spaces in buildings open to 
and frequented by the public (such as station 
concourses, shopping malls, markets and cultural 
facilities).
5.20 Public realm performs a key role in shaping the 
character of Lewisham’s neighbourhoods and 
influencing the function of the buildings and 
spaces within them. It also factors significantly 
in the population’s physical and mental health 
and wellbeing, and quality of life. This is because 
the public realm affects how people experience 
the Borough through their movements and daily 
activities. It also impacts on the opportunities 
available to people of all ages and abilities to 
lead healthy and active lifestyles. 
5.21 It is important that the different elements of 
the public realm are not considered in isolation 
of each other or the people and places they 
support. Rather the public realm should be seen 
in a holistic way, as a series of connected routes 
and spaces that together help to form the urban 
and social fabric of the Borough. The public realm 
links Lewisham’s places and neighbourhoods with 
one another, enabling people to access homes, 
jobs, community facilities, services and leisure 
and recreational opportunities, whether within 
the Borough or elsewhere.5.22 The design of development should be informed 
by an understanding of how people currently 
use, or will be expected to use, the public realm. 
Placing people at the heart of the design process 
will help to secure inclusive and well-functioning 
spaces and places. Development should be 
designed and built to the human scale, for 
example, by integrating generous public realm 
treatments, building set-backs and articulations, 
active ground floor frontages and greening 
measures.
5.23 In addressing the public realm, development 
proposals should prioritise the movement of 
people by walking, cycling and the use of 
public transport, in line with the Healthy Streets 
Approach. This policy should therefore be read in 
conjunction with Policy TR3 (Healthy streets as 
part of healthy neighbourhoods).  Development 
proposals are also encouraged to refer to the 
Government’s Manual for Streets guidance42. 
5.24 Public realm should be designed to reflect, 
reinforce and enhance the distinctive features 
of Lewisham’s neighbourhoods that contribute 
to shaping local character and identity. 
Development should help to create welcoming, 
attractive, vibrant and healthy places where 
people have ample opportunity to relax, socialise 
and enjoy leisure pursuits at different times of 
the day, evening and night time and throughout 
the year. This is especially important within and 
around Lewisham’s town centres, which are key 
focal points for civic and public life. 
42 The Department for Transport is updating its 'Manual 
for Streets' guidance and this will supersede the Manual for 
Streets (2007) and Manual for Streets 2 (2010). 
845.25 Where appropriate, opportunities should be 
taken to make provision for adaptable space 
to support different types of activities, such as 
markets, and cultural and civic events. This is 
particularly for major development proposals 
or other developments incorporating or located 
adjacent to larger public open spaces, such as 
squares and station forecourts. Development 
should include, or be designed to enable 
connections to infrastructure to support these 
activities, such as electrical outlets and water.
5.26 All public realm should be designed to achieve 
high sustainability standards, with reference to 
other Local Plan policies. There are significant 
opportunities to incorporate urban greening and 
sustainable drainage measures within the public 
realm, which development proposals will be 
required to investigate and maximise. 
5.27 Without proper management the public realm 
can deteriorate over time, compromising its 
function and amenity value. Development should 
be designed to prevent against the need for 
excessive site management requirements. For 
example, the use of durable materials, drought 
tolerant, perennial species for tree planting and 
other greening measures can provide a cost-
efficient way to maintain public realm over the 
long-term.  5.28 It is imperative that the public realm supports 
inclusive neighbourhoods and communities. We 
will refuse development proposals that seek to 
place inappropriate controls on the public realm, 
such as for public access and use.  It is recognised 
there may be a need for reasonable measures to 
address liability, public health and safety which 
will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

A Tall buildings are substantially taller than their 
surroundings and cause a significant change 
to the skyline. Within Lewisham Tall Buildings 
are defined as buildings which are 10 storeys 
or 32.8 meters measured from the ground 
level to the top of the building (including any 
rooftop equipment), or greater. Development 
proposals for tall buildings will be assessed 
against and must comply with London Plan 
policy D9 (Tall buildings) and the following:
B Tall buildings should only be developed in 
locations identified as appropriate for tall 
buildings on the Policies Map (i.e. Tall Building 
Suitability Zones). Development proposals for 
tall buildings outside of these zones will be 
resisted. 
C Within those locations identified as 
appropriate for tall buildings, the maximum 
height of buildings shall not normally be more 
than:
a. 80.8 meters (25 storeys) to 151.2 meters 
(48 storeys) in Deptford / North Deptford
b. 52.0 meters (16 storeys) to 112.8 meters 
(35 storeys) in Lewisham Town Centre
c. 39.2 meters (12 storeys) to 64.8 meters (20 
storeys) in Catford 
d. 64.8 meters (20 storeys) to 96.8m (30 
storeys) in Deptford Creekside
e. 32.8 meters (10 storeys) to 48.8 meters (15 
storeys) in New Cross and New Cross Gate
f. 32.8 meters(10 storeys) to 39.2 meters (12 
storeys) in Bellingham and Lee Green
g. 39.2 meters (12 storeys) to 52.0 meters (16 storeys) in Lower Sydenham / Bell Green 
proposed opportunity area.  
 
Refer to figures 5.3 to 5.10 for further 
details.
D Development proposals for tall buildings 
will only be permitted where they are in a 
Tall Building Suitability Zone, align with the 
appropriate height ranges set out above and it 
is demonstrated that the development: 
a. Will contribute to delivery of, and is not 
at odds with, the spatial strategy for the 
Borough;
b. Is of an exceptionally good design and 
architectural quality;
c. Is sensitive to the site’s immediate and 
wider context with reference to Figure 5.2 
(Tall Building Sensitivity Plan), including the 
distinctiveness of Thames Policy Area in line 
with Policy LNA4 (Thames Policy Area and 
Deptford Creekside);
d. Will not result in any unacceptable adverse 
visual, functional, environmental and 
cumulative impacts, with reference to the 
requirements of London Plan policy D9 (Tall 
Buildings);
e. Will make a positive contribution to the 
townscape and skyline; 
f. Will not adversely impact on strategic and 
local views, vistas and landmarks, including 
strategic background views, with reference 
to Policy QD5 (View management); 
g. Will preserve or enhance the significance of 
heritage assets and their setting; and
h. Provides a high quality public realm in 
line with Policy QD3 (Public realm and 
87

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNconnecting places). Where appropriate, 
development will be required to make 
provision for free to enter, publicly-
accessible areas that are incorporated into 
the building.
E Development proposals for tall buildings 
should incorporate sensitively designed 
measures to ensure public safety at height 
such as barriers, rails and anti-climb 
equipment. These must be considered as 
part of the overall design-led approach and 
contribute positively to the skyline. 
F Tall buildings must be delivered through a 
masterplan process in order to ensure that 
they are appropriately located, designed to a 
high quality standard and effectively managed 
over the lifetime of the development. The 
requirements for masterplans are set out in 
Policy DM4 (Masterplans and comprehensive 
development).

90Explanation
5.29 In order to deliver the spatial strategy and meet 
local needs, such as for new housing, workspace 
and community facilities, it is imperative that 
development proposals optimise the capacity of 
sites. Well-designed and sensitively integrated, 
higher density development that responds 
positively to its local context can support Good 
Growth. Higher density development can be 
achieved through a wide range of site layouts 
and building forms and does not necessarily 
require tall or taller buildings. 
5.30 Tall and taller buildings are prominent features 
that can have significant impacts on the London 
skyline, the character of townscapes and local 
neighbourhoods as well as the amenity of the 
population and natural environment. Buildings 
that are appropriately located and well-designed 
can help people to navigate through the Borough 
by providing reference points for wayfinding and 
emphasising the hierarchy of places. However 
where tall and taller buildings are inappropriately 
located and poorly designed they can have 
detrimental impacts. These impacts may include 
disruption to established views and vistas or 
landmarks, harm to heritage assets and their 
setting, disturbance to the character and visual 
amenity of streetscapes and townscapes, and the 
introduction of microclimate conditions such as 
wind tunnels. Poorly designed buildings can also 
adversely impact on community safety as well as 
the mental and physical health and wellbeing of 
the population.5.31 Development proposals for taller buildings must 
demonstrate a clear understanding of, and 
respond positively to, the site context including 
heritage assets, their setting and the historical 
pattern of development. The reference point for 
the prevailing height of buildings will vary on a 
case-by-case basis, even within a neighbourhood. 
Not all existing tall or taller buildings will be 
appropriate references for new development. For 
example, some tower blocks built in the 1960s 
and 1970s detract from the historic character 
and townscape features within a neighbourhood 
and are therefore not suitable reference points. 
The cumulative impact of tall or taller buildings 
within a site or locality will also be an important 
consideration. Applicants are encouraged to refer 
the Lewisham Characterisation Study (2019) and 
where relevant Conservation Area Appraisals, 
Supplementary Planning Documents and Area 
Frameworks to develop an understanding of 
the site context. Design and Access Statements 
should clearly set out what features of the built 
and natural environment have been used as 
reference points to inform the development 
design and building heights.

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNFigure 5.2: Tall Buildings sensitivity plan
925.32 There may be locations where the prevailing 
heights of buildings are expected to evolve 
over time. For instance, there are areas within 
Lewisham where the spatial strategy provides in-
principle support for the sensitive intensification 
of neighbourhoods, including through the 
comprehensive redevelopment of sites. This 
includes Growth Corridors, Opportunity 
Areas, Growth Nodes and Regeneration 
Nodes. Furthermore, there may be consented 
developments that establish new land use 
and design principles and which will influence 
the existing character of a site or area once 
implemented. 5.33 The London Plan provides that tall buildings 
will play a role in supporting Good Growth 
across London. It directs the Local Plan to 
identify locations where tall buildings may be 
an appropriate form of development and to 
set a local definition for tall buildings43.  This 
policy helps give effect to the London Plan. The 
Policies Map designates Suitability Zones for tall 
buildings (also shown in Figure 5.1 , Figure 5.3  
to Figure 5.10  and Table 21.12 ). This must be 
read together with part C of the policy above 
which provides the recommended maximum 
building heights. The zones and heights have 
been informed by the Lewisham Characterisation 
Study (2019), Lewisham Tall Buildings Study 
(2020) and Tall Buildings Study Addendum 
(2022).  Whilst Suitability Zones have been 
identified this does not mean that tall buildings 
are automatically acceptable within them or that 
the maximum building heights are appropriate in 
every instance. Although maximum heights are 
provided for each for the Tall Building Suitability 
Zones, proposals will still be expected to include 
robust design justifications for the heights 
proposed, including testing in key views.
43 London Plan (2021) policy D9 (Tall buildings) provides 
that tall buildings should not be less than 6 storeys or 18 
metres measured from ground to the floor level of the 
uppermost storey.

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGN5.34 Development proposals will be considered 
on a case-by-case basis taking into account 
their impacts on an individual site level and 
cumulatively in combination with other existing, 
consented and planned tall and taller buildings. 
Impacts include those in the building’s immediate 
vicinity, surrounding area and elsewhere in 
London. Development proposals should refer 
the Tall Building Sensitivity Plan ( Figure 5.2 ) 
early in the design-led approach to understand 
site-specific sensitivities and development 
constraints. The Council will normally employ 
the use of graphic 3D modelling to assess 
development proposals, such as enabled by 
VU.CITY software, and applicants will be required 
to submit technical information to support this 
analysis.
5.35 Development proposals for tall buildings will 
also be assessed in accordance with London 
Plan policy D9 (Tall buildings). Proposals must 
include a sufficient level of information to 
demonstrate that potential impacts have been 
suitably identified and adequately addressed. 
Development proposals will be refused where they will result in an unacceptable visual, 
functional, environmental and/or cumulative 
impact. Development proposals for building 
heights that depart from the parameters set 
by the Local Plan will be considered having 
regard to relevant material considerations. In 
such circumstances a wider public benefit must 
be demonstrated to justify the design of the 
development. 
5.36 The Maritime Greenwich World Heritage 
Site, Thames Policy Area and London View 
Management Framework views are important 
considerations for tall and taller buildings. 
There are riverside locations within the Borough 
that have been identified as being potentially 
sensitive to tall buildings44.  The Maritime 
Greenwich World Heritage Site Buffer Zone 
is considered inappropriate for tall buildings. 
Tall buildings can also adversely impact on 
biodiversity and developments should therefore 
be appropriately sited and designed to avoid 
shading or casting light spill on Sites of 
Importance for Nature Conservation.

are a number of strategic views including 
London Strategic Views and Lewisham Local 
Views which help to define the character 
of London and contribute to the Borough’s 
local distinctiveness. These strategic views, 
including their Protected Vistas, will be

managed positively. 
C Development proposals must not harm 
and, wherever possible, seek to make a 
positive contribution to the characteristics 
and composition of London Strategic Views 
and Lewisham Local Views, including their 
protected vistas and landmark elements. 
Development proposals should also seek 
to preserve or where possible enhance a 
viewers’ ability to recognise and appreciate the 
landmark elements within these views.D Development proposals affecting London 
Strategic Views, Lewisham Local Views and 
Local Landmarks will be assessed having 
regard to their contribution to preserving and

and
b. Compliance with the principles and policies 
for managing views set out in London Plan

5.37 There are a number of views that make 
an important strategic contribution to the 
distinctiveness and character of Lewisham and 
London. These views help to define the form of 
the city. They also help to shape people’s sense of 
place, particularly as the views provide corridors 
that lead to or reveal important landmarks, 
townscape and landscape features. A positive 
approach to managing these views and landmarks 
over the long term is important, particularly given 
the increasing pressure to accommodate growth 
and new development within the Borough.
5.38 The London Plan identifies and includes 
policies to protect London Strategic Views 
which include significant buildings, urban 
landscapes and riverscapes that help to define 
London at a strategic level. There are two such 
strategic views traversing Lewisham. These are 
the ‘London Panoramas’ from Greenwich Park 
(General Wolfe’s Statue) to Central London and 
Blackheath Point to Central London (the dome 
of St Paul’s Cathedral). The London Plan sets 
policies f for managing these strategic views, 
with further guidance included in the Mayor’s 
London View Management Framework (LVMF) 
SPG, which development proposals should refer as 
appropriate. It is imperative that these panoramic 
views of London, and the key landmarks within 
them, are not compromised by new development 
and that people can continue to experience and 
enjoy them.
5.39 There are also a number of important Lewisham 
Local Views that warrant protection and positive 
management. In addition, a number of Local 
Landmarks have been designated because they 
add to the distinctive character and quality of the 
the Borough and provide points of visual interest. These Local Views and Landmarks are listed in 
Figure 5.11  and Part 5 of the Local Plan.
5.40 Development proposals that are likely to affect 
London Strategic Views, Lewisham Local Views 
and Local Landmarks will be considered against 
the principles and policies for managing views in 
the London Plan. This includes consideration of 
impacts on the foreground, middle ground and 
background of the designated view and landmark 
features. In addition, proposals will be considered 
against relevant Local Plan policies that seek to 
protect and enhance Lewisham’s distinctive local 
character. Applicants are encouraged to refer the 
London View Management Framework SPG and 
the Council’s Local Plan evidence base, including 
Conservation Area Appraisals and the Lewisham 
Characterisation Study (2019).Protected view from Blythe Hill Fields
1005.41 Development proposals should seek to enhance 
public access to viewing locations through public 
realm improvements. Opportunities should also 
be taken to create new local views and vistas. 
Proposals for major development, including 
where multiple sites are to be brought forward 
comprehensively, present particular opportunities 
to enhance views. Consideration should be given 
to the layout, orientation and height of buildings 
and spaces to enhance existing viewing corridors, 
or introduce new ones, to help reveal townscapes 
and landmarks. Development proposals should 
also maximise the visual amenity provided by 
watercourses in the Borough. 5.42 The Council is required to consult the London 
Mayor where buildings are proposed in an area 
which may affect a Protected Vista, and where 
they are beyond the areas currently designated 
as Wider Consultation Area in the London View 
Management Framework SPG. Development 
poroposals sited in the background of a Protected 
Vista must have regard to the impact of the 
development on the view so that it does not 
harm the setting of the Protected Vistas, whether 
the proposal falls inside the wider setting 
consultation area of a protected vista or not. 
The Mayor of London has produced a map for 
indicative purposes showing the extensions to the 
background of the Protected Vistas.

optimise the capacity of a site, with reference 
to Policy QD1 (Delivering high quality design 
in Lewisham).
B To establish the optimum capacity of a site 
consideration must be given to the appropriate 
development density having regard to:
a. The type and nature of uses proposed;
b. The site context, with reference to the site’s 
immediate and surrounding area, taking into 
account:
i. Location setting;
ii. Local distinctiveness and character,

impacts of development.
C Development parameters for specific sites 
are set out in this Local Plan (Part 3 - site 
allocations). Where development proposals 
do not accord with the indicative capacity set 
out in a site allocation policy, they will only 
be supported where it is clearly demonstrated 
the optimal capacity will be achieved, having 
regard to (A) and (B) above.  
103
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNExplanation
5.43 The delivery of Good Growth will necessitate that 
new developments use the Borough’s limited 
supply of land effectively and efficiently, whilst 
improving the quality of places and spaces that 
people inhabit and use, along with the natural 
environment.
5.44 Development proposals must demonstrate how 
they will deliver the optimum capacity of a site. 
The optimum capacity is one that is derived 
through careful consideration of density taking 
into account the site’s local character, the types 
of uses proposed, access to public transport 
and the infrastructure available to support the 
development. The optimum capacity is not the 
maximum capacity or density. Development 
proposals should provide evidence of an options 
appraisal, undertaken at the early stage of 
the design process, which demonstrates the 
approach to achieving the optimum capacity. 
This requirement may be applied flexibly taking 
into account the location, nature and scale of 
development. For instance, for householder and 
other smaller developments a planning statement 
may be sufficient. 
5.45 Development proposals must demonstrate an 
understanding of a site’s contribution to local 
character. This includes the historical pattern 
of development along with the existing and 
emerging character of the locality. The Lewisham 
Characterisation Study should be referred at the 
early stage in the design-led approach. It is a 
useful starting point for considering densities 
and provides an indication of those areas where 
new development should focus on reinforcing the 
established urban form and fabric, as well as those 
that may be more receptive to gradually managed 
change or transformation. 5.46 The spatial strategy requires that new and 
higher density development is focussed within 
and around well-connected locations. Proposals 
must demonstrate how they have responded to 
accessibility, referring the latest Public Transport 
Access Level (PTAL) maps (published by TfL), and 
also assessing opportunities walking and cycling, 
including those that could be delivered by the 
development itself. 
5.47 Development proposals should address both 
existing and future PTALs taking account of 
planned improvements to the network of transport 
infrastructure. The phasing of development will 
need to be carefully managed, especially where 
infrastructure is planned but not yet implemented. 
This will be a particularly important consideration 
in Lewisham’s Central and South areas, where 
the delivery of the Bakerloo line extension will 
drastically improve PTALs over the long-term (see 
Part 3 of the Local Plan). Policies TR1 and TR2 set 
out further details in this regard.
5.48 The introduction of new, higher-density 
development within an area may put pressure 
on existing facilities and infrastructure or 
create additional demands. Development 
proposals should therefore assess and plan 
positively for infrastructure needed to support 
the densities sought. This includes but is not 
limited to transport, community, green and 
other environmental infrastructure. Planning 
contributions and/or legal agreements may be 
used to secure infrastructure.
1045.49 The optimum capacity of a site should informed by 
the nature and mix of uses proposed. Residential-
led schemes will generally be supported where 
density levels are appropriate to the local context 
and they deliver high quality and genuinely 
affordable housing. Commercial and industrial 
developments should seek opportunities to 
intensify uses on employment sites to deliver more 
jobs and new workspace. Mixed-use schemes will 
require careful consideration of amenity for all 
users and activities. 
5.50 To  support the delivery of Good Growth, and 
ensure densities are appropriate to their location, 
we will prepare planning guidance for specific 
areas. This includes the Catford Town Centre 
Framework and the A21 Development Framework. 
The Small Sites SPD provides guidance to support 
the sensitive intensification of residential and 
other areas.

a. Appropriate provision of privacy is made, 
ensuring development does not result in 
unreasonable levels of overlooking;
b. Adequate provision for outlook, and 
demonstrate how this has been optimised;
c. Adequate levels of ventilation, daylight, 
sunlight and open aspects including 
provision of private amenity space where 
appropriate; 
d. New noise sensitive development is sited 
away from existing noise generating uses

to mitigate and manage light pollution by 
ensuring that lighting is:
a. Appropriate for its purpose in its setting; 
and
b. Designed and operated to minimise and 
control the level of illumination, glare, angle 
and spillage of light, particularly to protect 
sensitive receptors such as residential 
properties and natural habitats, including 
water habitats.

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNExplanation
5.51 It is important that new development contributes 
to the delivery of high quality and healthy living 
environments that people can enjoy without 
disturbance. 
5.52 The London Plan establishes the Agent of 
Change principle. This places the responsibility 
for mitigating the impact of noise on new 
development. This means that where new 
developments are proposed close to existing 
noise generating uses, they must be designed to 
protect the new occupiers from noise impacts. 
As well, where new noise generating uses are 
proposed close to noise sensitive uses the 
responsibility will be on the new use to ensure 
the building or activity is designed to protect the 
existing residents or uses from noise. Whilst the 
Agent of Change principle deals predominantly 
with noise it also addresses other nuisances 
including vibration, odour, fumes, dust, artificial 
light and site waste. When considering the impact 
of new development, we will apply the Agent of 
Change principle in accordance with the London 
Plan.
5.53 Development must protect and wherever possible 
enhance local amenity using the design-led 
approach. Careful consideration should be given 
to site selection along with the layout, design, 
construction and operation of buildings and 
spaces, including the public realm, at the early 
stage. Applications must provide a sufficient level 
of information to demonstrate that potential 
impacts have been identified, assessed and 
avoided or appropriately mitigated. Where 
there will be ongoing and future management 
of mitigation measures, these may be secured 
by planning obligations or legal agreements. Proposals that are likely to cause unreasonable 
harm to the amenity of users of the development 
or occupants and uses in neighbouring properties 
will be refused. 
5.54 For new housing or other development near 
residential properties, proposals must ensure 
provision of adequate daylight, sunlight, 
outlook and privacy. Development should not 
cause significant or unreasonable harm in terms 
of overshadowing or overlooking. Proposals 
will be expected to take account of existing 
and proposed future uses, for example, by 
considering land use principles established by 
unimplemented planning consents, masterplans 
or site allocation policies. 
5.55 Proposals will be expected to submit a Noise 
Impact Assessment and/or Vibration Impact 
Assessment where sites are located in high-noise 
areas or where a new development is likely to 
generate significant noise or vibration. This will 
enable the consideration of how the existing 
noise environment affects any proposed noise 
sensitive development and the potential impact 
that new noise generating development will have 
on the local area.
5.56 The Council’s Good Practice Guide: Control 
of Pollution and Noise from Demolition and 
Construction Sites has been prepared to assist 
developers and their contractors in ensuring 
that they carry out their works in the most 
considerate manner. Transport for London also 
provides standing guidance on the Construction 
Logistic Plan required for major developments 
and the assessment of traffic movements, which 
applicants are encouraged to refer.
1085.57 Noise generating cultural and community 
venues (such as theatres, concert halls, pubs 
and live music venues) should be protected 
for the benefit of the wider community and 
the local economy. Development proposals in 
the vicinity of these types of facilities must be 
designed  to ensure such uses remain viable, 
can operate without the threat of closure due to 
noise complaints and can continue to operate 
as they are without licensing restrictions. This 
is particularly important in Lewisham’s town 
centres, Cultural Quarters and the Creative 
Enterprise Zone.
5.58 We will seek to protect open spaces as tranquil 
havens with positive soundscapes where 
people can interact with the natural acoustic 
environment, including natural sounds, animal 
vocalisation, weather, water and river flows. 
Development proposals should recognise and 
respond positively to the value of tranquil and 
quiet areas. Opportunities should be taken to 
protect and enhance these environments for the 
benefit of the local community and biodiversity.
Artificial lighting
5.59 Artificial lighting can make a positive 
contribution to the quality of places. For 
example, it can help to ensure a safe and legible 
environment for walking and cycling; extend 
opportunities for leisure, sport and recreation by 
enabling evening and night-time use of facilities; 
and enhance the appearance of buildings and 
townscapes. If not appropriately managed 
however, artificial lighting has the potential 
to become light pollution which can present 
physiological, ecological and other environmental 
issues.5.60 Details of lighting schemes should be in line 
with the latest industry guidance published by 
the Institute of Lighting Professionals. Proposals 
should take into account that Lewisham, on 
the whole, falls within Zone 3 Medium District 
Brightness Areas. However this will need to be 
established on a case-by-case basis as there 
are variations in localities, for example, in 
Lewisham Town Centre where Zone 4 may apply.  
Residential development proposals should seek 
to achieve the 2-LUX standard.
5.61 Development should provide sensitively 
integrated lighting within the public realm to 
contribute to safe and attractive environments. 
Proposals will need to address the potential 
adverse effect of lighting on amenity and 
biodiversity, including water habitats. Lighting 
from new buildings must be designed and 
positioned in a way that minimises floodlighting. 
Where public areas need to be lit close to green 
and water spaces, careful positioning of light 
sources will be required, with the beam directed 
away from sensitive areas such as trees and 
rivers. The use of time or movement sensitive 
lighting is encouraged to support benefits to 
biodiversity and energy conservation.
5.62 This policy is separate from statutory artificial 
lighting nuisance controls relevant to the Clean 
Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 and 
Environmental Protection Act 1990.

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGN110Opposite: Heathside and Leathbridge Amenity Space (BPTW)QD8 High quality housing design
A High quality design is integral to ensuring 
housing that meets the diverse and changing 
needs of Lewisham residents over their lifetimes. 
All development proposals for housing  must 
ensure provision for adequately-sized rooms and 
living spaces, comfortable and functional layouts 
and well-integrated amenities. This includes 
development proposals for new-build housing, 
changes of use, alterations and extensions.
B Development proposals for housing must meet, 
and wherever possible seek to exceed, the 
housing standards set out in the London Plan, 
including the minimum standards for:
a. Private internal space, having regard to:
i. Internal floor area and built-in storage area;
ii. Bedroom size;
iii. Ceiling height
b. Private outside space, having regard to:
i. Outside space adequate for the intended 
number of occupants;
ii. Minimum depth and width of balconies or 
other private outdoor spaces;
c. Communal amenity space; and
d. Children’s play space, having regard to Policy 
CI 3 (Play and informal recreation).
C Development proposals for housing must 
address the qualitative design aspects set out 
in the London Plan Policy D6 (Housing quality 
and standards) and corresponding Table 3.2 
within the London Plan, covering the detailed 
considerations for:
a. Layout, orientation and form;
b. Outside amenity space; and
c. Usability and ongoing maintenance. 
D Development proposals for housing must be 
designed to be inclusive, accessible and safe to all, with reference to Policy QD2 (Inclusive and 
safe design).
E Development proposals for housing must be 
designed to protect and enhance amenity of 
building occupants, as well as that of adjoining 
site users and uses, in line with Policy QD7 
(Amenity and agent of change). They must 
ensure adequate provision of natural light 
with reference to the latest Building Research 
Establishment (BRE) good practice guidance, 
currently BR209: Site layout planning for 
daylight and sunlight, or suitable equivalent.
F Development proposals for housing must 
be designed to be ‘tenure blind’ and ‘tenure 
neutral’ to ensure that houses across all tenures 
are indistinguishable from one another in 
terms of quality of design and materials, space 
standards, access and amenity provision. Further 
details on ‘tenure neutral design are set out in 
Policy QD2 (Inclusive and safe design).
G Development proposals for housing must 
maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings. 
Proposals for single aspect dwellings, particularly 
north facing dwellings will be resisted and 
only be permitted where it can be suitably 
demonstrated that the development will provide 
a more appropriate design solution than a dual 
aspect dwelling, having particular regard to:
a. Site or building size, layout and orientation;
b. Outlook for occupiers;
c. Microclimate management including for 
heating, cooling and ventilation; and
d. Amenity including adequate privacy and 
protection against exposure to odour, noise, 
light and air pollution.

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNExplanation
5.63 Everyone should have access to a decent 
and secure home that is adaptable to one’s 
changing needs over their lifetime. All new 
housing development, irrespective of tenure, 
must be designed to a high quality standard in 
order to meet the diverse needs of Lewisham’s 
resident population, taking into account those 
who choose to live independently, families 
(including with children) and others sharing 
accommodation, and those requiring managed 
support or care. This includes new build housing, 
the alteration or extension of existing housing 
units, and the conversion of other buildings into 
housing.
5.64 The quality and standard of housing is a key 
issue in Lewisham. One in four residents now 
live in the private rented sector, which is double 
that of 15 years ago. We estimate that a quarter 
of private rented properties are non-decent. As 
further evidence, between January 2015 and 
October 2018 the Council received over 2,000 
complaints about the condition of private rented 
properties. We inspected all these properties 
and found around half of them had poor energy 
efficiency (rating of D or below). Whilst the 
proportion of social housing units meeting the 
Decent Homes standard increased from 41% to 
94% in the ten years from 2007, the Council’s 
own research suggests private sector housing is 
not achieving the same level of standards45. 5.65 We will apply the London Plan space standards 
when considering housing proposals (including 
for internal and outside space, communal 
amenity space and children’s play space). We will 
also have regard to the qualitative design aspects 
set out in London Plan Policy D6, along with 
other Local Plan policies.  Applicants are advised 
to refer the London Plan for further details. 
Development proposals must meet and should 
seek to exceed the minimum standards.
5.66 Development proposals must support mixed 
and inclusive neighbourhoods and communities 
by ensuring that housing of all tenure types 
are designed to a high quality standard and 
well-integrated, both within the site and 
neighbourhood. Housing must be designed to 
be ‘tenure blind’ so that affordable housing 
buildings and units are similar to market housing 
in design quality, including external appearance, 
with entrances and access routes that promote 
social inclusion. Communal amenity spaces must 
be accessible to all residents of the development, 
regardless of tenure.
45  Lewisham Housing Strategy 2020-2026. Lewisham Council
1125.67 Dual aspect dwellings with opening windows 
on at least two sides have many benefits for 
the amenity of building occupiers, including 
for daylight, outlook and natural ventilation. 
Single aspect dwellings do not offer the same 
benefits, particularly for natural ventilation, 
which is problematic in terms of climate change 
adaptation. Single aspect dwellings should be 
avoided where they are north facing, contain 
three or more bedrooms, or exposed to noise 
and air pollution levels above which significant 
adverse effects on health and quality of life 
occur. The design of single aspect dwellings 
must demonstrate that all habitable rooms and 
the kitchen are provided with adequate passive 
ventilation, privacy, daylight and outlook, and 
that the unit’s microclimate will be appropriately 
managed.

A Development proposals for building 
alterations, extensions and basements must 
be designed to a high quality standard and

Extensions SPD.
B Development proposals for building alterations 
and extensions will only be supported where 
they:
a. Respect and complement the form, 
proportion, setting, period, architectural 
characteristics and detailing of the original 
building and the site;
b. Use high quality, durable and matching or 
complementary materials; 
c. Maintain and wherever possible enhance, 
and do not adversely impact on, the 
architectural integrity of a group of 
buildings as a whole, or cause an 
incongruous element in terms of the 
important features of an area’s character; 
and 
d. Do not adversely impact on, or result in 
the loss of, the amenity of neighbouring 
properties, including back gardens.
C Innovative and contemporary designs will only 
be supported where they are of an exceptional 
design quality and comply with (B) above.
D Roof extensions on the street frontage of a 
building, particularly within predominantly 
residential street, should be avoided in favour 
of extensions to the rear of the building. 
Development proposals for roof extensions on the street frontage will only be supported 
where it is demonstrated that there is a clear 
design rationale, a design options appraisal 
has been undertaken that demonstrates an 
extension to the rear of building is not feasible 
or appropriate, and other policies are satisfied.
E Residential extensions should retain an 
accessible and functional private garden 
area which is appropriate in size in relation 
to building and the intended number of 
occupants of the dwelling. Development 
proposals should seek to retain 50 per cent of 
the original garden area.
F New units or rooms created by a residential 
alteration or extension must ensure adequate 
living and amenity space for all intended 
occupiers.
Basement development
G Proposals for basement development must 
include a Basement Impact Assessment.
H Basement development will only be permitted 
where it can be suitably demonstrated that the 
development:
a. Is sensitively integrated into the site, 
proportionate to host building (including 
the original building in the case of a 
basement extension) and avoids harm to 
local and historical character;
b. Will not adversely impact on the structural 
stability of the host building, neighbouring 
properties, infrastructure and the public 
realm, taking into account local geology;

whilst ensuring users of the development 
will be safe from all sources of flooding.
d. Will not adversely impact on the natural 
environment; and
e. Will not adversely impact on the amenity 
of neighbouring properties on occupation 
and use, and minimise impacts on amenity 
during construction.
I Proposals for residential basement 
development extending beneath the garden 
area must demonstrate that:
a. There will be no loss of or harm to trees of 
value, including amenity and townscape 
value,; and
b. The development will maintain adequate soil 
depth satisfactory for landscaping, taking 
into account impacts on and requirements 
of neighbouring properties.
J Development proposals for basements 
including habitable rooms for housing, or other 
sensitive uses, must ensure safe access and 
egress for all likely users of the development. 
K Development proposals for basements 
including toilets, bathrooms or other waste 
outlets must install an appropriate pumped 
device to protect occupiers and the property 
from sewer flooding. Light wells
L Development proposals for light wells must 
respect the architectural and historical 
character of the host building and its wider 
setting, and not adversely impact on the 
amenity of neighbouring properties. Light 
wells should be sensitively integrated and 
designed to avoid the loss of amenity space, 
including garden land. Proposals that will 
result in an excessive or harmful loss of 
amenity space will be resisted. 
116Explanation
5.68 All new building extensions, alterations and 
basement developments must be designed 
to a high quality standard. Where this type 
of development is poorly designed and 
built it can have an adverse impact on local 
character, particularly on buildings of historic 
interest or within established residential areas, 
including Conservation Areas and Areas of 
Special Character. The Council’s Alterations 
and Extensions SPD (2019) should be referred 
as appropriate. This guidance document sets 
out clear principles and guidelines to help 
householders and others to deliver high quality 
developments. 
5.69 Extensions to residential buildings should 
normally be subordinate in scale to the original 
building. This is in order to ensure that new 
development does not dominate existing and 
well-established features of the building or 
setting, or result in disproportionate additions 
that detract from local character. Alterations and 
extensions must also respect the architectural 
qualities and coherence of the urban grain, for 
example, by taking into account the distinctive 
qualities of blocks or terraces of buildings and 
responding to their established uniformity.
5.70 Innovative, high quality and creative 
contemporary designs should carefully consider 
the architectural language and integrity of 
the original building and its setting, and avoid 
awkward jarring building forms that detract from 
local character.Basement development
5.71 Basement developments are becoming an 
increasingly popular way for householders to 
adapt their homes to changing lifestyles and 
needs, for example, to create more amenity 
or living space. Not all new basements will 
require planning consent owing to permitted 
development rights. Where planning permission 
is required, proposals will be assessed against 
the Local Plan policies. Consideration must be 
given to impacts on structural stability of the host 
building and adjoining properties, as well as to 
any environmental impacts that are likely to arise 
from the development. These matters must be 
addressed through a Basement Impact Assessment 
(BIA) to be submitted at the application stage. 
The BIA must be carried out by a suitably 
qualified and recognised independent assessor 
and paid for by the applicant. Proposals will be 
refused where it cannot be demonstrated that 
harmful impacts will be avoided or appropriately 
mitigated. Impacts on amenity should be 
minimised as much as reasonably practical during 
construction. Depending on the nature and scale 
of development a Construction Management 
Plan may be required, and this will be secured by 
condition or legal agreement.
Light wells
5.72 Light wells can enhance the amenity of a building’s 
users and occupiers. Careful consideration is 
required to ensure new light wells do not have an 
adverse impact on amenity, including nuisance 
caused by light pollution. Light wells should 
not result in an excessive or harmful impact on 
amenity space, including garden land. We will resist 
proposals that will result in a significant loss of 
amenity space, taking into account the amount 
and quality of amenity space on site.

where: 
a. The use is appropriate to the site and  will 
not result in an unreasonable adverse 
impact on the amenity of neighbouring land 
uses and properties, including their rear

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNG Development proposals that will result in the 
loss of garden land, including private back 
gardens, will be strongly resisted. This includes 
the development of back gardens for separate 
dwellings in perimeter forms of housing. The 
loss of garden land will only be considered 
acceptable in exceptional circumstances where:
a. The proposal is for comprehensive 
redevelopment of a number of whole land 
plots; and
b. The requirements of (A) and (B) above are

Amenity areas
H Development proposals on amenity areas of 
landscaped open space adjoining existing 
residential buildings will only be supported 
where they:
a. Repair, reinstate or re-provide active street 
frontages;
b. Retain existing private garden space; and
c. Apply inclusive and safe design principles, 
and seek opportunities to enhance natural 
surveillance.
120Explanation
5.73 There are opportunities throughout the Borough 
to make a more beneficial use of land and 
improve the quality of local areas through the 
redevelopment of small sites. New and sensitively 
integrated development on small sites can help 
to enhance local character, such as by repairing 
harmful breaks in street frontages through infill 
development or activating vacant backland sites. 
Small sites can also accommodate new housing, 
business space and other uses to meet local 
needs.
5.74 This policy addresses the types of small sites set 
out below.
• Infill sites: sites within street frontages (such 
as former builders’ yards, small workshops and 
garages, gaps in terraces and gardens to the side 
of houses). 
• Backland sites: ‘landlocked’ sites to the rear of 
street frontages and not historically in garden 
use (such as builders’ yards, small workshops 
and warehouses, and garages), often in close 
proximity to existing housing.
• Garden land (including back gardens): private 
amenity areas that were the entire back 
garden to the rear of a dwelling or dwellings as 
originally designed. Garden land is not defined 
as Previously Developed Land, as set out in the 
NPPF . 
• Amenity areas: communal amenity areas attached 
to or associated with residential development. 
Examples of these are: private communal gardens 
for small blocks of flats landscaped spaces 
around taller blocks of flats and around low and 
medium rise ‘slab blocks’, where typically the 
distinction between the public and private realms 
is ambiguous and which provide a generally less 
secure environment as a result.5.75 These small site typologies cover the majority of 
sites that will require consideration under this 
policy (extensions and alterations are dealt with 
separately in this Local Plan). However, there 
may be some instances where a site will not fall 
definitively within any one of these categories. 
In such cases, the principles that will be applied 
for planning decisions will be taken from the 
appropriate parts of this policy. The Council will 
make a determination of the relevant policies, 
informed by the planning statement submitted 
by the applicant. 
5.76 Not all infill sites will be considered appropriate 
for new development or for certain types of land 
uses. Backland, garden land and amenity area 
sites will only be acceptable for new development 
where proposals comply with the above policies. 
Development proposals must clearly demonstrate 
that the site is appropriate for the proposed 
use(s), there is a clear urban design rationale for 
bringing forward development at the location 
and there will be no adverse impact on amenity. 
This should be set out in the Design and Access 
Statement, and informed by the Council’s 
Small Sites SPD and associated Small Sites 
Development Strategy document. Some amenity 
areas may be Neighbourhood Open Spaces and 
proposals must therefore ensure compliance with 
Policy GR3 (Open space).
121
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNInfill and backland development
5.77 Development proposals for infill and backland 
development must follow the design-led 
approach. Careful consideration will need to be 
given to the distinctive character and features 
of the site and its wider setting. This includes 
the streetscape and architectural detailing, 
along with the proportions and orientation of 
buildings, including the spaces between them. 
Development on mid-terrace sites will require 
particular attention to ensure they complement 
the character of the street and provide a 
positive frontage. Infill development provides 
opportunities to repair harmful breaks in the 
street frontage.
5.78 Access and servicing requirements of backland 
sites poses unique design challenges. 
Development proposals must ensure adequate 
arrangements for all vehicles likely to require 
access the site, including for emergency services, 
refuse and recycling collection and deliveries. 
Proposals must also ensure safe and convenient 
access to the site and buildings by walking and 
cycling.
5.79 Development proposals should seek to retain and 
enhance existing walking routes and cycleways. 
Where this is not feasible or preferential in 
design terms adequate replacement provision 
must be provided. The design must ensure 
permeability within the site and the rest of the 
neighbourhood. Gated developments will be 
strongly resisted. 5.80 Where development proposals include new 
housing  this must be designed with reference to 
other Local Plan policies. Provision of accessible, 
secure, private and functional outdoor amenity 
space, including children’s play space, will be 
required where appropriate. Outdoor amenity 
space, including garden land, must not be 
delivered in a piecemeal fashion. Rather this 
must be designed in an integrated way to ensure 
it is functional space suitable for the intended 
occupants.
Garden land (including back gardens)
5.81 Garden land, including back gardens, make 
an important contribution to local character 
and amenity and often have ecological value. 
Development on garden land should therefore be 
avoided in favour of development opportunities 
elsewhere in the Borough, particularly on 
brownfield sites and previously developed land, 
consistent with the spatial strategy for the 
Borough. The NPPF is clear that garden land is 
not considered Previously Developed Land.
5.82 There is a growing body of evidence indicating 
that people who live in greener neighbourhoods 
tend to have better cardiovascular health 
and lower levels of stress46. The greater the 
biodiversity in those green spaces, the larger the 
benefit to psychological well-being. Participating 
in activities such as gardening can have physical 
and mental health benefits. This policy works 
together with other Local Plan policies on green 
infrastructure.
46 For example, the Create Streets Foundation has 
published research covering this topic. 
1225.83 Back gardens in perimeter block urban 
typologies, which have more or less enclosed rear 
gardens, are considered to be an integral part of 
the original design of these types of residential 
areas, provide valuable amenity space and an 
ecological resource. We will therefore seek to 
resist proposals for development on garden land 
in these locations. Other typologies also often 
have dwellings with private back gardens that 
do not form such a strong design feature of the 
development. These are typically associated 
with more modern development, featuring small 
gardens that are rarely longer than 10 metres 
or are quite narrow, and are therefore not 
considered suitable for development.
5.84 Development proposals that will result in the 
loss of garden land, including private back 
gardens, will be strongly resisted. This includes 
the development of back gardens for separate 
dwellings in perimeter forms of housing. The loss 
of garden land will only be considered acceptable 
in exceptional circumstances, where sites can 
be assembled to bring forward comprehensive 
redevelopment, and appropriate re-provision 
of garden land is provided to mitigate losses as 
much as possible.

A Shopfronts (including their signs, canopies and 
security installations) must be designed to a 
high quality standard. Development proposals 
for shopfronts will only be supported where 
they do not adversely impact on local character, 
amenity and public safety.
B Development proposals for new shopfronts or 
alterations to existing shopfronts must:
a. Retain, refurbish or reinstate shopfronts, or 
associated elements of architectural interest 
where these contribute to the distinctive 
visual or historic character of a building, 
townscape or area;
b. Be of a proportion, scale and quality that 
responds to the character of the host 
building and, where relevant, adjoining 
properties;
c. Use high quality materials and colours that 
are sensitive to local character; and
d. Retain or provide glazed shop windows.
C Within Conservation Areas and residential 
areas, internally illuminated box fascia signs 
and projecting signs will not be permitted 
unless they successfully relate to the design and 
detailing of buildings and contribute positively 
to the distinctive character of a group of 
buildings or street.
D Development proposals for open shopfronts 
without a stall riser and glazed screen will be 
resisted.E Development proposals for shopfront canopies 
that are fixed in the ‘down’ position will 
be resisted. Retractable canopies may be 
acceptable where they are designed to provide 
sufficient clearance.
F Shopfront security features, including roller 
grilles and shutters, must not be visually 
intrusive, create blank frontages or detract 
from the character of the host building and 
townscape. Where such installations are 
considered necessary development proposals 
should seek to use internally located, open 
mesh security shutters and boxes.
G Where proposals require a new shopfront as 
part of a mixed-use scheme, including re-
provision of an existing unit, development will 
be expected to make provision for shopfront 
fit out.
H Development proposals for shopfronts must 
apply inclusive and safe design principles. They 
should retain and wherever possible enhance 
street level access and entrances, including 
access to upper floor residential, commercial 
and community uses.

5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNExplanation
5.85 Lewisham’s high streets and shopping areas, 
including their shopfronts, are an important and 
highly valued part of our local neighbourhoods 
and often reflect the unique character and 
historical development of the Borough. 
5.86 Development proposals should ensure that 
shopfronts of good architectural quality or those 
with historic value are retained, refurbished or 
reinstated wherever possible. Where retention is 
not possible, replacements should be designed 
to a high quality standard using materials which 
are appropriate to the period and character of 
the building. Consideration should be given to 
shopfront framework features including pilasters, 
brackets, fascias and projecting signs. This is 
especially important where development of a 
shopfront would impact on the significance of a 
heritage asset or its setting, for example, within 
a Conservation Area or part of a Listed Building. 
Applicants are advised to refer the Council’s 
Conservation Area Appraisals and Shopfront 
Design Guide SPD for further information.
5.87 All shopfronts should be designed to a high 
quality standard, using materials and treatments 
that are sensitive to the character of the host 
building and neighbourhood. The standardisation 
in much of current shop design can gradually 
devalue the character and individual qualities of 
buildings in shopping areas. It is important that 
the design and materials of new and replaced 
shopfronts relate well to the scale of the building 
and its surrounds, as well as the original features 
of the building where these contribute positively 
to local character.5.88 The design and quality of shopfronts can be 
maintained by referring to the architecture of 
the host building and high quality shopfronts 
in comparable neighbouring units, and by 
reflecting the general scale and pattern of 
shopfronts in the area. New shopfronts should 
contribute towards a cohesive streetscape, retain 
a consistent building line and contribute to the 
character of the centre or parade it is located in. 
The detailing, quality of materials, execution and 
finishes are very important in shopfront design, 
particularly as they are viewed close-up.
5.89 Contemporary shopfront designs will be 
supported in appropriate locations. All new 
and altered shopfronts should apply inclusive 
and safe design principles. If a shopfront is 
replaced or altered, the design should respect the 
characteristics of the host building and, where 
appropriate, shopfront windows and framework 
features should be retained or restored.
5.90 Shopfronts with bulky and crudely attached, 
fully internal illuminated box fascias and intrusive 
signage add to visual clutter and detract from the 
quality and character of the townscape. Whilst 
internally illuminated box fascia signs may be 
acceptable in some locations, their use should 
be avoided in residential areas where amenity 
can be adversely impacted, as well as locations 
that would result in harm to the street scene or 
significance of a heritage asset or its setting.
1265.91 Shopfront security features should not have a 
detrimental impact on the townscape and local 
character. The use of solid external security 
shutters and grilles can create an unpleasant 
atmosphere when premises are closed, creating 
or perpetuating fears to personal safety. The 
use of open mesh security shutters and boxes is 
encouraged where such measures are considered 
necessary. Security features should be designed 
so that they can be hidden behind the fascia in 
order to reduce visual clutter from the frontage 
and townscape.
5.92 Development proposals for mixed-use schemes 
involving the creation of a new shopfront 
must provide a reasonable shopfront fit out, 
having regard to viability. This will encourage 
the occupation of business units and reduce 
the likelihood of vacancy, which can adversely 
impact on town centre vitality. Proposals should 
therefore provide appropriate level of shopfront 
design detail.

including by way of excessive illumination 
and visual intrusion of light pollution into 
adjoining or neighbouring properties and 
public spaces;
e. There is no adverse impact on public or 
highway safety; and
f. There is no harmful impact on trees, 
especially those with Tree Protection Orders 
(TPOs).

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
5 HIGH QUALITY DESIGNExplanation
5.93 Outdoor advertisements, digital displays and 
hoardings are a means of providing information 
to the public and can play a complementary role 
in supporting the local economy. Poorly sited, 
designed and maintained installations can have 
an adverse impact on public health and safety, 
amenity and local character. We will seek to 
ensure that all such development is designed to a 
high quality standard and secures safe, accessible 
and attractive environments.
5.94 Advertisements, digital displays and hoardings 
are regularly located on or adjacent to the public 
realm. To ensure that everyone can move safely 
and easily within it, development must apply 
inclusive and safe design principles. Where 
installations are proposed to be located on 
or adjacent to the Transport for London Road 
Network TfL should be consulted for an opinion 
on the safe operation of the highway network.
5.95 In the interests of protecting amenity proposals 
must address the impact that installations will 
have on surrounding uses and properties. For 
example, development should not obscure the 
views of occupants inside buildings, obscure 
elevations which contribute to the appearance 
of the townscape, or cause visual harm to parts 
of windows, cornices and other significant 
architectural features. Proposals for hoardings 
should seek to add visual interest while they are 
in place, such as by incorporating public art.
5.96 Applications for advertisements and hoardings 
are required to follow the Town and Country 
Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) 
Regulations 2007.

identified as a heritage asset. The Council will 
consider the significance of the asset and the 
impact of the proposals on its special interest. 
Any harm should be clearly and convincingly 
justified, and will be weighed against the 
public benefit of the proposal.
C Proposals for works that could impact on a 
heritage asset are required to be accompanied 
by a Heritage Statement. This should be 
compiled with reference to relevant and 
available sources of historic environment 
information, including Conservation Area

a. Explain the significance of the asset and its 
setting;
b. Set out how the asset has informed the 
design of the proposal; and
c. Assess the impact of the proposal on the 
asset.
D Where a development proposal conflicts 
with the Development Plan but will secure 
the preservation of a heritage asset that is 
otherwise not financially viable to repair, the 
Council will assess whether the benefits of the 
proposal outweigh the disbenefits of departing 
from those policies.

6 HERITAGEExplanation
6.1 Lewisham has an extremely rich and varied 
historic environment. It encompasses landscapes, 
water bodies, parks and open spaces, buildings, 
urban spaces and the features within them, 
along with archaeological remains both buried 
and above ground. The historic environment 
encapsulates the social and cultural history of 
Lewisham, its communities and people. This is 
reflected in the physical fabric of places, the 
values that people ascribe to them and the 
traditions and memories associated with them. 
Their value may be historic, architectural or 
artistic, social and communal.
6.2 We are committed to ensuring that the full 
extent of the significance of heritage assets 
is understood, both by development industry 
stakeholders and the wider public, and to 
properly recognise and protect this significance. 
This is vital to the successful delivery of the 
spatial strategy for the Borough. As Lewisham’s 
places evolve over time it is imperative that our 
irreplaceable heritage assets are appropriately 
preserved and the distinctive characteristics that 
make them special are retained and revealed.
6.3 The Council will continue to seek to identify new 
heritage assets to broaden public  understanding 
and appreciation of the historic environment. 
Heritage assets may be identified through 
Borough-wide reviews, through nomination by 
members of the community or by the Council 
when assessing planning applications. The 
Council’s approach to all newly identified assets 
is:
1. To identify the nature and extent of the asset;
2. To assess its architectural, historic and 
archaeological significance against adopted 
criteria; and3. If it meets the adopted criteria, undertake public 
consultation on the proposal to designate as a 
Conservation Area, identify as an Area of Special 
Local Character, or add it to the Local List, as 
appropriate.
6.4 In planning policy terms the Borough’s heritage 
assets comprise of statutorily designated assets 
and non-designated assets, both of which make 
important contributions to the communities 
within which they are situated. The Local Plan 
seeks to ensure that these assets are preserved 
or enhanced over the long-term. As well as 
recognising the value of these assets in their own 
right, their conservation will support the vitality 
and local distinctiveness of places across the 
Borough, and to help instil and reinforce a sense 
of place amongst residents and visitors.
6.5 Conservation is an active and continual process 
of maintenance and managing change based on a 
thorough understanding of what is special about 
a place. It requires a multi-agency approach to 
deliver beneficial outcomes. Our expectation is 
that key stakeholders including community and 
special interest groups and the development 
industry will all positively engage in the 
conservation process. Collaboration is necessary 
to deliver our growth and regeneration objectives 
whilst also ensuring Lewisham’s historic 
environment can continue to be celebrated and 
enjoyed, both by current and future generations.
6.6 All development proposals should be based on a 
full understanding of the significance of heritage 
assets within the site and surrounding area.  This 
should be established by reference to relevant 
and available sources of historic environment 
information. This includes the Greater London 
136Historic Environment Record, the Council’s 
planning and conservation webpages and 
Lewisham’s Local History Archives. Applicants 
should consult good practice guidance to assist 
in assessing various levels of significance, such 
as that produced by Historic England. We will 
expect all development proposals to identify and 
respond positively to those elements that are 
of high, moderate and low historic significance 
and those elements that detract from the 
significance.
6.7 All development proposals that are likely to have 
an impact on a heritage asset or its setting must 
be accompanied by a Heritage Statement. The 
statement should clearly explain the significance 
of the asset and its setting, set out how this has 
guided the design of the proposal, and assess 
how the proposal impacts upon it. Applicants 
will be expected to demonstrate how these 
findings have meaningfully informed the design 
of the proposal. The quality, accuracy and 
comprehensiveness of the heritage statement will 
be considered in the determination of planning 
applications.
6.8 Not all heritage assets are currently known, 
documented or fully understood.   Buildings, 
structures or sites may be identified as non-
designated heritage assets through the 
development process. For example, new 
information may be revealed by local groups 
through the consultation process or during 
preliminary site investigations undertaken by an 
applicant. In these circumstances we may seek 
amendments to proposals to ensure that the 
significance of an asset is appropriately preserved 
or enhanced.6.9 Proposals affecting heritage assets should be 
of the highest architectural and urban design 
quality, having regard to and respecting local 
character and complying with other policies 
in this plan. Heritage should be considered 
as an integral component of sustainable 
neighbourhoods and communities and must 
meaningfully inform the design of development. 
Development proposals that appropriately 
preserve or help to better reveal and enhance 
heritage assets and their setting will be 
supported, subject to meeting other policy 
requirements.
6.10 Proposals that may cause harm to the 
significance of heritage assets should be 
clearly and convincingly justified through the 
information provided in the Heritage Statement. 
Where the loss or harm to a heritage asset 
is suitably justified and planning consent is 
granted, a programme of building recording of 
a level appropriate to the significance of the 
building and the extent of loss may be required. 
Such measures will help to mitigate impacts of 
development and will normally be sought by way 
of a planning condition.
6.11 Where there is evidence of deliberate neglect or 
damage to a heritage asset, the current condition 
of the asset will not be taken into account in 
planning decisions.
6.12 We strongly advise applicants to seek the advice 
of specialist historic environment consultants 
at an early stage of the design process. This will 
help to ensure that the significance of heritage 
assets likely to be affected is appropriately 
identified. Applicants will then be better placed 
to consider options for bespoke and sensitive, 
137
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
6 HERITAGEheritage-led design solutions that respond to 
this significance. Specialist consultants can also 
advise on and provide the necessary information 
to support an application.
6.13 To support conservation objectives through 
the development management process the 
Council may use powers available to it. This 
includes the use of Article 4 Directions to 
remove permitted development rights, along 
with the use of Section 215 notices, Urgent 
Works or repair notices where this would help 
achieve conservation objectives.  The use of such 
powers may be appropriate where there is a risk 
to historic fabric or the appearance of an area.  
There are Article 4 Directions in place for many 
of the Borough’s Conservation Areas, and we 
will investigate the scope for introducing these 
elsewhere.
6.14 Historic England maintains a Heritage at 
Risk register to assist in the monitoring 
and management of Listed Buildings and 
conservation areas that are at risk of losing 
their special interest. The Council has statutory 
authority to intervene when there is evidence of 
serious neglect, including Urgent Works Notices 
to secure works to vacant listed buildings or 
unlisted buildings in conservation areas and has 
powers of inspection.
6.15 The NPPF sets out policies for ‘enabling 
development’. This is a term specifically used for 
cases where the cost of repair - and conversion to 
optimum viable use, if appropriate - of a heritage 
asset exceeds its market value on completion 
of repair or conversion, allowing for appropriate 
development costs (termed a ‘conservation 
deficit)’. In these cases development proposals which depart from the Development Plan and 
would normally be considered unacceptable may 
be permitted in order to secure the conservation 
of the asset.
6.16 Enabling development should not harm the 
heritage asset it is intended to conserve.  The 
Council will expect that measures have been fully 
explored and undertaken prior to considering 
enabling development. This may include 
maintenance, repair and decay-prevention 
measures, grant-funding for repairs and reuse, 
transfer of ownership to a building preservation 
trust or similar charity, and other sympathetic 
measures.  Development proposals for enabling 
development must submit full financial viability 
details and will be assessed having regard to the 
criteria set out in Historic England’s advice note 
GPA4 Enabling Development and Heritage Assets 
(2020).

142Explanation
Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site 
Buffer Zone
6.17 World Heritage Sites are designated heritage 
assets of the highest order. The UNESCO declared 
Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site is 
located adjacent to the northeast boundary of 
Lewisham. Its ‘Buffer Zone’ stretches into the 
Borough covering a part of Blackheath, as shown 
on the Policies Map.
6.18 As stated in the Maritime Greenwich World 
Heritage Site Management Plan (2014), a Buffer 
Zone is an area surrounding a World Heritage Site 
which has complementary legal and/or customary 
restrictions placed on its use and development to 
give an added layer of protection to the site. This 
should include the immediate setting of the site, 
important views and other areas or attributes that 
are functionally important as a support to the site 
and its protection. This includes continuation of 
the Grand Axis from the World Heritage site to 
All Saints Blackheath Church and the openness 
of the heath, which the Local Plan broadly 
seeks to maintain and enhance. Blackheath’s 
open character, and drama of approach, both 
support the Outstanding Universal Value of the 
Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site and its 
designation as a Conservation Area. UNESCO has 
identified the main threats to the World Heritage 
Site, which include development pressures within 
the town that could impact adversely on its urban 
grain and from tall buildings, in the setting, which 
may have the potential to impact adversely on 
its visual integrity. The Buffer Zone is therefore 
considered inappropriate for tall buildings. 
The London Plan states that further planning 
guidance will be prepared on settings and buffer 
zones, which will support implementation of this 
policy.Conservation Areas
6.19 Conservation Areas play an important role in 
shaping local urban character and identity. 
The Council has a statutory duty to preserve 
the character of Conservation Areas under 
Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Building and 
Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Conservation Area 
designation should not preclude appropriately 
located and sensitively designed development 
from coming forward. Indeed, the emphasis on 
Conservation Area management is to ensure that 
new development positively contributes to the 
area in which it is situated.
6.20 Lewisham’s Conservation Areas are areas of 
high townscape value that hold particular 
significance in the story of the Borough’s historic 
development and which underpin its distinctive 
local character. Applicants are strongly advised to 
refer the Council’s Conservation Area Appraisals 
early in the planning and design stage. The 
appraisals should be the starting point for 
understanding the significance of a site, building, 
structure or other feature and the contribution it 
makes to the surrounding area. We will continue 
a rolling programme of producing and updating 
character appraisals for each of the Borough’s 
Conservation Areas.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
6 HERITAGE6.21 The character of a Conservation Area can depend 
heavily on the cohesiveness of form, consistency 
of materials and detailing of buildings. The 
alteration or loss of one individual feature to a 
building may appear minor in the wider context, 
but incrementally such small changes can erode 
the special interest of an area. We have made 
Article 4 Directions to a number of Conservation 
Areas to help prevent the loss of important and 
distinctive features, and will continue to do this 
where it is considered necessary.
6.22 We strongly encourage the reinstatement of 
original or other features that make a positive 
contribution to a Conservation Area. Such works 
can help to enhance or better reveal the area’s 
significance. This includes the reinstatement or 
repair of features such as front boundary walls 
and fences, front garden soft landscaping and 
missing architectural detailing.
6.23 Not all elements of a Conservation Area 
contribute to its significance. Some buildings or 
features can have a negative or neutral impact. 
The adaptive re-use of redundant buildings 
and new infill development on disused land or 
under-utilised sites can represent an opportunity 
for enhancement. We will therefore support in 
principle such redevelopment where this will 
positively impact on and improve local character.Listed Buildings
6.24 The Council has a duty to preserve the character 
of Listed Buildings under Section 66 of the 
Planning (Listed Building and Conservation 
Areas) Act 1990. We will seek to ensure that 
the significance of a Listed Building is not 
harmed through inappropriate development to 
it, to structures or features in its curtilage, or 
by new development in its setting.  Proposals 
will need to be informed by an understanding 
of the significance of a Listed Building and its 
wider setting, irrespective of whether works are 
proposed to the Listed Building itself. Planning 
permission and/or listed building consent will 
only be granted where the relevant requirements 
are satisfied.
6.25 The best way of securing the upkeep of historic 
buildings and areas is to keep them in active use. 
It is recognised that buildings and structures will 
often necessitate some degree of adaptation. 
The range and acceptability of proposed uses 
must therefore be a major consideration, 
particularly where Listed Buildings are concerned. 
The conversion of Listed Buildings to new or 
different uses can result in harmful impacts to 
the building’s significance. This is due to works 
to the historic fabric (for instance related to the 
insertion of new service routes, vents and ducts) 
or plan form (for instance subdividing floor 
spaces to create additional units).
1446.26 We will seek to ensure that extensions and 
other works or alterations to Listed Buildings 
are restricted to the less significant parts of the 
building. Proposals will be required to provide 
full details of the development or associated 
works. This is in order that the impacts can be 
appropriately assessed. This must include details 
of any ancillary works of servicing, extraction, 
fire separation, access, and sound and thermal 
insulation. In many cases non-standard approaches 
and materials will be necessary to respond 
sensitively to the historic building fabric and form.  
The cumulative impact of works that, in isolation, 
may cause only minor harm will also be considered.
6.27 Where development in the curtilage of a Listed 
Building is justified by the applicant as necessary 
to ensure its future viability or repair, and/or is 
classed as enabling development, full financial 
viability details will be required to be submitted.
Scheduled Ancient Monuments
6.28 The effect of a proposal on the archaeological 
value or special interest of a scheduled ancient 
monument is a material consideration in 
determining a planning application.
6.29 The best way to avoid loss of significance of 
buried archaeological remains is to preserve them 
in situ.  Where this cannot be done, provision for 
excavation and recording will be required to be 
undertaken prior to development, or required by 
condition during development.6.30 Lewisham has one Scheduled Ancient Monument, 
the Tudor Naval Storehouse in the former 
Royal Naval Shipyard, Deptford, now known 
as Convoys Wharf. Following investigations in 
the 20th century, the archaeological interest of 
the Dockyard and adjacent Sayes Court Manor 
site as a whole was recognised by the Secretary 
of State to be of equivalent significance to a 
scheduled monument, and therefore the whole 
site should be considered subject to the policies 
for designated heritage assets, as required by 
NPPF footnote 63.
Registered Parks and Gardens and London 
Squares
6.31 The inclusion of a site on the Register of Parks 
and Gardens or listed as a London Square 
is a material consideration in determining a 
planning application. The significance of the site 
includes the contribution made by boundary 
walls, buildings and features within it, as well 
as historic landscaping schemes and planting.  
Social, cultural and artistic values are likely to 
be important alongside historic and architectural 
values. London Squares will be included on the 
Policies Map.

6 HERITAGEFigure 6.2: Non-designated Heritage Assets
146HE3 Non-designated heritage assets
Locally listed buildings and other non-
designated assets
A Development proposals will only be 
supported where they preserve or enhance 
the significance of a locally listed building 
or other non-designated heritage asset, and 
the asset’s setting. In particular, proposals for 
the sensitive retention, refurbishment and 
appropriate re-use of non-designated assets 
will be considered favourably.
B Proposals that unjustifiably harm the 
significance of a non-designated heritage 
asset and its setting will be refused.
C Non-designated heritage assets may 
be identified during the development 
management process, in line with Policy HE1 
(Lewisham’s historic environment).
 Areas of Special Local Character
D Within Areas of Special Local Character 
development proposals must:
a. Preserve the characteristics that contribute 
to the area’s significance, which may include 
the spatial, architectural, townscape, 
landscape or archaeological distinctiveness;
b. Secure the retention of unlisted buildings 
where these contribute positively to the 
local distinctiveness of the area; and
c. Ensure development in its setting preserves 
the area’s special local character.Archaeology
E Development proposals affecting archaeological 
interests will be assessed having regard to the 
impact on the significance of the archaeological 
asset and its setting. Development proposals 
should refer to the Greater London Historic 
Environment Record (GLHER) to assess the 
likelihood of archaeological deposits being 
present on a site.   Known areas with high 
likelihood of archaeological deposits are 
identified as Archaeological Priority Areas 
(APAs).
F In order to ensure assets are appropriately 
identified and managed the Council will:
a. Require the necessary level of assessment, 
investigation and recording, in consultation 
with the Greater London Archaeological 
Advisory Service (GLAAS) for development 
proposals that affect, or have the potential to 
affect Lewisham’s archaeological heritage; and 
b. Expect applicants to have sought pre-
application advice from GLAAS before 
designing a programme of archaeological 
investigation. .
147
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
6 HERITAGEG Development proposals that have the potential 
to affect archaeological interests must be 
accompanied by an Archaeological Statement, 
which should be submitted as part of the 
Heritage Statement and refer to any relevant 
information in the GLHER. With the advice 
of GLAAS, the Council may require a further 
site specific survey and/or intervention. 
This should be set out in a Written Scheme 
of Investigation which ensures adequate 
arrangements for:
a. Investigation, recording, and archiving 
of assets of archaeological importance, 
whether of national or local importance;
b. Seeking opportunities to integrate 
archaeological evidence into the 
development, including through design and 
interpretation material; and
c. Public engagement, including dissemination 
of the findings to further understanding of 
the historic environment.
H Priority should be given to the preservation 
and management of an archaeological asset 
and its setting in situ, commensurate with the 
significance of the asset. If this is not possible, 
sites should be excavated, deposits removed, 
a report produced, significant finds archived 
and the results disseminated, as required by 
condition. 
I As remains may on occasion come to 
light unexpectedly, the Council may use 
conditions to require notification, recording 
or preservation in the event of remains being 
found.
148Explanation
6.32 Non-designated heritage assets include Locally 
Listed buildings and structures, Areas of Special 
Local Character, Archaeological deposits, 
including known areas of high archaeological 
interest known as Archaeological Priority Areas 
(APAs), buildings structures and features within 
conservation areas that are identified to make 
a positive contribution, unlisted historic street 
furniture, local parks and gardens of historic 
interest (which are not Registered), historic 
townscapes and buildings of townscape merit.
6.33 Lewisham contains many buildings and 
structures that are not statutorily listed but are 
nonetheless of special historic, architectural, 
townscape, social or cultural interest in their local 
area, and greatly contribute to the Borough’s 
distinctiveness and sense of place. The Council 
has a rolling programme of evaluating and 
recognising their importance and value, through 
periodic reviews and updates of the Local List. 
6.34 Areas of Special Local Character are places 
where there is a coherent local character, often 
based on townscape, architecture and spatial 
qualities. Their significance will normally rest on 
the combined qualities of groups of elements 
rather than the value of the elements taken 
individually. Twelve Areas of Special Local 
Character are currently recognised, as set out in 
Schedule 3. These areas will be assessed against 
Historic England’s guidance for conservation 
area designation and, if they are of sufficient 
historic or architectural interest, will be consulted 
upon and adopted as Conservation Areas. If 
they do not meet the level of interest expected 
for Conservation Area designation but still 
demonstrate other aspects of local interest (for 
instance artistic, landscape, social and cultural) they will continue to be considered of special 
interest to the Borough and will be formalised as 
Areas of Special Local Character. Selection criteria 
for assessing potential new Areas of Special Local 
Character will be adopted by the Council in due 
course, and any proposed new areas will then be 
assessed against them.
6.35 The Council maintains a ‘live’ list of non-
designated heritage assets that have been 
identified but have not yet been assessed and 
these are reviewed and updated from time to 
time.
Archaeology
6.36 Lewisham is particularly rich in known areas of 
archaeological interest, dating to the prehistoric, 
Roman and medieval periods. The areas of 
greatest known archaeological interest or 
where there is above average potential for new 
discoveries are identified by Archaeological 
Priority Areas (APAs).  Lewisham’s APA 
boundaries date from the 1970s-1980s and 
do not predict the likelihood that currently 
unidentified heritage assets, particularly sites 
of historic and archaeological interest, will be 
discovered in the future, as required by NPPF . 
They will be reviewed and updated in due 
course by Historic England and a London-
wide standardised approach, as defined within 
London Plan paragraph 7.1.10 will be used 
which assigns all land in the borough to one of 
four tiers denoting different levels of sensitivity 
to development, using an ‘archaeological risk’ 
model.  Therefore developers should consider 
the potential for archaeological discoveries both 
within and outside the existing APA boundaries. 
149
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
6 HERITAGE6.37 Development should avoid harm to or loss of 
archaeological deposits of significance and any 
harm will require justification. Developments 
that have the potential to affect archaeological 
interests include subterranean development 
and some alterations to historic buildings. 
Archaeological remains of local importance 
should be preserved in situ unless the public 
benefits of the development outweigh the loss 
of the remains. Where it is suitably demonstrated 
that archaeological remains cannot be preserved 
in situ the Council will require that the remains 
are appropriately excavated, recorded, archived, 
published, interpreted and displayed through 
a detailed planned programme of works. There 
may also be a requirement for a programme 
of public engagement in order that the results 
of significant archaeological discoveries are 
disseminated. The scale of public engagement 
will be based upon on the significance and 
interest of what is found, and may involve site 
visits for the public or other means of on-site and 
off-site viewing.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE154HO1 Meeting Lewisham’s housing needs
Lewisham’s housing target
A The Council will work positively and proactively 
with stakeholders, including development 
industry partners, to facilitate a significant 
increase in the delivery of new homes to help 
meet Lewisham’s housing needs. Development 
proposals must make the best use of land and 
optimise the capacity of housing sites in order 
to ensure:
a. The London Plan ten-year target is exceeded 
through the delivery of at least 16,670 net 
housing completions during 2019/2020 to 
2028/2029 (equivalent to 1,667 p.a.); and
b. The NPPF 15-year target is exceeded 
through the delivery of at least 27,730 net 
housing completions from the anticipated 
start date of the local plan, 2023/24 
to 2037/38 (equivalent to 1,667 net 
completions p.a. plus additional completions 
during the first five years to cater for 
the current backlog (461 p.a.) and the 
application of a 5% buffer (83 p.a.)).
B The Council will keep under review the Local 
Plan’s strategic housing target and performance 
against the delivery of this. Where changes to 
the London Plan borough-level housing targets 
are made the local plan review process will be 
used to ensure Lewisham’s Local Plan remains 
in general conformity with the London Plan.
Increasing housing supply
C A carefully managed uplift in the delivery of 
new housing development across the Borough, 
with priority given to genuinely affordable 
housing, will be achieved by:a. Directing new housing development 
to Opportunity Areas, Growth Nodes, 
Regeneration Nodes, Growth Corridors, 
town centres and other well-connected and 
sustainable locations, consistent with the 
spatial strategy for the Borough set out in 
Policy OL1 (Delivering an Open Lewisham);
b. Allocating strategic sites for new housing, 
including mixed-use development, and 
supporting development proposals where 
they comply with the site allocation 
requirements and resisting proposals that 
are at odds with these;
c. Facilitating the sensitive intensification of 
established residential areas and supporting 
the development of small sites for housing, 
in line with Policy HO2 (Optimising the use 
of small sites);
d. Undertaking a programme of housing estate 
maintenance, renewal and regeneration 
that ensures high quality housing provision, 
results in no net loss of affordable housing 
and delivers net gains in affordable housing 
wherever possible;
e. Ensuring that all development proposals 
make the best use of land and optimise the 
capacity of housing sites, in line with Policy 
QD6 (Optimising site capacity);
f. Making the best use of the existing housing 
stock, including by using available tools 
to bring vacant units back into use and to 
regulate the use of homes for short-stay 
visitor accommodation; 
g. Refusing development proposals that will 
result in the net loss of housing unless:
h. It is suitably replaced at existing or higher 
densities with at least the equivalent 
amount of new residential floorspace; or
Opposite: Marine Wharf

7 HOUSINGi. The proposal is for strategic infrastructure 
that demonstrably meets an identified need 
and is necessary to support delivery of the 
spatial strategy for the Borough; and
ii. Ensuring the phasing of development 
corresponds with the delivery of 
infrastructure required to support growth 
and to speed up the rate of delivery of new 
homes where planning consent has been 
granted.
Inclusive and mixed neighbourhoods and 
communities
D Development proposals for housing must 
demonstrate how they will contribute to and 
support inclusive and mixed neighbourhoods and 
communities across Lewisham. Details should be 
set out in the Inclusive Design Statement which 
must be submitted in accordance with Policy QD2 
(Inclusive and Safe Design).
E Development proposals must deliver an 
appropriate mix of housing within the site 
and local area. The appropriate mix should be 
established on a case-by-case basis having regard 
to the site’s location and character,  the nature 
and scale of development proposed, along with:
a. The strategic target for 50 per cent of all new 
homes delivered in the Borough to be for 
genuinely affordable housing;
b. The required mix of tenure types for affordable 
housing, with reference to Policy HO 3 
(Genuinely affordable housing); 
c. The need to secure provision of a mix of unit 
sizes to meet local need, with reference to the 
target unit size mix for affordable housing set 
out Table 7.1 ; 
d. The need for provision of family housing units (3+ bedrooms), with a reasonable 
proportion of family units to be delivered 
on major developments of 10 or more 
dwellings; and
e. The delivery of liveable and sustainable 
neighbourhoods that are appropriately 
supported by community facilities and other 
infrastructure.
F Development proposals comprising solely of 
studios and/or 1 bedroom, 1 person units, or 
those that will result in an overconcentration 
of 1 or 2 bedroom units on an individual 
site , will be refused unless it can be suitably 
demonstrated that the housing provision:
a. Is located in an area with higher Public 
Transport Access Levels (i.e. PTAL 3-6); and
b. Forms part of a larger development, 
or is located within an area for which a 
masterplan has been adopted or endorsed 
by the Council, that includes provision for 
a mix of unit sizes, including a reasonable 
amount of family-sized units (3+ 
bedrooms); or
c. Is sited in a local area that consists 
predominantly of family housing units, and 
would therefore provide for a balance in the 
mix of unit sizes in the area; or
d. Is the only housing format deliverable 
owing to site size, site configuration 
or other development constraints, and 
where a studio unit is proposed, it is of an 
exceptional design quality.
Housing choice 
G To help ensure that local residents and other 
people have access to a wide range of suitable 
156Table 7.1: Target unit size mix for affordable housing
 housing provision, the Council will:
a. Seek that development delivers a wide range 
of genuinely affordable and other housing 
products, including market housing, to meet 
the needs of households of different sizes 
and income levels;
b. Support development proposals that meet 
the needs of specific groups including: 
families with children, older people, people 
with disabilities, students and vulnerable 
people; 
c. Promote and support innovative housing 
designs, such as modular housing, particularly 
where these address acute or specialist local 
housing needs; 
d. Support appropriate proposals for self-build 
or custom build housing, and seek to identify 
land to help facilitate such development 
where a need is clearly established; and
e. Encourage developers and agents to market 
new housing units for sale or rent to existing 
local residents and people with a local 
connection before advertising them more 
widely to others.
H Development proposals for Build to Rent 
housing will be assessed in accordance with 
London Plan policy H11 (Build to Rent). They 
must demonstrate that all such provision 
qualifies as Build to Rent by meeting the criteria 
set out in London Plan. Where the criteria are 
not met proposals will not be considered as 
Build to Rent and will be assessed against other 
relevant Local Plan policies.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
7 HOUSINGExplanation
Lewisham’s strategic housing target
7.1 The London Plan sets out the challenge facing all 
London boroughs to deliver a significant increase 
in housing to meet current and future needs 
across the Capital. The London-wide Strategic 
Housing Market Assessment (SHMA), which 
informed the preparation of the London Plan, 
identifies a need for some 66,000 additional 
homes per year to be delivered across London. 
To accommodate this need for housing the 
London Mayor advocates for fundamentally new 
approaches to housing delivery. The London 
Plan policies seek to achieve a significant uplift 
in housing across the region. They are set in the 
context of the limited availability of developable 
land in a highly urbanised, world city and the 
competing pressures for different land uses. 
The policies also respond to the need for major 
investment in strategic infrastructure, particularly 
public transport, to support housing growth on 
this scale and to unlock the full development 
potential of areas and sites.
7.2 In order to address the identified housing needs 
for the region, the London Plan sets out 10-year 
housing targets. It then directs local authorities 
to include the relevant borough-level targets 
within their local plans. Boroughs are also 
required to set a positive planning framework to 
meet and wherever possible exceed the London 
Plan housing targets. For Lewisham, the 10-year strategic housing target for the period 2019/2020 
to 2028/2029 is 16,670 net housing completions 
(equivalent to 1,667 net completions p.a.). The 
London Plan does not set housing targets past this 
period however it provides a direction for borough 
local plans where targets are needed beyond 202948 
. In light of this direction and local evidence on land 
availability, it is considered appropriate for the Local 
Plan to ‘roll-forward’ the borough’s London Plan 
annual housing target. This will also ensure that 
the NPPF requirement to identify land for homes 
is satisfied49 . Accordingly, the 5-year target from 
the anticipated start date of the plan in 2023/24 
– is 11,060 and the 15-year target is 27,730 net 
housing completions.  This is equivalent to 1,667 net 
completions p.a. plus additional completions during 
the first five years to cater for the current backlog 
(462 p.a.) and to provide a 5% buffer (83 p.a.).
7.3 To help inform the preparation of the Local Plan the 
Council has undertaken an assessment to identify 
sources of land that may be suitable and available 
for housing development, including:
• A comprehensive review of land and sites available 
for development in the Borough, including by 
participating in the London-wide SHLAA;
• Undertaking of several ‘call for sites’ exercises 
inviting the public, including landowners, developers 
and agents, to help identify sites that might be 
suitable for different types of development;
• A Metropolitan Open Land Review to understand 
how the Borough’s MOL is performing and whether 
there is scope to release any parts of this land to 
other uses, including for housing;47 London Plan (2021), paragraph 4.1.11 states that “If 
a target is needed beyond the 10 year period (2019/20 
to 2028/29), boroughs should draw on the 2017 SHLAA 
findings (which cover the plan period to 2041) and any 
local evidence of identified capacity, in consultation with 
the GLA, and should take into account any additional 
capacity that could be delivered as a result of any 
committed transport infrastructure improvements, and roll 
forward the housing capacity assumptions applied in the 
London Plan for small sites.48 NPPF (2021), paragraph 68 provides that the Local 
Plan should identify specific, deliverable sites for year 1-5 
and specific developable sites for years 6-10 and where 
possible years 11-15. 
158• Scrutiny of potential development sites to 
establish whether they are deliverable and 
developable49, including through engagement 
with land owners during the plan’s preparation;
• Detailed assessments of the development 
capacity of potential development sites, taking 
into account the uplift in density and overall 
site capacity that could be achieved through 
the delivery of planned strategic transport 
infrastructure, particularly the Bakerloo line 
upgrade and extension to Hayes. 
7.4 The Local Plan identifies specific site allocations 
which have the potential capacity to deliver 
24,413 net new homes over the lifetime of the 
Plan. When combined with other large consented 
sites and the trend-based windfall delivery rates 
in the Borough, there will be sufficient capacity 
to exceed the 10 year London Plan target and 
the NPPF housing target over a five and 15-year 
period. However, the phasing of development 
will be an important consideration. There is a 
critical need for strategic transport infrastructure, 
particularly the Bakerloo line extension, to 
unlock the development potential of areas and 
to optimise the capacity of sites. A Housing 
Trajectory is included in an Appendix to the Local 
Plan which sets out details on the expected 
phasing of housing delivery over the plan period.
49 Deliverable and developable as defined by NPPF 
(2021), paragraph 67.
50 In line with NPPF (2021) paragraph 74 a 5% buffer 
has been applied to ensure choice and competition in the 
market for land.7.5 For the purpose of monitoring housing 
completions, net changes on conventional and 
non-conventional forms of housing will be 
calculated in line with the London Plan. For 
the avoidance of doubt, non-self-contained 
accommodation for students will be counted on 
a 2.5:1 ratio, with two and a half bedrooms/
units being counted as a single home. Non-self-
contained accommodation for older people (C2 
use class) will be counted on a 1:1 ratio, with each 
bedroom being counted as a single home. All other 
net non-self-contained communal accommodation 
will count towards meeting housing targets on 
the basis of a 1.8:1 ratio, with one point eight 
bedrooms/units being counted as a single home.
7.6 The Local Plan seeks to facilitate a carefully 
managed uplift in the delivery of new housing 
development across the Borough to meet local 
needs, with priority given to genuinely affordable 
housing. There are a number of different routes to 
increasing housing supply which reflect the varying 
scale of opportunities available. These range from 
enforcement action to bring vacant housing units 
back into use, the sensitive intensification of small 
sites, and more strategically, the comprehensive 
redevelopment of larger brownfield sites including 
those for which site allocations have been 
prepared. All such routes to housing delivery relate 
to the spatial strategy for the Borough, which aims 
to direct development in support of Good Growth. 
We will work with development industry partners 
and other stakeholders to identify opportunities to 
optimise the capacity of sites that are suitable for 
new housing, ensuring that development will be 
appropriately supported by infrastructure.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
7 HOUSINGInclusive and mixed neighbourhoods and 
communities
7.7 Lewisham is a diverse Borough comprising of 
many vibrant and distinctive neighbourhoods and 
communities, which makes it an exciting place to 
visit and live. However, it also ranks amongst the 
most deprived local authority areas in England 
with pockets of social and economic deprivation 
scattered across the Borough. The Council is 
committed to achieving inclusive and mixed 
communities by addressing the environmental, 
social and economic barriers adversely affect 
peoples’ lives. The Local Plan seeks to facilitate a 
significant uplift in housing and our expectation 
is that new development should respond to 
existing imbalances in provision, so to better 
meet local needs and contribute to sustainable 
neighbourhoods and communities. This policy 
sets the strategic approach for securing 
an appropriate mix of housing when new 
development comes forward.
7.8 There is a significant and acute need for more 
genuinely affordable housing in the Borough, as 
set out in the London Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment (2017) and Lewisham Strategic 
Housing Market Assessment Update (2022). 
Consistent with the London Plan, development 
proposals must contribute towards the 
Borough’s strategic target of 50 per cent of new 
homes to be genuinely affordable. Residential 
development proposals must maximise the 
amount of affordable housing on-site, subject 
to viability, having regard to the requirements 
in Policy HO 3 (Genuinely affordable housing). 
The strategic target is for delivery across the 
Borough recognising a number of sites are likely 
to make provision in excess of the target, such as those delivered by the Council through its 
housebuilding programme and by  registered 
providers. We will work proactively with partners 
and industry stakeholders, including private 
developers, to secure the delivery of more high 
quality and genuinely affordable housing.
7.9 Development proposals must respond to local 
need by securing a mix of dwelling sizes (in 
terms of occupancy measured by bed spaces), 
particularly family sized units (i.e. 3+ bedrooms). 
Development proposals for major residential 
development must make provision for a 
reasonable proportion of family housing units, 
the amount of which will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis taking into account financial 
viability. Minor development proposals of less 
than 10 units incorporating family sized units 
will be considered favourably. Development 
proposals should not normally result in the 
loss of family sized units (including through 
demolition and redevelopment); further details 
on the conversion of family housing is set out in 
Policy HO2 (Optimising the use of small housing 
sites). Where development proposals include 
an element of affordable housing, the unit size 
mix should be established with reference Table 
7.1. All development proposals will be expected 
to demonstrate how the dwelling size mix is 
appropriate to the site in contributing to inclusive 
and mixed neighbourhoods and communities. 
7.10 To help secure inclusive and mixed 
neighbourhoods and communities, we will resist 
development proposals that comprise solely of 
studios and 1 bedroom, 1 person units or those 
that will result in an overconcentration of 1 or 
2 bedroom units on a site or local area. London 
Plan policy H10 (Housing size mix) makes clear 
160that developments with a higher proportion 
of 1 and 2 bedroom units are generally more 
appropriate in locations which are closer to a 
town centre or station or with higher public 
transport access and connectivity. This policy 
is considered to provide sufficient flexibility 
to respond to individual site circumstances. 
For example, in situations where there are site 
development constraints or where proposals for 
such provision would demonstrably enhance the 
mix and balance of housing unit types within a 
larger development site or local area. Studio units 
intended for single person occupation are not 
considered to provide a long-term, sustainable 
solution to meeting local housing need. 
Development proposals for studio units may 
be permitted where they are of an exceptional 
design quality, minimum space standards are 
satisfied and the development is appropriately 
located in a well-connected and highly accessible 
location that benefits from good provision of 
local amenities.
Housing choice
7.11 The availability of a wide range of housing 
choices, with provision for a mix and balance of 
housing types, sizes and tenures is essential to 
the achievement of inclusive neighbourhoods 
and communities. We will generally support 
proposals that enhance housing choice and 
access to genuinely affordable housing in 
Lewisham. The Local Plan sets out additional 
policies that address the needs of different 
groups  including those who require specialised 
forms of housing. Further details are set out later 
in this section.
7.12 Lewisham is gaining a reputation as a location for 
innovative housing design with both public and private sector led developments winning or being 
recognised for design awards in recent years51.  
We are broadly supportive of development 
proposals applying innovative and contemporary 
designs where they comply with other Local Plan 
policies. Development proposals for housing as a 
meanwhile use will be considered with reference 
to Policy DM5 (Meanwhile uses).
7.13 Those with a connection to Lewisham, including 
people currently living or working locally or with 
family connections in the Borough should have 
a good opportunity to access new housing as it 
is made available on the private market.  We will 
therefore encourage developers and agents to 
advertise new units locally, ideally for a period of 
3 months, before marketing them more widely. 
Whilst the Council exercises no planning control 
in this respect, it will broadly support developers 
and agents in making a reasonable proportion 
of new residential units available to local 
residents, UK citizens and others with a strong 
connection to the Borough, particularly for owner 
occupation.
51 The Council’s Authority Monitoring Reports include 
information on design awards. Information is also available 
from professional bodies such as the Royal Institute of 
British Architects (RIBA).

7 HOUSING162Opposite: Infill by Selencky Parsons and Richard ChiversHO2 Optimising the use of small housing sites
A The development of small sites will play an 
important role in increasing housing supply in 
Lewisham and supporting provision for a wide 
range of high quality and affordable homes. 
Opportunities should be taken to optimise 
the capacity of small sites for new housing 
development across the Borough, including 
through:
a. Redevelopment of vacant and underused 
brownfield sites, and ancillary buildings 
such as garages;
b. Housing conversions;
c. Housing alterations and extensions; and 
d. Infill and backland development.
B To help facilitate the appropriate 
development of small sites for housing 
the Council has prepared the Small Sites 
SPD and the Alterations and Extensions 
SPD. Development proposals should have 
regard to this guidance, where relevant, and 
demonstrate how it has been used through 
the design-led approach.
C Development proposals for housing on small 
sites will only be supported where they 
help to facilitate the delivery of the spatial 
strategy for the Borough and:
a. Are appropriately located for residential 
use;
b. Are of a high quality design with 
accommodation that meets the relevant 
standards for living and amenity space, 
with reference to Policy QD8 (High quality 
housing design);c. Respond positively to local character, 
including historical character and heritage 
assets;
d. Protect and enhance biodiversity and 
green infrastructure, and further maximise 
opportunities for urban greening;
e. Make provision for affordable housing, in 
line with Policy HO3 (Genuinely affordable 
housing);
f. Protect and do not result in unreasonable 
adverse impacts on local amenity;
g. Do not result in the loss of community 
infrastructure, with reference to Policy CI1 
(Safeguarding and securing community 
infrastructure); and
h. Do not prejudice the delivery of site 
allocations in the Local Plan.
D Neighbourhood forums are strongly 
encouraged to identify locations and allocate 
sites appropriate for housing development, 
including small sites, within neighbourhood 
plans.
Housing conversions
E In order to maintain a supply of housing 
suitable for families, development proposals 
for the conversion of a single family dwelling, 
or self-contained unit with 3+ bedrooms, 
into smaller self-contained residential units 
(including flats) will only be supported where:
a. The gross internal floor space of the original 
dwelling is 130 sq. metres or greater;
b. A family sized unit (3+ bedrooms) is re-
provided, unless it is demonstrated that 
the property is not suitable for family 
accommodation due to environmental or 
other site constraints;
163
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
7 HOUSINGc. All housing units benefit from a layout and 
configuration that is practical for residential 
occupation, with reference to other policies 
on high quality design;
d. In the situation garden land or other 
dedicated private outdoor amenity space is 
available, the extent of and access to this 
private amenity space is maintained for the 
existing family unit, and wherever possible, 
made accessible to residents in other units; 
and
e. The development will not result in an 
adverse impact on local character.
F Development proposals for the conversion of 
properties into Houses in Multiple Occupation 
will be considered against Policy HO8 
(Housing with Shared Facilities - Houses in 
Multiple Occupation).

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
7 HOUSINGExplanation
7.14 The London Plan sets out a ‘small sites’ housing 
target for every borough. Small sites are defined 
as those that are less than 0.25 hectares. The 
small sites target is a component of, and not 
additional to, the overall housing target. For 
Lewisham, the small sites target for the ten-year 
period from 2019/20 is 3,790 net housing units, 
or 379 units per year. This is broadly in line with 
our monitoring of ‘windfall’ development on 
small sites in the Borough. The small sites target 
makes up roughly one-quarter of the borough’s 
London Plan housing target.
7.15 Through the Local Plan we are seeking to boost 
the delivery of small housing development 
beyond the historic delivery levels. Our aim is 
not only to meet the London Plan small sites 
target but to exceed it, recognising a variety 
of measures are needed to achieve the overall 
housing target and meet the range of housing 
needs of different groups in the Borough. 
This includes need for genuinely affordable 
housing. Through the development and sensitive 
intensification of small sites, there will be more 
opportunities to secure planning contributions 
that can be invested in the delivery of new 
affordable housing units. Furthermore, small 
sites can play an important role in addressing 
local deprivation. For instance, the designated 
Area for Regeneration in the south of the 
Borough, discussed in Part 3, has a distinctive 
character and urban grain based on its historic 
estate development. There is a lack of large 
site opportunities to generate investment in 
this area. Small site development provides a 
mechanism for more incremental investment and 
area improvement that can help to address the 
underlying causes of deprivation. In short, our 
positive approach to small site development is informed by the Local Plan’s strategic objectives, 
and is not simply a matter of housing numbers.
7.16 There are a variety of opportunities and types 
of small sites that can support new housing 
development. Vacant and underused brownfield 
sites along with redundant ancillary facilities, 
such as garages or residential storage units, 
present relatively straightforward options for 
redevelopment. However these types of sites are 
limited in availability and are often constrained, 
such as by irregular plot forms, site access issues 
or land-use designations (including those that 
protect land for commercial uses). It is therefore 
expected that the majority of small sites 
development will occur in established residential 
areas, where new homes can be sensitively 
integrated with other compatible uses. Housing 
development on small sites can take a number 
of forms including: new build, infill and backland 
development, conversion (subdivision of houses 
into flats), demolition and redevelopment 
Infill by 31/44-architects and Anna Stathaki
166or extension of existing buildings (including 
upward, rear and side extension, and basement 
development).
7.17 Our approach to housing development on small 
sites is expected to facilitate the incremental 
intensification of established residential areas, 
particularly where sites have a good Public 
Transport Access Level (PTAL 3-6) and/or they 
are within 800 metres of a station or Major/
District town centre. It is imperative that future 
growth and development occurs in a way that 
respects and enhances local character, with the 
distinctive features of Lewisham’s communities 
at the heart of the design-led approach. The 
Lewisham Characterisation Study (2019) 
identifies areas that are positioned to facilitate an 
uplift in small housing development, recognising 
that the physical character of some areas may 
need to evolve gradually over time, for example, 
to accommodate new housing and investment in 
infrastructure. The Characterisation Study defines 
areas on a spectrum of sensitivity to change, 
based on local character, taking into account 
factors such as existing urban grain, historic 
evolution, building typologies, and spatial 
strategic growth and regeneration priorities 
across the Borough. All proposals for small 
housing development will be expected to refer 
this document, as a starting point, to understand 
the scope for intensification in a given area and 
to gain an appreciation of the key features of 
local character. The Council has also prepared a 
Small Sites SPD to support the delivery of high 
quality housing. All development proposals for 
small sites must demonstrate how the SPD has 
been used to inform the design-led approach.7.18 Where small site housing development is 
proposed it should not have an unacceptable 
adverse impact on biodiversity and green 
infrastructure. Applications will be expected to 
identify potential impacts in this regard, and 
clearly set out measures to minimise and mitigate 
these. Measures may include the return of hard 
standing to green space, installation of green 
roofs and walls, and sustainable landscaping. In 
exceptional circumstances, where site constraints 
demonstrably preclude the implementation of 
on-site measures, then off-site provision (for 
example, tree planting) may be acceptable in 
order to ensure policy compliance. Off-site 
provision will be secured on a case-by-case 
basis through the use legal agreements and/or 
planning contributions.
7.19 This policy presents a new strategic approach to 
meeting housing need locally. An allowance for 
small site development has been made in the 
Local Plan housing trajectory. This sets out the 
expected rate of housing delivery over the plan 
period, based on past trends. We will monitor 
progress towards the small site housing target 
through the Authority Monitoring Report and 
consider this policy’s effectiveness through 
the Local Plan review process. Monitoring will 
also provide us with information to understand 
the spatial distribution of new small housing 
development and consider whether interventions 
are necessary, for example, to ensure those areas 
where this type of development is concentrated 
are appropriately supported by community 
facilities and other strategic infrastructure.

7 HOUSINGHousing conversions
7.20 The Local Plan seeks to ensure provision for 
a wide range of housing types and tenures to 
meet local need, including need arising from 
families. The conversion of larger and single 
family homes into flats has in recent years 
provided a small source of housing supply in 
Lewisham. Whilst recognising that conversions 
support delivery towards the strategic housing 
target, it is important that provision for family 
accommodation is not compromised. The Local 
Plan therefore sets out requirements to ensure 
that family sized units (3+ bedrooms) are 
retained when residential conversions come 
forward. TheLewisham SHMA (2022 shows there 
is an acute need for family housing.
7.21 There is a limited supply of family sized housing 
units in the Borough, with the SHMA indicating 
that 1 and 2 bedroom units comprise the 
majority of existing properties ( at 61 per cent, 
above the averages for London and England at 
56 and 41 per cent respectively). Furthermore, 
monitoring information demonstrates that the 
vast majority of recent new build residential 
development has been for flats or apartments, 
mainly 1 and 2 bedroom units, and it is 
anticipated that this trend will continue into the 
future. Development proposals must therefore 
ensure that existing family sized units are not 
unnecessarily lost through conversion. This policy 
is not considered to inhibit the achievement of 
the small sites housing target, as proposals will 
continue to be supported where adequate family 
sized units are retained or re-provided.7.22 Some flexibility may be applied on a case-by-
case basis where it can be suitably demonstrated 
that environmental or other site specific 
constraints make re-provision of a family sized 
unit inappropriate. This includes consideration 
of the site or building size (which might 
compromise achievement of the minimum 
space standards for a 3+ bedroom unit), lack 
of amenity space suitable for a family, or other 
environmental constraints that would adversely 
impact on occupants, particularly children and 
young people.
168HO3 Genuinely affordable housing
A The strategic target is for 50 per cent of 
all new homes delivered in Lewisham to be 
genuinely affordable. The Council will seek 
the maximum amount of genuinely affordable 
housing to be delivered on new housing 
developments. Development proposals 
that deliver high quality affordable housing 
through the Fast Track Route, as detailed in 
HO3.F below, to achieve a minimum 35 per 
cent affordable housing will be considered 
favourably. Development proposals involving 
new housing will only be supported where the 
site capacity has been optimised and delivery 
of affordable housing maximised.
B The affordable housing requirement will apply 
to all forms of conventional housing in the C3 
Use Class, unsecured student accommodation 
and, where appropriate, specialist and 
supported accommodation.  Affordable 
housing requirements for Purpose Built 
Student Accommodation are set out in Policy 
HO7 (Purpose Built Student Accommodation).
C The affordable housing requirements for 
major developments (large sites) will apply in 
circumstances where development has already 
been permitted and 10 or more dwelling units 
will be delivered taking into account:
a. New residential units that are proposed 
which would result in an uplift in the overall 
number of units on the site of the extant 
permission; andb. Development that is proposed on an 
adjacent site which by virtue of its layout, 
design and use is functionally related to the 
extant permission and would result in an 
uplift in the overall number of units across 
the sites.
D Applicants will be expected to make all 
reasonable efforts to secure grant funding 
to deliver an increase in affordable housing 
beyond the level that would otherwise be 
achievable. The Council will work positively 
with development industry partners to 
help identify opportunities to secure grant 
funding to deliver more genuinely affordable 
housing in Lewisham. Development proposals 
will be considered favourably where they 
demonstrably deliver the maximum viable 
amount of affordable housing whilst meeting 
the minimum threshold level of affordable 
housing without public subsidy, as set out in 
HO3.F, and secure grant funding to deliver 
provision of genuinely affordable housing 
additional to this level.
Large sites (major developments)
E Development proposals for new housing, 
including mixed-use developments, with site 
capacity to accommodate 10 or more dwelling 
units must deliver the maximum amount of 
genuinely affordable housing, taking into 
account: 
a. Their contribution to the Borough’s 
strategic affordable housing target, based 
on habitable rooms, subject to viability;
169
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
7 HOUSINGb. The need for provision of a mix of secure 
housing tenures, with the affordable 
component sought to be provided on 
the basis of a tenure split of 70 per 
cent genuinely affordable (social rent or 
London Affordable Rent) and 30 per cent 
intermediate (London Living Rent or shared 
ownership);
c. The preferred housing size mix for 
affordable housing, as set out in Table 7.1 ;
d. Availability of public subsidy; and
e. Other planning benefits that may be 
achieved, having particular regard to the 
delivery of the spatial strategy for the 
Borough.
F A threshold approach to viability will be 
applied to major development proposals, 
in accordance with London Plan policy H5 
(Threshold approach to applications), taking 
into account the different routes to affordable 
housing delivery (i.e. Fast Track Route and 
Viability Tested Route). In Lewisham, the 
threshold level of affordable housing on gross 
residential development is set at:
a. A minimum of 35 per cent; 
b. A minimum 50 per cent on public sector 
land; and
c. A minimum of 50 per cent for Strategic 
Industrial Locations and Locally Significant 
Industrial Sites where development would 
result in a net loss of industrial capacity.
G Where the Viability Tested Route is used, 
and in other circumstances where a Viability 
Assessment is submitted to support the level 
of affordable housing provision made by a 
development proposal, this must be based on a standard residual valuation approach, with the 
benchmark existing use value of the land taken 
as the Existing Use Value (EUV) Premium or the 
potential for Alternative Use Value52. In order to 
ensure transparency in the planning process the 
Viability Assessment must be undertaken in line 
with the Mayor’s Affordable Housing and Viability 
SPG or future equivalent.
H To maximise affordable housing delivery and 
address economic uncertainties that may arise 
over the lifetime of a development proposal the 
use of ‘review mechanisms’ will be required, where 
appropriate, and implemented in line with the 
Mayor’s Affordable Housing and Viability SPG.
I In order to promote inclusive and mixed 
communities all new affordable housing provision 
should be delivered on-site. Off-site provision 
for major development proposals will only be 
considered in exceptional circumstances, where 
it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the 
Council that:
a. It is not practical or feasible to provide 
affordable housing on-site due to site 
development constraints;
b. A higher level of affordable housing can be 
secured through provision on an alternative 
site;
c. Off-site provision is necessary to better meet 
priority housing need, such as for affordable 
family housing; and
52 This approach is line with the Government’s National 
Planning Practice Guidance and the London Mayor’s 
Affordable Housing and Viability SPG.
170Table 7.2: Small sites affordable housing requirements53
Table 7.3: Small sites affordable housing payments

d. The provision will better support inclusive and 
mixed communities.
Small sites (minor developments)
J Development proposals for new housing 
delivering between 2 and 9 dwelling units must 
make provision for affordable housing., They 
should seek to deliver affordable housing on-site 
wherever feasible Where it can be demonstrated 
to the satisfaction of the Council that off-site 
contributions are acceptable these will be secured 
through planning obligations, with payments 
in lieu calculated using Table 7.2  (Small sites 
affordable housing requirements) and the formula 
set out in Table 7.3  (Small sites affordable 
housing payments in lieu). Further details will be 
set out in the Planning Obligations SPD.
Inclusive and mixed neighbourhoods and 
communities
K In order to secure inclusive and mixed 
neighbourhoods and communities the Council 
may seek to alter the tenure and/or mix of 
affordable housing provision on a case-by-case 
basis. In establishing the most appropriate 
level of provision for a site, development 
proposals will be considered having regard to 
the existing levels of housing tenure and mix 
in the area (including extant permissions), 
53   The equivalent number of on-site affordable units is based 
on the 35 per cent affordable housing requirement of the Fast 
Track Route of the threshold approach set out in London Plan 
policy H5 (Threshold approach to applications), i.e. where 1 
dwelling unit is equivalent to 0.35 affordable units.54 Developer profit is typically applied at between 17-
20% of GDV on private housing and 6% on the affordable 
housing, so the increased profit arising from converting a 
unit from private to affordable housing would be 11% to 
14% (i.e. 17% or 20% less 6%).  54
171
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
7 HOUSINGL All new affordable housing developments 
must be of a high quality design having regard 
to other Local Plan policies.  They must be 
designed to be ‘tenure neutral’ in accordance 
with the National Design Guide, so that 
affordable units are indistinguishable from 
market units in terms of quality of design 
and materials, space standards, access and 
amenity. Where mixed tenure schemes are 
proposed these must ensure all residents of 
the development have access to amenities and 
communal spaces including play spaces, with 
reference to Policy QD2 (Inclusive and safe 
design).
Vacant Building Credit
M The application of the Vacant Building Credit 
(VBC) is not appropriate in Lewisham. The 
use of VBC will only be considered in limited 
circumstances, where applicants suitably 
demonstrate there are exceptional reasons why 
it is appropriate and the following criteria are 
met:
a. The building is not in use at the time the 
application is submitted;
b. The building is not covered by an extant or 
recently expired permission; 
c. The site is not protected for an alternative 
land use; and
d. The building has not been made vacant 
for the sole purpose of redevelopment, as 
demonstrated by evidence showing that the 
building has been vacant for a minimum 
continuous period of five years and has 
been actively marketed for at least two 
years therein, at realistic local area prices. 
172Explanation
The need for genuinely affordable housing 
7.23 Although there is a strong record of housing 
delivery in Lewisham not everyone is able to access 
housing that is affordable within their means. 
The Lewisham SHMA (2022) indicates that whilst 
median house prices in Lewisham are lower than 
those for London on whole they have increased 
by more than 330 per cent over the past twenty 
years. This is marked by an accelerated rate of 
increase from 2013 to 2020, with median house 
prices rising from £259,800 to £430,000 in this 
short period. The rate of increase is significantly 
higher than that experienced across London and 
in many neighbouring boroughs. Home ownership 
is now out of reach for many Lewisham residents, 
particularly first time buyers, with median house 
prices more than 10 times the average household 
income. The cost of private rented sector housing 
has also increased pointedly over recent years. 
Over the 10-year period 2010 to 2020 private 
median rents rose by more than 45 per cent, 
significantly higher than the rate for London 
and England, at 17 and 28 per cent respectively, 
making this housing option unaffordable to 
many. The above situation has contributed to 
acute issues of overcrowding and homelessness 
in the Borough, which is reflected by the 
extensive number of households on the Council’s 
Housing Register. As of May 2019 there were 
approximately 10,000 households on the housing 
waiting list, which represents approximately 
7.6% of households in the Borough55.  In short, 
the gap between incomes and housing costs is 
rapidly widening, and as a consequence there is a 
significant local need for affordable housing.7.24 In light of the above, the Local Plan sets a 
strategic target for 50 per cent of all new 
homes delivered in the Borough to be genuinely 
affordable. The strategic target is considered to be 
in line with the London Plan. However, recognising 
the distinctive characteristics of the local housing 
market and the relative affordability of different 
types of provision to the resident population, a 
local definition of ‘genuinely affordable housing’ 
is necessary. In Lewisham, this means housing at 
social rent levels or GLA’s London Affordable Rent 
level56and below, aiming for target rents. All other 
housing products below market levels, whether for 
sale or rent, are defined as intermediate housing 
and should not be conflated with genuinely 
affordable housing. Furthermore, genuinely 
affordable housing and intermediate housing 
should provide for secure tenancies. For affordable 
homes, we will seek that residents are provided 
with lifetime tenancies, ideally in perpetuity. 
7.25 Our expectation is that the maximum amount of 
genuinely affordable housing will be delivered 
on all new residential development sites, having 
regard to viability. Habitable rooms will be used 
as the basis for calculating affordable housing 
provision against the Borough’s strategic target, 
as advocated by the London Plan. This measure 
provides flexibility to deliver affordable housing 
that is best tailored to meeting the range of local 
needs, and in particular to enable additional 
provision of affordable family sized units to come 
forward.
55 Lewisham Housing Department statistics, May 2019.56 GLA London Affordable Rent is defined locally as 
London Affordable Rent, minus the 1% above Consumer 
Price Index uplift.

1747.26 Affordable housing will be required from all 
large sites with capacity to accommodate 10 or 
more residential units, and this applies where 
development is proposed incrementally. This 
includes variations to a planning consent resulting 
in additional units on the site. This policy seeks 
to guard against actions to circumvent the 
affordable housing requirements, such as through 
the artificial sub-division or phased development 
of sites. In considering whether the affordable 
housing requirement should apply in these 
circumstances, we will have regard to: extent of 
single ownership of land and sites; occupied status 
of land/sites at the grant of permission and at 
commencement of development; and the amount 
of time elapsed between permissions, completions 
and any new proposals. 
7.27 Contributions towards affordable housing will also 
be required on small sites for new developments 
delivering between 2 and 9 dwelling units. 
The Local Plan Viability Assessment (2022) 
demonstrates that this requirement will not 
adversely impact on the development viability 
of small sites across the Borough. Development 
proposals should seek to deliver affordable 
housing on-site wherever feasible. Off-site 
provision will be secured through planning 
obligations with any payments in lieu calculated 
using Table 7.2  and Table 7.3 . 
7.28 In line with the London Plan, a threshold approach 
to viability will be applied in Lewisham. This 
means that schemes meeting or exceeding the 
London Plan policy H5 (Threshold approach 
to applications) without public subsidy can be 
‘fast-tracked’ and are not required to submit 
detailed viability information. However, to ensure an applicant fully intends to build out the 
planning consent an early stage viability review 
will be triggered if an agreed level of progress on 
implementation of the development is not made 
within a specified time period. Thresholds are 
expected to be regularly reviewed by the London 
Plan, and may therefore change over the course of 
the plan period.
7.29 All development proposals will be expected 
to demonstrate that they have maximised the 
amount of genuinely affordable housing on-site 
in contributing to the delivery of the Borough’s 
affordable housing target. Applicants are 
encouraged to investigate realistic options to 
provide a further uplift of genuinely affordable 
housing (i.e. beyond that which can be viability 
delivered through development value alone) 
including through the use of public subsidy. 
This will require engagement with industry 
stakeholders, including Registered Providers, 
early in the development process to identify 
and capitalise on opportunities available. Where 
subsidy is secured, applications will be expected 
to clearly state the level of affordable housing 
that is to be provided using this subsidy. This 
clarification is required in order to assess schemes 
against the policy requirements, and for effective 
and transparent implementation of the threshold 
approach.
7.30 Development proposals that do not provide the 
minimum required amount of genuinely affordable 
housing will be strongly resisted. Where applicants 
consider there are exceptional circumstances 
affecting the viability of a scheme and delivery of 
policy objectives, this must be justified through 
the submission of a detailed Viability Assessment. 
175
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
7 HOUSINGThis must be undertaken by a suitably qualified 
professional (such as one accredited by the 
Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors) and will 
be made publicly available upon validation of 
the planning application. All such assessments 
will be considered having regard to higher level 
policies and associated guidance. This includes the 
NPPF and companion National Planning Practice 
Guidance on ‘Viability and decision taking’, the 
London Plan and Mayor’s Affordable Housing 
and Viability SPG (2017), or future equivalent.  
A lower level of affordable housing will only 
be permissible where there are clear barriers to 
delivery and development is fully justified through 
detailed viability information. We may require 
that an independent appraisal of the Viability 
Assessment is undertaken, which will need to be 
paid for by the applicant.
7.31 Consistent with national planning policy, our 
expectation is that affordable housing will be 
delivered on-site. This is in order to promote 
inclusive and mixed communities, as well as to 
help ensure that there is no undue delay to the 
delivery of affordable housing when it is included 
with proposals for market housing. However, there 
may be exceptional circumstances where it is 
appropriate to deliver affordable housing off-site 
including through payment in lieu. Applications 
will be required to provide robust justification 
for any off-site provision. Viability alone will not 
be considered sufficient justification for off-site 
provision.7.32 When off-site provision is acceptable in principle, 
we will expect all subject sites to be considered 
together for the purpose of calculating the level of 
affordable housing provision required. All off-site 
affordable housing must be provided within the 
Borough and be appropriately located, having 
regard to other policies that seek to provide 
residents with high quality living environments. 
Payment in lieu contributions may be acceptable 
on small-sites and on major developments where 
there are demonstrable benefits to delivering 
affordable housing provision along with inclusive 
and mixed neighbourhoods. Payments will be 
ring-fenced and where appropriate pooled to 
help maximise affordable housing delivery locally. 
Applicants should refer the Mayor’s Affordable 
Housing and Viability SPG (2017), or future 
equivalent, along with the Council’s Planning 
Obligations SPD for further guidance.
7.33 Viability ‘review mechanisms’ are reappraisal 
tools that can be used to ensure maximum public 
benefit is secured from development, including 
benefits associated with affordable housing 
delivery. Review mechanisms can be particularly 
important on phased schemes or schemes with 
longer build out periods, and are a useful way to 
respond to economic uncertainties that may arise 
over the lifetime of a development proposal. We 
will seek to apply viability review mechanisms as a 
standard practice, and implement them in line with 
the London Plan and its associated guidance. This 
will help to ensure that if there is an improvement 
in viability over lifetime of the development 
proposal, this contributes to the maximum amount 
of affordable housing provided. Further details on 
the implementation of this approach are set out in 
the Mayor’s Affordable Housing and Viability SPG 
(2017).
1767.34 The most pressing need in Lewisham is for new 
social homes with social rents. However there 
is also a need for affordable housing which is 
available to people who are unable to access social 
housing due to the rigorous eligibility criteria, 
but are also unable to afford private market 
housing. Therefore, where affordable housing 
is required on new development this should be 
provided on a tenure split basis of 70 per cent 
social rent or London Affordable Rent and 30 per 
cent London Living Rent or shared ownership. 
We support the use of London Living Rent, as by 
its nature, it is affordable to households earning 
the Lewisham median household income. Shared 
ownership products may also be an acceptable 
form of tenure, where the total monthly costs are 
demonstrably affordable.
7.35  In preparing the Local Plan the Council has given 
consideration to First Homes as a component of 
the affordable housing tenure mix. Provisions on 
First Homes were introduced through a Written 
Ministerial Statement on 24 May 2021 and 
incorporated into the NPPG57.  First Homes are a 
specific type of discounted market housing which 
should meet the definition of affordable housing.
7.36 The Lewisham SHMAA (2022) raises issues around 
the affordability of First Homes in the context 
of local median household incomes.  It also sets 
out how the introduction of First Homes would 
adversely impact on the delivery of genuinely 
affordable housing, for which the identified need 
in Lewisham is greatest. The Lewisham Local Plan Viability Assessment (2022) has also tested 
the introduction of First Homes as a component 
of the affordable housing tenure mix, using the 
benchmark 25 per cent proportion recommended 
by the NPPG. It concludes that First Homes are 
unlikely to be accessible to those on lower incomes 
and would result in a significant reduction in 
availability of affordable housing for purchase. In 
light of the above, the Local Plan does not make 
specific provision for First Homes. This position is 
supported by the Mayor of London who has also 
raised concerns about deliverability of First Homes 
in London, particularly around criteria concerning 
price caps on properties and income caps on 
applicants58.  
7.37 In line with other Local Plan policies, all new 
affordable housing development must be of a high 
quality design and incorporate durable materials, 
adhering to the same space and amenity standards 
as market housing. To promote inclusive and mixed 
neighbourhoods and communities it is imperative 
that affordable housing is designed to be ‘tenure 
blind’ and ‘tenure neutral, in accordance with the 
Government’s National Design Guide, so that it 
is indistinguishable from other types of housing. 
Affordable housing must also be sensitively 
integrated into the site and its surroundings to 
ensure that all local residents, irrespective of 
tenure type, are provided with high quality living 
environments and are able to benefit from shared 
access to all on-site amenities.

7 HOUSINGVacant Building Credit
7.38 Vacant Building Credit (VBC) was introduced 
by the Government, in 2014, as a way to 
incentivise development on brownfield sites. It 
is a material consideration in planning decisions. 
VBC applies to sites where a vacant building is 
brought back into lawful use, or is demolished 
to be replaced by a new building. Notably, VBC 
reduces the requirement for affordable housing 
contributions, taking into account the amount of 
vacant floorspace being brought back into use or 
redeveloped. This can have significant implications 
in the Borough where there is a demonstrated 
strategic need for affordable housing.
7.39 Application of the VBC is not considered 
appropriate in Lewisham. Monitoring indicates a 
strong rate of housing delivery locally, with the 
Borough exceeding its cumulative London Plan 
housing target since the adoption of the Core 
Strategy in 2011. Further, there is a pipeline of 
committed sites (with planning consent) and 
allocated future development sites, all of which are 
on brownfield land. Accordingly, brownfield sites 
are coming forward irrespective of the VBC and 
we do not consider that this additional incentive 
is necessary, particularly in an inner-London 
context where the relatively high land values help 
to support the viability of residential led schemes. 
Where proposals involve the use of VBC, evidence 
must be provided to demonstrate that there are 
exceptional circumstances in which to justify 
its application, having regard to the tests and 
requirements set out in this policy.7.40 It should be noted that if an applicant is claiming 
that a scheme qualifies for VBC, it cannot also 
claim Community Infrastructure Levy relief 
through the vacancy test.

A The maintenance, renewal and regeneration 
of Lewisham’s housing estates will play an 
important role in helping to ensure that 
neighbourhoods and communities benefit 
from high quality living environments, housing 
is maintained at a decent standard and new 
genuinely affordable housing is delivered 
locally.
B Development proposals involving housing 
estate renewal and regeneration must be 
carried out in consultation with existing 
residents and the local community, in line with 
the London Mayor’s Good Practice Guide to 
Estate Regeneration, in order to ensure:
a. There is no net loss of affordable housing, 
and an uplift in genuinely affordable 
housing is delivered wherever possible;
b. A range of high quality, genuinely 
affordable housing options are made 
available in the Borough;
c. Existing and new residential units achieve 
the Decent Homes standard; 
d. The development is of a high quality  design 
and provides for demonstrable physical 
improvements to the housing estate and 
local area environment, consistent with 
other Local Plan policies; and
e. Strong and inclusive communities can be 
better fostered and supported, with spaces 
and facilities that enhance opportunities for 
social interaction and integration.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
7 HOUSINGExplanation
7.41 We are committed to ensuring that all Lewisham 
residents have access to a decent home that 
is secure and affordable. This will require that 
significantly more new genuinely affordable 
housing is made available in the Borough. 
Also, that existing residences are brought up 
to and maintained at an appropriate standard, 
particularly within Lewisham’s housing estates. In 
addition, it is vital for the safety and security of 
residents and the wider community that homes 
are well integrated into their neighbourhoods, 
with plentiful opportunities for social interaction, 
and that high quality living environments benefit 
the health and well-being of local residents.
7.42 The Decent Homes programme provides one 
mechanism for housing improvement and has 
been successfully delivered across the Borough. 
However, funding is limited and this type of 
investment may not always be feasible or viable 
for some houses or estates. For example, the 
existing condition or orientation of buildings 
can act as a practical constraint to refurbishment 
works. Nonetheless the Council has a strong 
record in this regard, and through Lewisham 
Homes, the proportion of residential units 
meeting the Decent Homes standard increased 
from 41 per cent to 94 per cent in the 10-year 
period from 2007. 7.43 Housing estates have been developed in the 
Borough over many decades. Their age and 
condition varies and therefore so too does the 
programme of maintenance required for each. 
Some older estates constrain opportunities for 
site or area wide improvements. For instance, 
their layout or design makes it difficult to 
introduce safer access points and through routes, 
more useable amenity space or public realm 
enhancements. In other circumstances, there may 
be options to deliver more affordable housing 
units on estates, either through incremental infill 
or comprehensive redevelopment. Accordingly, 
strategic approaches to estate renewal and 
regeneration may be necessary in certain 
circumstances.
7.44 The nature of the programme for housing estate 
maintenance, renewal and regeneration will 
vary on a case-by-case basis. This policy will 
help to ensure that that all such investment 
is appropriately managed, irrespective of the 
level of works involved, and that local residents 
ultimately benefit from improved access to 
high quality, inclusive and genuinely affordable 
housing and living environments. 
1827.45 All estate renewal and regeneration schemes 
must be carried out in consultation with 
existing residents and the local community. The 
process will be in line with the London Mayor’s 
Good Practice Guide to Estate Regeneration 
(2016), or future equivalent, and the Council’s 
Statement of Community Involvement. All 
development proposals for estate renewal 
and regeneration must ensure that there is 
no net loss of affordable housing, in line with 
other Local Plan policies. Loss of existing 
affordable housing will only be permitted where 
it is replaced by equivalent or better quality 
accommodation, providing at least an equivalent 
level of affordable housing floorspace, on an 
identical or equivalent basis59. Floorspace is 
used as the measure for replacement provision 
as this provides flexibility for the Council and its 
partners to better address acute housing needs, 
such as for more family sized social housing, 
where redevelopment is undertaken. This 
approach is consistent with the London Plan.
59 Affordable housing floorspace must be replaced on an 
identical basis where a tenant has a right to return. Where 
there is no right of return affordable housing must be 
replaced on an identical or equivalent basis, i.e. social rented 
floorspace may be replaced with social rented floorspace or 
by general needs rented accommodation with rents at levels 
based on that which has been lost.

7 HOUSING184Opposite: Hazelhurst Court (Levitt Bernstein)HO5 Accommodation for older people
A The housing needs of older people will be 
met mainly through conventional residential 
accommodation in the C3 Use Class that 
is designed in a way that allows for easy 
adaptation to the different needs of users 
over their lifetime. This includes new build 
development and the appropriate retrofitting 
of housing units. Specialist older person’s 
accommodation and care home accommodation 
should supplement conventional housing to 
meet the needs of Lewisham’s older resident 
population.
Specialist older persons accommodation
B Development proposals for specialist older 
persons accommodation will only be supported 
where they:
a. Respond positively to the objectives in 
Lewisham’s Housing Strategy;
b. Make provision for a mix of tenure types 
including affordable housing with reference to 
Policy HO3 (Genuinely affordable housing);
c. Make provision of accessible housing, in line 
with Policy QD2 (Inclusive and safe design);
d. Are sited at well-connected locations that are 
well-served by public transport and provide 
for good access to community facilities and 
services (including health and social care) 
appropriate to the intended occupiers;
e. Are of a high quality design with fit for 
purpose accommodation and facilities 
suited to occupiers, staff and visitors, giving 
consideration to:
i. The level of independence of occupiers 
and corresponding level of managed care 
provision or support;
ii. Private, communal and public amenity 
space; andiii. Access, parking and servicing arrangements, 
including for all types of vehicles expected 
to access the development.
Care home accommodation
C Development proposals for care home 
accommodation in the C2 Use Class will only be 
supported where they are appropriately located 
and of a high quality design, having regard to 
Policy HO6.B.d-e. In addition, development 
proposals must ensure that 100 per cent of 
habitable rooms are wheelchair accessible.
Loss of specialist older persons and care home 
accommodation
D Development proposals that will result in the net 
loss of floorspace for specialist older persons or 
care home accommodation will be refused unless 
it can be demonstrated that:
a. There is a long-term surplus of this type of 
accommodation in Lewisham (i.e. there is no 
unmet local need); or
b. Adequate replacement provision will be 
provided on-site or elsewhere within the 
Borough; or
c. The existing accommodation is not suitable 
to support the intended occupants in its 
current condition and/or is incapable of being 
maintained at an acceptable modern standard.
E Where the loss of specialist older persons or 
care home accommodation is acceptable in line 
with (D) above, development proposals must 
secure the re-provision of an equivalent amount 
of floorspace for residential use, ensuring no 
net loss of affordable housing, and provide new 
affordable housing, where appropriate.

7 HOUSINGExplanation
7.46 The number of people in the Borough aged 
65 and over is forecast to rise by 71.5 per cent 
over the plan period, and by 2040 there will 
be an additional 21,074 residents in this age 
category60.  We are committed to ensuring that 
a wide range of high quality and affordable 
housing options are available to older people. 
This includes accommodation for those seeking 
to remain in their homes61, downsize from larger 
homes whilst remaining in the area, or people 
requiring more tailored, specialist accommodation 
with elements of support or care.
7.47 Local needs for older persons accommodation 
should be met principally through conventional 
housing. Where this is a good level of this 
type of provision available in the Borough 
there will be less reliance on specialist forms of 
accommodation. All new residential development 
in the C3 Use Class must therefore be designed 
to be adaptable to the varying needs of users 
at all stages of life, in line with Policy QD 
2 (Inclusive and safe design). We will also 
encourage the retrofitting of existing residential 
buildings and units to better suit the day-to-
day needs of older people, including by making 
them wheelchair adaptable or accessible. All 
proposals for retrofitting must ensure compliance 
with other Local Plan policies, particularly 
those on the historic environment. Internal or 
external alterations have the potential to harm 
the significance of heritage assets or otherwise 
impact on local character. 7.48 The Lewisham SHMA (2022) indicates that there 
are a number of housing options available for 
older people in the Borough, including some 
3,200 units of specialist accommodation with 
integrated elements of support or care. This 
provision is helping to meet the varying types of 
need, but it is recognised additional capacity is 
required. The total additional need for specialist 
older person dwellings across Lewisham is 
projected to be 2,422 by 2040. This is broken 
down to 1,969 units of Class C3 units (such as 
sheltered or extra care housing) and 453 units 
of Class C2 units (such as residential care). This 
translates to an annual need for 98 C3 dwellings 
plus 23 units of C2 dwellings each year, which 
is comparable to the London Plan benchmark 
for Lewisham of 100 specialist older person 
dwellings 2017 to 2029.
7.49 The London Plan discusses the range of 
accommodation options that are available to 
older people. It clearly distinguishes between 
specialist older persons accommodation and 
care home accommodation. Applications must 
state the use for which planning permission is 
sought. The nature of development proposals 
will be established based on the definitions 
and attributes of specialist and care home 
accommodation set out in the London Plan. 
60 Lewisham SHMA (2022).
61 The Lewisham SHMA cites a national database which 
suggests that more than three-quarters of older people 
want to remain in their current home with help and support 
when needed.
1867.50 Where a development proposal does not 
meet the attributes of specialist older persons 
accommodation or care home accommodation set 
out in the London Plan, then the general housing 
policies in the London Plan and Local Plan will 
apply.
7.51 Specialist older persons and care home 
accommodation must be sensitively integrated 
into neighbourhoods at locations that are 
well-connected by public transport, and within 
easy reach of community facilities and services. 
Residents, carers and visitors should benefit from 
safe and convenient access to and from the site 
as well as the surrounding area. Developments 
should include accessible pathways and gradients 
to enable residents to move with relative ease 
whether by walking or with the use of aids, such 
as wheelchairs or mobility scooters. Accessibility 
is vital to ensuring the development adequately 
responds to the mobility needs of occupiers. It 
is also important to promote independence and 
facilitate social interaction, which in turn can help 
to address isolation and loneliness, which is a key 
public health issue.7.52 Development proposals should be designed with 
reference to inclusive and safe design principles, 
taking into account the latest industry good 
practice guidance. They should promote and 
adequately respond to the sharing or joint use 
of facilities, particularly to encourage a sense of 
community belonging. Development should also 
be designed to ensure a good fit between the 
facilities supplied and the specialist needs of the 
intended occupants.  This includes consideration 
for the level of managed care provision and 
support required by occupants, along with 
the need for high quality facilities such as 
amenity space storage, and space for charging 
of mobility scooters. Developments must also 
make adequate provision for access, parking and 
servicing for vehicles, with drop-off points for 
taxis, mini-buses and ambulances located near 
the building’s principal entrance.

7 HOUSINGHO6 Supported and specialised accommodation
A Development proposals for supported and 
specialised accommodation will only be 
supported where they:
a. Meet an identified need for the type of 
accommodation proposed;
b. Make provision for a mix of tenure types 
including affordable housing, where 
appropriate, with reference to Policy HO3 
(Genuinely affordable housing);
c. Support mixed and inclusive 
neighbourhoods and communities without 
leading to a harmful overconcentration of 
supported or specialised accommodation. 
This will be assessed where the character of 
the area has changed or local amenity has 
been adversely impacted as a result of:
i. Visual amenity;
ii. Increased noise;
iii. Vehicular traffic generation, along with 
car and cycle parking pressure;
iv. Inadequate provision of waste 
management and recycling facilities;
v. Additional pressure on community 
facilities; and
vi. Anti-social behaviour and public safety.
d. Are appropriately located in areas that are 
well-connected to services and facilities that 
are likely to be required by the occupiers; 
e. Are of a high quality design, giving 
consideration to the:
i. Intensity of use that is appropriate to the 
size of the development;ii. Integration of accommodation and 
facilities for the specific use or group it is 
intended for;
iii. Suitable arrangements for managed care 
or supervision, security and community 
safety; and
iv. Protection of the amenity of adjoining 
and neighbouring uses.
B Development proposals that will result in 
the net loss of floorspace for supported or 
specialised accommodation will be refused 
unless it can be suitably demonstrated that:
a. The specific type of accommodation is no 
longer required for the particular use and/
or group, or other relevant groups in need 
of supported housing; or
b. Adequate replacement provision will be 
provided; or
c. The existing accommodation is not suitable 
for the support or care of the intended 
occupants in its current condition and 
format and/or is incapable of being 
maintained at an acceptable standard.
C Where the loss of accommodation is 
acceptable in line with (B) above, development 
proposals must secure the re-provision of an 
equivalent amount of floorspace for residential 
use, including an element of affordable 
housing, where appropriate.
188Explanation
7.53 It is important that everyone has access to a 
decent and secure home. Supported and other 
forms of specialised accommodation offer respite 
and provision of care or support for individuals 
with distinct needs, particularly those from more 
vulnerable groups, whether for temporary stays 
or longer-term periods. The London Plan includes 
a detailed list of groups for whom supported and 
specialised accommodation is suited62. Supported 
accommodation can take a variety of forms and 
fall into different Use Classes, depending on the 
nature of use and type of care or supervision 
required.
7.54 In line with the Corporate Strategy, which aims 
for the Borough to be a welcoming place of 
safety for all, and also building on Lewisham’s 
role as a ‘Borough of Sanctuary’63, the Local 
Plan broadly supports development proposals 
involving the retention, refurbishment 
and delivery of supported and specialised 
accommodation. Applications should clearly set 
out how the development will assist in meeting 
an identified need for the use proposed. It is vital 
that the accommodation is appropriate for the 
use and group(s) for which it is intended, so that 
the specific type of managed care or supervision 
required can be delivered effectively. Applicants 
are encouraged engage with relevant health and 
social care providers or stakeholders through the 
design-led approach. In order to secure mixed 
and inclusive neighbourhoods and communities, development proposals should not result in a 
harmful overconcentration of similar uses within 
an area.  
7.55 Existing supported housing should be 
retained and maintained to a decent standard. 
Development proposals involving the change of 
use or loss of accommodation on the basis of 
HO6.B.a above must consider need at both the 
local and sub-regional level, recognising that 
delivery of provision for certain types of uses or 
groups may involve stakeholders across Lewisham 
and its neighbouring authorities.

this type of housing (giving priority to 
the local student population), will not 
compromise delivery against the Borough’s 
strategic housing target and principal need

where appropriate.
192Explanation
7.56 Lewisham is home to a number of further and 
higher education institutions. This includes 
Goldsmiths College at New Cross, Trinity Laban 
Conservatory of Music and Dance at Deptford, 
and Lewisham College at Deptford Bridge and 
Lewisham Way. Greenwich University in the Royal 
Borough of Greenwich is also located nearby. It 
is important that Lewisham’s student population 
is able to access affordable accommodation, 
ideally in proximity to the places where people 
take up studies. PBSA can therefore play a role 
in meeting local housing needs. It also has the 
benefit of relieving pressure on the private 
rented market, enabling opportunities for others 
to access housing that might not otherwise be 
available. The Lewisham SHMA (2022) indicates 
that more than 1,000 dwellings were wholly 
occupied by students in 2021. In addition, 
PBSA can benefit Lewisham’s neighbourhoods 
and communities, for example, by attracting 
a student population that supports the local 
economy, complements the creative and cultural 
industries and stimulates inward investment.
7.57 PBSA is defined as non-conventional housing, 
which for purposes of delivery against the 
Borough’s strategic housing target, is counted on 
a 2.5:1 basis (i.e. two and a half bedrooms/units 
is equivalent to one unit of housing). Compared 
with conventional housing, where units are 
counted on a 1:1 basis, student accommodation 
may not always provide the most optimal use of 
land or contribute to addressing the Borough’s 
most pressing housing needs. The Lewisham 
SHMA points to the significant amount of PBSA 
recently delivered in the Borough including the 
proliferation of off-campus accommodation. Some 1,686 units were delivered and consented 
from 2016 to 2021, or an average of 337 per 
year. Additional student bedspaces have been 
consented since then. The London Plan sets out 
an overall target for London of 3,500 PBSA units 
per annum across all boroughs. In this context, 
Lewisham is making a significant contribution to 
meeting London’s needs for PBSA. A carefully 
managed approach to additional capacity is 
therefore required. Development proposals must 
clearly demonstrate that the provision will not 
lead to a harmful overconcentration of PBSA. 
It is also critical that they do not compromise 
or suppress the delivery of conventional 
housing, for which need in Lewisham is 
greatest. The London Plan makes clear that 
meeting the requirement for PBSA should not 
undermine policy to secure mixed and inclusive 
neighbourhoods64.

7 HOUSING7.58 New PBSA must be developed and secured for 
occupation by students of one or more specific 
higher education institutions. This is to guard 
against speculative development and ensure 
proposals genuinely help to address identified 
need. Applications must provide evidence of an 
end user affiliated with an educational provider. 
They must also demonstrate appropriate 
management arrangements are in place so that 
rooms will be rented solely to students over 
the lifetime of the development, including 
an identified landlord, agent or management 
company. The London Plan makes clear that if 
the accommodation is not secured for use by 
students and for occupation by members of one 
or more specified higher educational institutions, 
development is not considered PBSA and will be 
considered against policies on shared housing 
and communal living.
7.59 The London Plan provides that at least 35% of 
PBSA should be secured as affordable housing. 
This is in order to ensure that students with 
an income equivalent to that provided to full-
time UK students by state funded sources of 
financial support for living costs can afford to 
stay in PBSA. We will apply the definition of 
affordable student accommodation as set in the 
London Plan and its supplementary guidance. 
London Plan policy H15 (Purpose built student 
accommodation) sets out requirements regarding 
the delivery of affordable student units, including 
circumstances in which the Fast-Track Route or 
Viability Tested Route may be taken, and should 
be referred for further information. Affordable 
rent levels may be subject to periodic review over 
the life of the Local Plan, taking into account 
any significant changes that may be made to the 
Government’s student maintenance loan regime.7.60 New PBSA should be directed to well-connected 
and highly accessible locations that benefit 
from good provision of walking routes and  
cycleways, and are within easy reach of services 
and facilities. During the site selection process 
applicants should give priority to locations 
in proximity to the institutions that the 
development will serve. PBSA that is intended to 
meet need arising from outside of the Borough 
should be sufficiently justified in respect of the 
site location.
7.61 New PBSA must be of a high quality design 
and construction, with functional layouts and 
well-integrated living and communal spaces and 
facilities. Developments should make provision 
for communal amenity space taking into account 
the recommended benchmark of 1 square 
metre internal and external communal amenity 
space per student bed. This is particularly 
important in the absence of national or regional 
policy requirements or standards for private 
external amenity space in PBSA. Development 
proposals should use the design-led approach 
to demonstrate that the amount of communal 
amenity space is appropriate to the site. It 
should meet the latest industry standards as 
demonstrated through the use of Accreditation 
Network UK or other similar scheme. Student 
bedrooms/units and layouts should be varied to 
cater to the needs of wheelchair users, mature 
students with families, students who want to 
live alone and for groups of students using 
shared facilities. The specific requirements of 
educational institutions should be considered and 
accounted for wherever possible.
1947.62 Whilst many students require accommodation 
during term time only, some residents may need 
a permanent home throughout their studies and 
development therefore should make provision 
of units for year round occupation. To help 
ensure the viability of PBSA, we will provide 
flexibility to allow for the temporary or ancillary 
use of accommodation during vacation periods 
or term breaks. Proposals will be considered on 
a case-by-case basis. Planning conditions or 
legal agreements will be used to ensure that any 
temporary or ancillary uses do not result in a 
material change of use of the building. 
7.63 Site management and maintenance plans are 
important to delivering successful student housing 
schemes. These plans will be required for all new 
PBSA and will normally be secured as a planning 
condition. Management plans will be expected 
to cover matters such as site management 
and maintenance, on-site wardens, communal 
facilities, safety and security for occupants and 
elimination of potential noise nuisance.
7.64 We will seek to prevent the loss of existing 
student accommodation. This is particularly 
to ensure that such loss does not adversely 
impact on existing capacity or existing residents, 
whose displacement could create additional 
pressure on the conventional housing market. 
However, flexibility will be applied where it can 
be suitably demonstrated that demand for the 
provision in question no longer exists. We will 
encourage the refurbishment of buildings to 
ensure student accommodation is brought up to 
an acceptable modern standard. Proposals will be 
supported where there is adequate re-provision of 
accommodation and other policy requirements are 
satisfied.

196HO8 Housing with shared facilities (Houses in Multiple 
Occupation) 
A Development proposals for housing with shared 
facilities (i.e. Houses in Multiple Occupation) 
(HMOs) in the Sui Generis Use Class will only be 
permitted where they:
a. Do not result in the loss of existing housing 
suitable for family occupation, which 
includes but is not limited to the following 
considerations:
i. Location within a residential street or area;
ii. Size and layout, including number and size 
of individual rooms and bedrooms;
iii. Amenity space, such as access to a private 
garden;
b. Contribute to inclusive and mixed 
neighbourhoods and do not result in a harmful 
overconcentration of HMOs. This will be 
assessed where the character of the area has 
changed or local amenity has been adversely 
impacted as a result of: 
i. Visual amenity, including impacts arising 
from poorly maintained properties;
ii. Increased noise;
iii. Vehicular traffic generation, along with car 
and cycle parking pressure;
iv. Inadequate provision of waste management 
and recycling facilities;
v. Additional pressure on community facilities; 
and
vi. Anti-social behaviour and public safety. 
c. Are appropriately located in areas that are well-
connected to local services by walking, cycling 
and public transport; and
d. Are well-designed and provide high quality 
accommodation that satisfies the relevant 
standards for HMOs, including units that 
provide adequate functional living spaces and 
layouts.B Development proposals for small HMOs in the C4 
Use Class (i.e. 3 to 6 unrelated people) within any 
area covered by an Article 4 Direction will only be 
permitted where:
a. The gross original internal floorspace of the 
original dwelling is 130 square metres or greater; 
and
b. The requirements of (A)(b-d) above are satisfied.
C Development proposals that result in the loss of 
an HMO, or the self-containment of any part of 
an HMO, will be refused unless it can be suitably 
demonstrated that:
a. The existing building does not meet the 
appropriate standards for an HMO and has no 
realistic prospect of meeting the standards; and
b. Adequate replacement provision can be secured 
within the Borough, having regard to the 
requirements of (A) above, with no net loss in 
HMO floorspace; or
c. Any replacement use includes housing provision 
that meets an acute local need, particularly 
genuinely affordable housing, with at least the 
equivalent amount of residential floorspace re-
provided-

7 HOUSINGLarge-scale purpose-built shared living 
accommodation
D Development proposals for large-scale 
purpose-built shared living accommodation 
in the Sui Generis Use Class will only be 
permitted where it is suitably demonstrated 
that:
a. There is an identified local market demand 
for the type of housing proposed and the 
development will not lead to a proliferation 
of this type of development in an area and 
the Borough which will compromise the 
delivery of conventional housing;
b. Private units within the development are 
demonstrably not self-contained homes in 
the C3 Use Class or capable of being used 
as self-contained homes;
c. There is well-integrated provision of 
communal facilities and services sufficient 
to meet the requirements of the intended 
number of occupiers; 
d. The development is appropriately located 
and of a high quality design, having regard 
to the requirements of (A) above; 
e. The development will be under single 
management, suitably managed and 
maintained over its lifetime, as evidenced by 
a management plan; 
f. All units are available to rent, with minimum 
tenancy lengths of no less than 3 months; 
and
g. A cash-in-lieu contribution is made towards 
affordable housing in the C3 Use Class. 
198Explanation
7.65  A house with shared facilities, or House in 
Multiple Occupation (HMO), refers to a shared 
house, flat or other non-self-contained dwelling 
that is the main residence for 3 or more occupiers 
forming 2 or more households. A household is 
generally a family (or people with relationships 
similar to a family), including single persons and 
co-habiting couples. There are two planning Use 
Classes for housing with shared facilities. A Use 
Class C4 HMO is a ‘small’ HMO used by 3 to 6 
unrelated people. A ‘large’ HMO shared by more 
than 6 unrelated people is a Sui Generis use65. 
7.66 It is permitted to change a Use Class C4 HMO 
property to a Use Class C3 dwelling house 
without planning consent, and vice versa. 
Therefore, for planning policy implementation 
we will generally treat small HMOs in the same 
way as self-contained homes, with legislation 
controlling changes of use between these Use 
Classes. Exceptions apply in situations where an 
Article 4 Direction covers a specified area.
7.67 Planning permission is required for the use of 
land and buildings for large HMOs in the Sui 
Generis Use Class. Some forms of housing with 
shared facilities are not considered HMOs in 
planning terms (for example, Purpose Built 
Student Accommodation and supported housing) 
and these are addressed elsewhere in the Local 
Plan.
65 The above provides a summary of HMOs and the full 
legal definitions should be referred as appropriate, as 
set out in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) 
Order 1987 (as amended). There are separate definitions 
in respect of the legal licencing of HMOs as set out in the 
Housing Act 2004 and related secondary legislation.7.68 The London Plan acknowledges the role 
that HMOs play in London as a strategically 
important part of the Capital’s housing supply, 
with provision that helps to meet distinct needs 
and reduces pressure on other elements of the 
housing stock. The Lewisham Strategic Housing 
Market Assessment (2022) indicates that 
HMOs have contributed to making available 
a wider range of housing options and can 
continue to play a role in meeting local housing 
needs.  However this type of provision must 
be carefully managed in order to ensure high 
quality housing that supports mixed and inclusive 
neighbourhoods and communities.
7.69 To ensure that HMOs are built and maintained 
at an acceptable standard the Council operates 
mandatory and additional licencing schemes, in 
accordance with housing legislation. Through 
this regime we have published the Lewisham 
Standards for Licensable HMOs. All development 
proposals for HMOs must ensure these standards, 
or any future equivalent, are met as a minimum, 
irrespective of associated licencing requirements. 
The standards should be considered alongside 
other planning policies to ensure that new 
housing is fit for purpose.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
7 HOUSING7.70 Good quality HMOs make an important 
contribution to local housing provision, 
particularly for vulnerable groups and those on 
lower incomes. For some people the availability 
of bedsits may be the only alternative to 
homelessness. For these reasons the loss of good 
quality shared living accommodation will be 
resisted, including where loss occurs through the 
self-containment of parts or all of buildings. We 
will seek to protect HMOs where there is good 
reason to believe they could be improved to a 
decent standard.
7.71 Consideration will be given to changes of use of 
existing HMOs where it is suitably demonstrated 
that the building does not meet local and other 
relevant standards, as set out in the Housing 
Act 2004 and the Management of HMOs 
(England) (Regulations) 2006), and has no 
realistic prospect of meeting these. The Council’s 
Environmental Health team will be consulted on 
a case-by-case basis to assist in determining the 
condition of the accommodation and whether 
it can be maintained at an acceptable standard. 
Where change of use or re-development is 
acceptable in principle, development proposals 
must make appropriate re-provision of residential 
floorspace giving priority to HMO or other 
accommodation to meet priority needs in the 
Borough, including genuinely affordable housing.
7.72 New HMOs should contribute positively to their 
local area.. and must not result in a harmful 
overconcentration of HMOs. This is to ensure 
an appropriate distribution of different types 
of housing provision across the Borough, along 
with the protection of the character and amenity 
of immediate and neighbouring properties. 
Furthermore, as with other forms of higher density development, housing with shared 
facilities should be sustainably located in well-
connected areas with good access to facilities 
and services.
7.73 The Council has  continued to monitor and 
review of HMO accommodation in Lewisham A 
2018 review identified a substantial clustering 
of HMOs in the south of the Borough66The 
Council subsequently implemented an Article 4 
Direction to remove the Permitted Development 
rights for the conversion of single dwellings 
into small HMOs (3-6 bedrooms) within parts 
of the Borough’s south. The latest 2022 review 
concludes that there has been a significant 
increase in HMOs in Lewisham since 2018, 
with an overconcentration of HMOs evident 
across the Borough in wards with either a low, 
medium or high presence of HMOs traditionally. 
Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest 
this has resulted in adverse impacts on local 
amenity67. The Council is therefore considering 
extending the Article 4 Direction area. 
Development proposals for new small HMOs in 
areas covered by an Article 4 Direction will be 
considered against Part (B) of the policy. 
Large-scale purpose built shared living 
accommodation
7.74 Large-scale purpose-built shared living 
accommodation, including co-living schemes, 
are similar in built form and layout to student 
housing but tend to include facilities, services 
and communal spaces tailored to a wider range 
of occupants, such as young professionals. 
66 Lewisham HMO Review and Evidence Paper Update (2018)
67  Lewisham HMO Review and Evidence Base Paper (May 
2022).
200The London Plan defines this type of provision 
as a shared living accommodation generally 
comprising of 50 units or more. In Lewisham this 
threshold will be established on a case-by-case 
basis, with the London Plan and relevant Local 
Plan policies applying on developments of 20 
or more units as a guideline. This is owing to 
the significant variances in the character, urban 
structure and mix of uses across the Borough, 
and the need to ensure development of this 
nature and scale is appropriate to its location.
7.75 Whilst recognising that housing with shared 
facilities contributes to meeting housing need in 
London, the Lewisham SHMA (2022) indicates 
that there is an acute need in the Borough for 
conventional housing, especially genuinely 
affordable self-contained housing, including for 
families. Development proposals for large-scale 
purpose-built shared living will therefore only 
be supported where there is an identified local 
market demand for such provision, and they will 
not lead to a proliferation of this type of housing 
locally. This is to ensure that development 
does not compromise opportunities to deliver 
conventional self-contained, family housing 
and affordable housing units, and to prevent 
against speculative development which does not 
adequately respond to local need. Applicants 
will be required to submit robust evidence of 
market demand in the Borough for the type 
of provision proposed, along with evidence to 
demonstrate that the development will not result 
in a proliferation of purpose-built shared living in 
the Borough.
7.76 It is imperative that large-scale shared 
accommodation is of a high quality design 
and  well-managed  in order to address the requirements and number of residents it is 
intended for. This includes provision of high 
quality, adequately sized and functional living 
spaces, communal indoor and outdoor amenity 
areas, and shared facilities. Development 
proposals must be accompanied by a management 
plan covering matters such as site management 
and maintenance, communal facilities, safety and 
security for occupants, and mitigation of potential 
noise or other nuisance.
7.77 All large-scale shared living units must be 
available for rent with minimum tenancy lengths  
of at least 3 months, in line with the London Plan. 
This is necessary to ensure that the development 
is retained as shared accommodation over its 
lifetime. We will seek to ensure that development 
is appropriately designed and managed in order 
to prevent against future material changes of use, 
where development effectively reverts to another 
form of specialist accommodation, such as a large 
scale hostel, which is not considered appropriate 
in the Borough, or conventional housing for 
which the building is not originally designed and 
intended for.
7.78 Development proposals for large-scale purpose-
built living accommodation must make a cash-
in-lieu contribution towards affordable housing 
in the C3 Use Class. In line with the London 
Plan, the contribution is to be equivalent to 35 
per cent of the units, or 50 per cent where the 
development is on public sector land or industrial 
land appropriate for residential uses, in accordance 
with Policy E7, to be provided at 50 per cent 
of the market rent. The nature of the payment, 
whether up-front cash-in-lieu or annual payments 
in perpetuity to the Council, will be established on 
a case-by-case basis.

7 HOUSINGHO9 Self-build and custom-build housing
A The Council will keep a register of those seeking 
to acquire serviced plots in the Borough for 
their own self-build and custom-build house 
building. It will also seek to identify plots to 
help meet identified need for self-build and 
custom-build housing particularly where this will 
improve access to affordable housing.
B Development proposals for self-build or 
custom-build housing will only be supported 
where they:
a. Make the optimal use of land and support 
the delivery of the spatial strategy,; 
b. Make provision for affordable housing in 
line with Policy HO3 (Genuinely affordable 
housing); and
c. Are appropriately located and of a high 
quality design, with reference to other Local 
Plan policies.
C Development proposals for self-build and 
custom-build housing must demonstrate 
how the design-led approach has been used. 
They should clearly identify whether there are 
any elements of the design that may require 
adaptation to secure the delivery of new 
housing.
202Explanation
7.79 Self-build and custom-build housing is housing 
that is built or commissioned by individuals, 
or associations of individuals, for their own 
occupation. This type of development can 
provide a more affordable route to home 
ownership than other options available, such 
as ‘built for sale’ market housing. Self-build 
generally refers to people who apply their own 
skills in the design and construction process, 
whereas custom-build involves the outsourcing 
of industry professionals, often for bespoke or 
innovate schemes. Self-build and custom-build 
housing units provide an additional source of 
supply of conventional housing and a further 
housing choice, and will therefore be considered 
as housing in the C3 Use Class for policy 
implementation.
7.80 The Council has a duty under the Self Build and 
Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 and Custom 
Housebuilding (Register) Regulations 2016 to 
keep a register of those seeking to acquire plots 
for self-build and custom-build housing in the 
Borough and to have regard to this register in 
its planning and housing functions. The register 
forms part of the Local Plan evidence base. It 
provides an indication of the demand for serviced 
plots from individuals or groups who meet 
specific eligibility criteria. The Lewisham SHMA 
(2022) has also considered demand for this type 
of provision. This research indicates that whilst 
there is some interest locally it comprises a small 
proportion of Lewisham’s overall housing need. 
In addition, more than one-third of applicants on 
the local register have also expressed an interest 
in the Greater London Authority register, and it is 
therefore not clear whether demand is exclusively 
for Lewisham or elsewhere. 7.81 Identifying suitable sites for self-build and 
custom-build housing in Lewisham will remain 
a challenge with the limited (and often 
constrained) supply of land to meet the needs of 
a growing population. This is particularly given 
that all applicants on the Council’s local register 
have expressed a preference for plots located 
in ‘town centres’. These are locations where 
the capacity of sites will need to be optimised 
through higher-density development, in line with 
the spatial strategy for the Borough, and may not 
be best suited for more moderately scaled self-
build or custom-build projects. Local land values 
may also present viability issues for those seeking 
to acquire plots.
7.82 Development proposals for self-build and 
custom-build housing must use the design-led 
approach to ensure high quality development 
that responds positively to the locality, optimises 
the capacity of sites and supports the delivery of 
the spatial strategy for the Borough. Applicants 
should clearly identify whether any elements of 
the design may require adaptation or alterations. 
This will help the Council to work with applicants 
to respond to the unique challenges facing 
self-builders and to ensure schemes are policy 
compliant. Provision for affordable housing will 
be required in line with other Local Plan policies.

7 HOUSINGHO10 Gypsy and traveller accommodation
A There is an identified need in Lewisham up to 
2031 for 6 additional permanent gypsy and 
traveller pitches. To meet this need in full a 
site allocation policy is included in this Local 
Plan. 
B Development proposals for gypsy and traveller 
accommodation, including sites and pitches, 
must be of a high quality layout and design 
and make adequate provision for:
a. Basic amenities including running water, 
sewerage/drainage, energy and waste 
management;
b. Safe and reasonably convenient access to 
and from the site;
c. Access, parking and servicing arrangements 
for all vehicles likely to use the site, 
including emergency services;
d. A site location that is well-integrated into 
the locality with reasonable access to local 
shops, services and community facilities 
including education, health and social care; 
and
e. Facilities to serve occupiers of the 
development, including where appropriate 
pitches, hardstanding, amenity blocks, and 
amenity space and play areas.
C Development proposals for gypsy and traveller 
accommodation must not pose a risk to 
public health and safety, and not adversely 
impact on the amenity of site occupants and 
neighbouring properties.
204Explanation
7.83 The National Planning Policy for Traveller Sites 
(2015), which sits alongside the NPPF, sets 
out the Government’s aim to ensure fair and 
equal treatment for travellers, in a way that 
facilitates their traditional and nomadic way 
of life of while respecting the interests of the 
settled community. The London Plan requires the 
Local Plan to include a 10-year pitch target for 
permanent gypsy and traveller pitches, based on 
a needs assessment68.  
7.84 Travellers are part of the diverse community 
in Lewisham. The Council has undertaken an 
assessment to understand the housing needs of 
Lewisham’s gypsy and traveller population. The 
Lewisham Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation 
Assessment (2015 and amended 2016) identifies 
a need for 6 pitches up to 2031. This need 
arises from people currently living in bricks and 
mortar homes, teenage children and household 
formation. To meet this need a site allocation 
policy is included in Part 3 of the Local Plan 
(Lewisham’s South Area, Land at Pool Court). 
A Masterplan and Capacity Study (2018) 
demonstrates that this type of housing provision 
can feasibly be delivered at the site.
68 London Plan (2021) Policy H14 (Gypsy and traveller 
accommodation) sets out that Boroughs that have not 
undertaken a needs assessment since 2008 should use the 
targets included in Table 4.4 of the London Plan.7.85 The London Plan states that a London-wide 
gypsy and traveller needs assessment will be 
undertaken in the future. The Council will 
monitor any changes to the London Plan to 
inform a future review of the Local Plan. In the 
interim, development proposals for new gypsy 
and traveller sites, pitches and/or plots will be 
assessed against this policy..

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.1 London is a global centre of trade and commerce 
and the engine of the UK economy. Prior to 
Covid-19 London underwent a strong and 
sustained period of economic growth. However 
the same levels of growth were not experienced 
in Lewisham. Whilst the number of new 
businesses being formed in the Borough has 
risen over recent years much of this is due to 
structural changes in the nature of work with 
higher levels of self-employment and contract 
work along with expansion of the gig economy. 
There are just 40 jobs in Lewisham for every 
100 working age residents, the second lowest 
proportion of any London borough. In addition, 
local employment is underrepresented in higher 
skill sectors, such as professional services. Wage 
levels for workers in Lewisham are lower than the 
regional average69.  In short, London generates a 
significant amount of wealth but the benefits of 
its economic success are not evenly or equitably 
shared within it.
8.2 Covid-19 has had a pronounced short-term 
impact on the UK economy. The magnitude 
of the recession caused by the pandemic is 
unprecedented and the 9.8 per cent decline in 
2020 of the country’s Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP), a key measure of economic output, is 
the steepest since records began70. London has 
suffered severely during the pandemic and it 
faces a challenging economic outlook over the 
short-to-medium term71.  Covid-19 has also 
affected the nature of business activity, for example, by accelerating trends in home-working 
and the use of multi-channel or online shopping. 
There remain uncertainties on the long-term 
implications of the pandemic however it is clear 
that targeted measures are needed to support 
Lewisham’s economic recovery.
8.3 Helping to facilitate the creation of a thriving 
local economy that tackles inequalities is one 
of the Local Plan’s key strategic objectives. To 
realise this objective it will be necessary to grow, 
strengthen and diversify the local employment 
base. Lewisham has lost a significant amount of 
its industrial capacity over recent years, and at a 
faster rate than the rest of London, diminishing 
its relatively limited supply of employment land72.  
To meet the Borough’s future needs for business 
activity and jobs it will be necessary to safeguard 
employment land and create new modern 
workspace. By delivering this provision it will be 
easier to attract different types of industries and 
employers to the Borough, whilst also ensuring 
local businesses have space to start-up, grow 
and prosper. This is particularly important for 
sectors where Lewisham can perform a niche 
role. These include the cultural, creative and 
digital industries, for example, whose presence 
in Deptford and New Cross has enabled the area 
to be designated one of London’s first Creative 
Enterprise Zones (CEZ). The green industries also 
present opportunities to respond to the climate 
emergency by supporting London’s transition to 
a low carbon, circular economy.

2108.4 In order to tackle inequalities and the economic 
barriers that affect people’s lives it is imperative 
that everyone has opportunities to access good 
quality jobs along with high quality education, 
skills and training. It is recognised that many 
people take up work or training outside of the 
Borough, taking advantage Lewisham’s good 
transport links to the rest of London and beyond. 
However, securing a wide range of local provision 
is vital to creating a more inclusive economy 
and giving residents greater choice in accessing 
opportunities closer to where they live. This 
policy sets out our overall approach to facilitate 
development and channel investment in a way 
that allows everyone to share in Lewisham’s 
economic prosperity.Deptford Market

Land Hierarchy , is safeguarded for Class E(g) 
office and light industrial, Class B2 industrial, 
Class B8 storage and distribution and related 
Sui Generis uses. Development proposals  
must ensure that land-uses are commensurate 
with the type and function of land within this 
hierarchy.
B There is a forecast need for 21,800 square 
metres of net additional employment floorspace 
in the Borough up to 2038. Development 
proposals must contribute to meeting this need 
by:
a. Within Strategic Industrial Locations (SIL) 
and Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSIS), 
retaining and wherever possible delivering 
net gains in industrial capacity, including by 
intensifying the use of land;
b. Facilitating the delivery of new modern 
workspace through the comprehensive 
regeneration of Mixed-use Employment 
Locations (MEL);
c. Maximising opportunities to deliver new 
and enhanced workspace, including through 
appropriate mixed-use development in town 
and edge-of-centre locations and non-
designated employment sites;
d. Outside of SIL, avoiding development that 
consists solely or predominantly of Class B8 
storage or warehousing uses unless:
i. The site is currently solely or 
predominantly in storage and warehousing 
use; and
ii. Redevelopment proposals comprise of 
intensification of storage and warehousing 
uses and/or employment generating uses 
appropriate to the site; ande. Ensuring development  does not result 
in a net loss of viable industrial capacity, 
whether this is existing or consented but 
not built, having regard to other Local Plan 
policies.
C Outside of designated employment areas the 
appropriateness of development proposals for 
new Class E(g) office and light industrial, Class 
B2 industrial, Class B8 storage and distribution 
and similar Sui Generis Uses will be assessed 
having regard to the nature and scale of the 
development and:
a. Its contribution to the delivery of the spatial 
strategy for the Borough;
b. Compatibility of the proposed use(s) with 
the adjoining and neighbouring land uses, 
including consideration of impacts on local 
amenity; 
c. Whether the employment provision is for 
temporary use; and
d. Compliance with other Local Plan policies.
D Planning conditions will be used to protect 
new commercial and industrial development 
from changes of use.
E Where new business floorspace is conditioned 
for a specific use, changes to another 
commercial or industrial use appropriate 
for the site and employment area will only 
be permitted where there is no reasonable 
prospect of the unit(s) being retained for the 
conditioned use. This must be evidenced by a 
robust and recent marketing exercise covering 
a minimum continuous period of twelve-
months at a reasonable rental or sale value for 
the local area. All such changes of use must 
comply with other Local Plan policies.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TURETable 8.1: Lewisham’s Employment Land Hierarchy
214Explanation
8.5 This policy establishes Lewisham’s employment 
land hierarchy which comprises the different 
types of employment land and sites in the 
Borough. The safeguarding of land within this 
hierarchy is necessary to ensure a sufficient 
supply of land and industrial capacity to meet 
the Borough’s current and future needs for 
employment. 
8.6 Designated employment locations include SILs, 
as set by the London Plan, and several types of 
locally strategic sites which are LSIS, MELs. The 
successful delivery of the spatial strategy for 
the Borough is dependent on new employment 
development being directed to these locations, 
along with town centres. Development proposals 
should maximise opportunities to intensify and 
make a more efficient use of land, whilst ensuring 
the type and nature of uses is commensurate 
with the site’s place in the employment land and 
town centre hierarchies, where relevant. 
8.7 Lewisham has a small amount of employment 
land when compared to other London boroughs. 
This limited supply has been diminished through 
significant and incremental losses of industrial 
capacity over recent years. Some of this loss 
can be attributed to plan-led consolidation 
and release of land to support regeneration, 
particularly through mixed-use redevelopment 
of MELs  in the north of the Borough. However, 
beyond this plan-led process the Borough’s 
other employment sites and premises are facing 
increased pressure for redevelopment from other 
higher value land uses, particularly housing. This pressure has been amplified by changes to 
planning legislation, for example, new Permitted 
Development rights enabling the conversion 
of offices and warehouses to residential uses 
through the Prior Approval process.
8.8 The London Plan directs the Local Plan to retain 
Lewisham’s existing industrial capacity. In order 
to meet the Borough’s future employment 
needs it will be necessary to not only safeguard 
designated and non-designated employment 
sites but to intensify uses on them. The Local 
Plan therefore seeks to facilitate a restructuring 
of the employment land stock to increase 
employment densities, create additional industrial 
capacity and diversify uses within employment 
areas. This will also help to create more local jobs 
and training opportunities across the Borough.
8.9 The London Plan provides in-principle 
support for the co-location of employment 
and other compatible uses on sites that are 
released from SIL and within LSIS, but only 
where this is facilitated through the plan-led 
process. Informed by findings of the Lewisham 
Employment Land Study (2019), the Local Plan 
helps give effect to London Plan policies E5 
(Strategic Industrial Locations) and E7 (Industrial 
intensification, co-location and substitution). 
Further requirements are set out in Local Plan 
policies EC5 (Strategic Industrial Locations) and 
EC6 (Locally Significant Industrial Sites) along 
with corresponding site allocation policies.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TURE8.10 Our expectation is that there will be no net loss 
of industrial capacity in the Borough and that net 
gains are delivered wherever possible. Industrial 
capacity in Lewisham will be calculated on the 
basis of the existing commercial and industrial 
capacity on a site which is currently in active 
employment use, and covers Class E(g) office 
and light industrial, Class B2 industrial, Class 
B8 storage and distribution and related Sui 
Generis uses. Where a proposed development 
site is vacant or cleared, the existing capacity 
should be established on the basis of the last 
active authorised commercial and industrial 
use(s) (excluding meanwhile uses). The existing 
capacity figure should also take into account 
any unimplemented authorised changes of use 
permitted through the Prior Approval process 
(which would effectively be discounted from 
the existing capacity). Whilst the integration of 
mezzanines are broadly supported by the Local 
Plan as a way to make a more optimal use of 
land, mezzanine space will be excluded from 
calculations of industrial capacity for the purpose 
of this policy.
8.11 Development proposals should retain industrial 
capacity and seek net gains through site 
intensification, including additional floorspace, 
wherever possible and appropriate. However it 
is recognised that net gains may not always be 
feasible. For instance, some types of industrial 
uses require a significant amount of operational 
yard or servicing space to function effectively. The onus will be on the applicant to demonstrate 
that the design-led approach has been used 
to make the optimal use of land and maximise 
employment provision. This should include 
evidence of alternative design options, such as 
site layouts and building typologies (including 
multi-storey or basement development). 
8.12 Lewisham’s Employment Land Study (2019) has 
informed the strategic employment floorspace 
requirement that the Local Plan will address 
over the plan period. It suggests that there is 
additional need for some 21,800 square metres 
of office floorspace up to 2038. This type of 
floorspace is normally associated with Use 
Classes E(g)(i) and E(g)(ii)74.  However, the study 
emphasises that office development is not a 
homogenous product, pointing to the wide range 
of workspace typologies now available (such 
as serviced offices, incubators, accelerators and 
co-working space). Further, continuing shifts 
in modern commercial practices mean sectors 
that might traditionally have been thought of as 
office sectors can be found occupying ‘hybrid’ 
space in re-purposed industrial premises. In 
short, there is increasing fluidity in the workspace 
market and some office uses do not fit neatly 
into the Use Class Order categories. Therefore, 
the Council will take a broader view to planning 
for its future employment floorspace needs.     
74   Following the publication of the Lewisham Employment 
Land Study (ELS) 2019, the Town and Country Planning 
(Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 
have come into force. These effectively bring Use Classes 
B1(a), B1(b) and B1(c) into a new Use Class E (Commercial, 
Business and Service), The former Class B1 uses are now 
Class E(g)(i), E(g)(ii) and E(g)(iii) respectively. Where 
the ELS refers Class B1 Uses, the Local Plan reflects the 
corresponding Class E categories for consistency with 
planning legislation.
216We will promote the full complement of Class E(g) 
uses, including E(g)(iii) light industrial uses, to 
ensure that the Local Plan does not unnecessarily 
constrain employment development. Development 
proposals for Class B2 industrial and B8 storage 
or distribution uses should be located within SIL 
and elsewhere where specified by the Local Plan. 
Industrial capacity will be closely monitored over 
the plan period to ensure our policy objectives are 
being realised. 
8.13 Recent changes to planning legislation have 
extended the scope of Permitted Development 
rights75. This means that some commercial uses, 
such as Class E business uses, can be changed to 
Class C3 housing without the need for planning 
permission, subject to a Prior Approval process. 
Likewise, there is greater flexibility for changes 
between Class E business uses, for example 
from office and light industrial to retail, food 
and beverage, and professional services. Whilst 
recognising the flexibility and benefits offered by 
the new Class E in some parts of the Borough, 
particularly town centres, it is vital to plan 
positively for the Borough’s needs for industrial 
capacity. The Council will therefore use planning 
conditions, attached to new planning permissions, 
to remove any applicable Permitted Development 
rights and restrict changes via section 55(2) of 
the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). This will ensure that new commercial 
and industrial development is secured for this 
specific use and to protect the economic function 
of SIL, LSIS, MEL and other employment sites. 
The Council will also monitor development 
activity and consider the need to introduce 
Article 4 Directions to help protect the economic 
function and amenity of employment areas76. 
75 This includes changes to the Town and Country 
Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) 
Regulations 2020 and amendments to the Town and 
Country Planning (General Permitted Development) 
(England) Order 2015.76 This is a direction under Article 4 of the General 
Permitted Development Order (GDPO) which enables 
the Secretary of State or the local planning authority to 
withdraw specified permitted development rights across a 
defined area.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TURE218Opposite: Cannon Wharf Business CentreEC3 High quality employment areas and workspace
A Development proposals for Class E business, 
B2 industrial and B8 storage or distribution 
uses and related Sui Generis uses must be 
of a high quality design with well-integrated 
and purpose built business space. They must 
demonstrate how the design-led approach has 
been used to improve the site’s suitability for 
business activity having regard to the type and 
use of space. Development proposals must:
a. Optimise the use of land and maximise 
opportunities to increase job densities;
b. Make provision for an appropriate level 
of internal fit out beyond shell and core, 
including:
i.  Connection-ready high speed 
broadband;
ii. Installation of mechanical and electrical 
services;
iii. Toilets and kitchenette;
iv. Internal surface finishing and blinds;
v. Basic fire and carbon monoxide 
detection; and
vi. Shopfronts and glazing, where 
appropriate. 
c. Make provision for flexible workspace that 
can be adapted to the needs of different 
employment uses, particularly where there 
is not a specified end user;
d. Ensure the layout and design of 
development provides adequate operational 
space including for site access and servicing; 
e. Improve the attractiveness and 
environmental quality of the site and 
employment area, including high quality 
public realm, where appropriate; andf. Ensure a coherent and positive relationship 
with adjoining and neighbouring land uses 
and protect local amenity, with reference to 
other Local Plan policies. 
B Development proposals for new Class E(g), 
B2, B8 and similar Sui Generis uses over 2,500 
square metres (gross external area) must 
include a reasonable proportion of flexible 
workspace or smaller units suitable for micro, 
small and medium sized enterprises.
C Within the Forest Hill Cultural Quarter, Endwell 
Road LSIS and Ashby Mews non-designated 
employment site, development proposals for 
new self-contained live-work units will only be  
permitted where it is demonstrated that they 
will not adversely impact on the character, 
function and effectiveness of the Cultural 
Quarter and LSIS to accommodate commercial 
and industrial uses, and will not result in a 
net loss of industrial capacity. Development 
proposals for new live-work units outside of 
these locations will be refused.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.14 The redevelopment of industrial land and other 
employment sites is necessary to meet local 
needs for modern business space as well as to 
support site renewal and regeneration. Most of 
Lewisham’s employment areas are located within 
or in close proximity to residential areas. New 
commercial development that is well-designed 
can not only improve the quality and viability 
of employment areas and premises but also 
the liveability of neighbourhoods. Commercial 
development proposals must therefore respond 
positively to the wider neighbourhood context 
by addressing matters such as local character, 
amenity, public realm and green infrastructure.
8.15 Development proposals must demonstrate 
how the design-led approach has been used to 
optimise and make more efficient use of land 
and commercial floorspace. This may include 
consideration of layout options to provide 
higher plot ratios and building designs to enable 
integration of smaller business units, co-working 
and incubator space, vertical stacking / multi-
storey development, mezzanines and basement 
levels. 
8.16 Flexibly specified buildings and workspaces 
should be provided wherever possible, 
particularly where there is not a specified end 
user for the development. These are essential to 
ensuring the long-term viability of employment 
land and premises. This is because they allow for 
the reconfiguration of internal space to suit  a 
wide range of end users and support business 
retention by enabling existing occupiers to 
expand in situ. Flexible specifications could also 
include, for example, full height delivery doors, capacity to site additional delivery doors to 
enable subdivision of buildings, and reallocation 
of space.
8.17 Development proposals must make appropriate 
provision for full internal fit out of buildings 
and workspace. This should normally include 
plumbing/heating, installation of sanitary and 
kitchen facilities, finishes for floors, walls and 
ceilings, and where appropriate, shopfronts and 
glazing. New development must also provide 
for modern communications facilities, including 
power points and connection-ready high speed 
broadband. Proposals should provide sufficient 
details of interior fit out at the application stage.
8.18 Proposals limited to 'core' and 'shell' only 
specifications are not considered appropriate 
and will be strongly resisted. This requirement 
is necessary to ensure the attractiveness and 
marketability of units, particularly in promoting 
early take up of workspace and helping to 
prevent long-term vacancies. It is also vital 
to supporting mirco, small and independent 
businesses which are unlikely to be in a position 
to absorb the initial overhead costs for fit out. 
The appropriate level of fit out will be considered 
on a site-by-site basis. 
8.19 Site layout is especially important for commercial 
and industrial operators. The effective 
functioning of employment sites is dependent 
not only on fit for purpose buildings but also 
their associated operational land. Development 
proposals must therefore address matters such 
as vehicle access for loading and delivery, yard 
space, external storage, parking, site servicing 
220and customer interface. A well-designed layout is 
also essential to ensuring the protection of local 
amenity.
8.20 Large scale commercial development proposals 
must incorporate a range of business unit sizes. 
The 2,500 square metre (gross external area) 
benchmark is established by the London Plan and 
given effect through this policy77.  Lewisham’s 
employment areas have very low vacancy rates 
which can make it difficult for businesses to find 
space to start up and grow. Provision for smaller 
units will help small business development 
particularly for Lewisham’s creative, cultural 
and digital industries. More than 90 per cent of 
businesses in Lewisham are small businesses78.  
What constitutes a reasonable proportion 
of flexible workspace or small units will be 
considered on a case-by-case basis.
8.21 Development proposals for new live-work units 
(i.e. residential and employment uses in the 
same self-contained unit for semi-permanent 
or permanent occupation) will be refused, 
unless they are located within the Forest 
Hill Cultural Quarter, Endwell Road LSIS or 
Ashby Mews, Brockley. Monitoring indicates 
the loss of employment provision through 
consenting live-work accommodation, with 
development reverting to fully residential use 
over time. This policy helps to guard against 
such loss, recognising the need to protect 
industrial capacity. Exceptions will be made 
for live-work development in the Forest Hill 
Cultural Quarter, Endwell Road LSIS and Ashby Mews, recognising that such provision has 
been successfully integrated into the area and 
contributes to its distinctiveness. In the case of 
mixed-use development including a commercial 
component, the employment floorspace must be 
demonstrably separate from other uses, including 
any residential elements, and dedicated solely to 
business uses.

EC4 Low-cost and affordable workspace 
A Development proposals incorporating 
workspace should ensure that provision is 
made for suitable types and sizes of units, at 
an appropriate range of rents, particularly to 
meet the needs of micro, small and medium 
sized businesses, including start-ups.
B Where there is existing low-cost workspace 
this should be retained or re-provided. 
Development proposals should use the 
design-led approach to explore options for 
retaining, re-purposing or creating new low-
cost workspace that is designed to a high 
specification and will remain suitable for 
local businesses, including small businesses 
and those in the cultural, creative and digital 
industries. Low-cost workspace should be let 
at reasonable local market rates to encourage 
take-up of units and support business 
development, particularly by addressing 
financial barriers in access to workspace.
C Development proposals that incorporate an 
element of affordable workspace at rents 
maintained below the market rate for social, 
cultural or economic uses will be considered 
favourably.
D New major commercial development proposals 
for Class E(g) office and light industrial, 
Class B2 industrial, Class B8 storage and 
distribution and similar Sui Generis uses must 
make provision for affordable workspace. 
Developments must provide at least 10per 
cent of the rentable floorspace (Net Internal 
Area) as affordable workspace at 50 per cent of market rents. Affordable workspace should 
be provided on-site. . . Off-site provision will 
only be acceptable where it is demonstrated 
to the satisfaction of the Council that on-site 
provision is not feasible or off-site provision 
will achieve greater economic benefits. 
Off-site provision will be secured through 
planning obligations with payments in lieu 
calculated using the formula set out in Table 
8.2 (Affordable workspace payments in lieu). 
Payment in lieu contributions will be used to 
support the provision of affordable workspace 
in Lewisham. Further details will be set out in 
the Planning Obligations SPD.

workspace provider approved by the 
Council, with an agreed Workspace 
Management Plan;
b. Managed directly by the owner, where 
it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of 
the Council that they have the necessary 
experience and expertise, with an agreed

c. Leased by the owner to an end user 
approved by the Council that requires non-
managed workspace.
F Development proposals that do not provide 
the required amount of affordable workspace 
must submit a Viability Assessment. The 
assessment will be subject to an independent 
appraisal paid for by the applicant. Proposals 
must provide the maximum viable amount of 
affordable workspace, the level of which will 
be determined by the Viability Assessment 
and capped at the requirement set out in (D) 
above. The Council will apply viability review 
mechanisms where development proposals do 
not provide the amount of workspace required 
by the policy.G Where there is existing affordable workspace 
this should be retained. Development 
proposals requiring planning permission 
that involve the loss of existing affordable 
workspace (including consented but 
undelivered workspace) will be refused 
unless the equivalent amount of affordable 
workspace is replaced on-site or re-provided 
elsewhere in Lewisham. Affordable workspace 
that is replaced or re-provided must be of at 
least the same quality as the existing provision 
and secured on equivalent terms, or alternative 
terms agreed by the Council. In applying this 
policy consideration will be given to affordable 
workspace that has been secured on a 
temporary basis as a meanwhile use.

the use of planning obligations and/or legal 
agreements. Further details will be set out in 
the Planning Obligations SPD.
224Explanation
8.22 Lewisham’s Employment Land Study (2019) 
and Local Economic Assessment (2019) identify 
rising commercial sales and rental rates and 
the lack of low-cost and affordable workspace 
as an important issue in the Borough.  . The 
cost and availability of workspace can create a 
barrier to entry in the local economy and wider 
community, posing challenges for businesses 
and groups seeking to locate to, start-up or 
expand in Lewisham. This is particularly for 
micro, small and independent businesses as well 
as social enterprises, charities and voluntary 
organisations.. The Local Plan therefore seeks 
to ensure that existing low-cost and affordable 
workspace is retained and that new provision 
is created as commercial development comes 
forward.
8.23 As set out in the London Plan, low-cost 
workspace refers to secondary and tertiary 
space that is available at open market rents, 
which is of a lower specification than prime 
space. This type of space is often located at the 
back of town centre sites, under railway arches 
and in smaller or constrained industrial sites. It 
accommodates traditional business sectors and, 
in Lewisham, has a key local role in supporting 
the cultural, creative and digital industries. 
Low-cost workspace has typically been scattered 
across town centres and areas such as New Cross 
and Deptford. Clusters are also present along the 
Overground line corridor, for example, around 
Forest Hill and Brockley stations. However, the 
availability of low-cost workspace is increasingly 
limited given the Borough’s diminishing 
employment land supply, rising market rates for 
commercial space and competing pressure on 
employment sites from higher value land uses.8.24 Affordable workspace is workspace that is 
provided at rents maintained below the market 
rate. Like low-cost workspace, this type of 
workspace is important to support business 
retention and development. For the successful 
delivery of the Local Plan there is an imperative 
to grow Lewisham’s economic base and provision 
of affordable workspace will be integral to 
achieving this. Therefore, all major commercial 
development, including mixed-use developments 
with a commercial component of 1,000 square 
metres or more gross, must ensure that 10 per 
cent of new workspace is delivered as affordable 
workspace. The level and rental rate of affordable 
workspace required by this policy can be viably 
delivered, as set out in the Lewisham Local Plan 
Viability Assessment (2022).
8.25 The policy applies to Use Class E(g) office and 
light industrial, B2 industrial and B8 storage and 
distribution uses. It will also apply to similar Sui 
Generis Uses however this will be considered on 
a case-by-case basis depending on the nature 
of the business activity. The Council will use 
discretion on a case-by-case basis in applying 
the policy to office space or other workspace that 
associated with community (social) infrastructure 
such as health, social care and education 
facilities. 
8.26  Affordable workspace must be let at a discount 
of 50 per cent of the market rent over a period 
agreed by the Council. The market rent is the 
expected rent that would be achieved on the 
discounted space at market rates. Market rates 
(and therefore rents) should be established on 
the basis of robust evidence of the commercial 
market in Lewisham. Service charges should be 
225
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREset at a reasonable level that does not offset 
or adversely impact on the affordability of the 
workspace. The market rent and associated 
service charges will be assessed by the Council 
at the time of the application, taking into 
account the nature and location of the proposed 
development.
8.27 Affordable workspace should normally be 
provided on-site. The policy sets out three 
options for delivering workspace to ensure it is 
appropriately secured and managed. Applicants 
should engage with workspace providers and 
representative groups, such as the Lewisham 
Workspace Providers Forum, early in the design-
led approach. This will help to ensure the design 
is suited to the requirements of the end user(s) 
and can also assist with the identification of 
providers. Applications should include evidence 
of an agreement to lease the affordable 
workspace along with a Workspace Management 
Plan, where appropriate. Flexibility may be 
applied for equivalent off-site contributions in 
exceptional circumstances, including payments in 
lieu, where it is demonstrated to the satisfaction 
of the Council that on-site provision is not 
feasible or off-site provision will provide greater 
economic benefits. Payment in lieu contributions, 
which will be secured using the formula set out 
in Table 8.2  (Affordable workspace payments in 
lieu).
8.28 Development proposals that do not provide 
the required amount of affordable workspace 
must submit evidence of a Viability Assessment 
with the planning application. This must  be 
undertaken by a suitably qualified professional, 
such as a member of the Royal Institution of 
Chartered Surveyors (RICS). The applicant’s Viability Assessment will be subject to an 
independent appraisal paid for by the applicant. 
The assessment will be used to confirm the 
maximum viable amount of affordable workspace 
that should be provided, with the level capped 
at the amount set out in Policy EC4.D. Where 
the required level of affordable workspace is 
not provided the Council will apply early and 
late stage viability review mechanisms. This is 
to respond to economic uncertainties that may 
arise over the period of the development, and to 
ensure maximum public benefit is gained from it.
8.29 It is expected that affordable workspace will 
normally be provided as flexibly specified office 
or light industrial workspace79. Developments 
will also be encouraged to make provision for 
this type of space to contribute to meeting the 
Borough’s identified needs for employment80.  
However there may be circumstances in which 
affordable workspace can be provided for 
Class B2 industrial or Class B8 storage and 
warehousing uses. In these cases a lower level of 
affordable workspace and/or discount rent may 
be permissible. This is recognising these types 
of industrial uses may exhibit lower land values, 
which can in turn impact on viability. Where 
appropriate, the amount of affordable workspace 
and discount rent value will be determined 
taking into account the nature of the use(s) and 
development viability.
79 The Lewisham Local Plan Viability Assessment (2022) 
has tested the viability of the policy on the basis of 
workspace being provided as office and light industrial 
floorspace.

B Development proposals within or adjacent 
to SILs must not adversely impact on the 
function or effectiveness of the SIL to 
accommodate commercial and industrial uses 
or their ability to function on a 24-hour basis.
C Development proposals within SIL should 
protect and seek to make provision for 
business activities and uses that support the 
function of London’s Central Activities Zone 
(CAZ).
D The reconfiguration of the Surrey Canal Road 
SIL is facilitated through the Local Plan. Land 
at the Bermondsey Dive-Under is designated 
SIL to provide substitute industrial capacity for 
the release of SIL at Apollo Business Centre, 
Trundleys Road and Evelyn Court. These sites 
released from SIL are re-designated as LSIS 
where the co-location of employment and 
other compatible uses will be supported in line 
with Policy EC6 (Locally Significant Industrial 
Sites) and relevant site allocation policies.

8.30 Lewisham contains two designated SILs at Surrey 
Canal Road and Bromley Road. The London Plan 
requires boroughs to proactively manage and 
sustain SILs as the region’s largest concentrations 
of industrial, logistics and related capacity for 
uses that support the functioning of London’s 
economy. This policy ensures that Lewisham’s 
SILs are safeguarded and their economic function 
is enhanced and not compromised by new 
development.
8.31 Lewisham’s SILs make up a significant proportion 
of the Borough’s industrial capacity and are key 
areas for business activity and local jobs. They are 
also well-positioned to play a more integral role 
in supporting the London CAZ81 which is a driver 
of the regional economy. Both SILs benefit from 
their proximity to central London and the wider 
south-east of England, including good transport 
connections. In addition, Lewisham features 
growth sectors which complement the CAZ, such 
as the cultural, creative and digital industries. 
Development proposals should protect and seek 
to make provision for activities and uses that 
support the CAZ. This includes industrial capacity 
for logistics and last mile distribution, ‘just-in-
time servicing’ and other related functions as SIL 
are the most appropriate locations in the borough 
for these types of activities.8.32 The New Cross Area Framework and Lewisham 
Employment Land Study (2019) identify 
opportunities to consolidate and intensify 
employment uses at Surrey Canal Road. To 
secure the long-term viability of industrial land 
within this area the reconfiguration of SIL is 
facilitated through the plan-led process. New 
SIL is designated at the Bermondsey Dive-Under 
which provides substitute capacity for SIL released 
at Apollo Business Centre, Trundleys Road and 
Evelyn Court. The South Bermondsey Dive-Under 
masterplan (2019) demonstrates that industrial 
development can feasibly be delivered there. 
Those sites released from SIL are re-designated as 
LSIS in order to ensure they continue to function 
principally as employment locations. Their 
redevelopment will provide a positive transition 
in character and use from the surrounding 
residential areas to the commercial and industrial 
core of the SIL. Further details are set out in 
Policy EC6 (Locally Significant Industrial Sites).

A LSIS will be protected for Class E(g) office 
and light industrial, Class B industrial, Class 
B8 storage and distribution and related Sui 
Generis uses, with priority being given to 
office and light industrial uses. Development 
proposals should ensure that there is no 
net loss of industrial capacity within these 
locations and seek to deliver net gains 
wherever possible. 
B Development proposals within or adjacent 
to LSIS must not adversely impact on the 
function or effectiveness of the LSIS to 
accommodate commercial and industrial uses.
C Within LSIS, development proposals for 
self-storage and large format storage and 
warehousing uses and facilities will only be 
permitted where:
a. The requirements of Policy EC2.B(d) 
(Protecting employment land and delivering 
new workspace) are satisfied; or
b. There is a demonstrable local need or 
market demand for the use proposed;
c. The use cannot be reasonably located in a 
SIL, as evidenced by a detailed site selection 
exercise; and
d. The development will include provision of a 
reasonable proportion of flexible workspace 
or units for micro, small or medium-sized 
businesses.
D The co-location of employment and other 
compatible uses will only be permitted at 
selected LSIS in order to secure the long-
term viability of LSIS and to help facilitate 
their renewal and regeneration. Development roposals involving the co-location of uses 
must not compromise the function of the LSIS 
in line with (B) above. Further development 
requirements are set out in site allocation 
policies for the following sites:
a. Apollo Business Centre
b. Blackheath Hill
c. Childers Street North
d. Clyde Vale
e. Evelyn Court
f. Lower Creekside
g. Manor Lane (Part)
h. Perry Vale
i. Stanton Square
j. Trundleys Road
k. Willow Way
l. Worsley Bridge Road
E Development proposals for the co-location of 
uses on LSIS sites listed in EC6.D above which 
result in the net loss of industrial capacity 
will be strongly resisted and only permitted in 
exceptional circumstances, where the proposal:
a. Suitably demonstrates that the loss is 
necessary for reasons of feasibility or 
to secure strategic infrastructure, with 
reference to Policy EC6.G , and the amount 
of industrial capacity has been maximised 
as much as reasonably practical, including 
through evidence of a development options 
appraisal considered through the design-led 
approach;
b. Will not compromise the function of the 
LSIS or preclude the delivery of the spatial 
strategy for the Borough;
c. Delivers wider public benefit(s) to overcome 
the loss of industrial capacity; and

proposals  which are not for Class E(g) office 
and light industrial, Class B industrial, Class B8 
storage and distribution and similar Sui Generis 
uses will only be supported where they:
a. Are not residential uses;
b. Are complementary and ancillary to

c. Will support the long-term viability of the 
LSIS as an employment location, including 
through provision of services and facilities 
that meet the needs of modern business;
d. Will not adversely impact on the function 
of the LSIS or prejudice the continued 
operation of commercial and industrial 
uses on the site, within the LSIS and in 
neighbouring employment areas, including 
those outside of the Borough; 
e. Do not result in an overconcentration of 
similar uses in the LSIS and its immediate or 
wider surrounds; and
f. Will not compromise the delivery of 
strategic requirements for industrial 
capacity, having regard to the proposal’s 
individual and cumulative impact. G Within LSIS, development proposals for 
strategic infrastructure will be permitted where 
it is demonstrated that:
a. The infrastructure is necessary to support 
the delivery of the spatial strategy for the 
Borough, taking into account the Council’s 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan;
b. The use is appropriate to the industrial 
location and will not adversely impact on 
the function of the LSIS or prejudice the 
continued operation of commercial and 
industrial uses on the site or within the 
employment area; and
c. The loss of industrial capacity has been 
minimised as much as reasonably practical 
and efforts have been made to replace any 
such losses.
230Explanation
8.33 LSIS play an important role in the local economy 
as a key source of the Borough’s industrial 
capacity and jobs. Lewisham’s Employment 
Land Study (2019) confirms the need to protect 
LSIS over the long-term and sites are therefore 
safeguarded by the Local Plan. New development 
within LSIS should be predominantly for Class 
E(g) office and light industrial uses with priority 
given to light industrial uses.
8.34 In order to make the optimal use of land there 
will need to be a managed process of industrial 
land renewal and intensification. The Lewisham 
Employment Land Study (2019) provides that 
the Borough’s future requirements are primarily 
for office and light industrial uses. To ensure 
LSIS help to meet these identified needs we will 
resist development proposals that consist solely 
or predominantly of self-storage or large format 
warehousing and storage facilities (normally 
included in the B8 Use Class) unless sufficiently 
justified Storage and warehousing uses can 
help to support the wider regional economy, 
particularly the logistics sector which is vital to 
the long-term viability of London’s CAZ. They 
also provide valuable space for smaller businesses 
and those requiring additional off-site provision. 
Development proposals  must demonstrate there 
is an identified need or local market demand for 
the warehousing or storage use and that there 
are no suitable or available sites in SIL, where this 
type of development can be more appropriately 
located. Proposals should include evidence of 
market research showing there is demand for the 
use and where possible, a specified occupier. This 
will help to prevent speculative developments 
for which there is unlikely to be an end-user. They should also submit a detailed site survey 
investigating availability of suitable sites both 
within and in proximity to Lewisham, including 
in neighbouring Boroughs and the London 
southeast sub-region. All development proposals 
for storage and warehousing must deliver a 
reasonable proportion of flexible workspace or 
units to meet needs of micro, small and medium 
sized business, the amount of which will be 
considered on a case-by-case basis.
8.35 To secure the long-term viability of LSIS and 
to help facilitate their renewal the Local Plan 
provides in-principle support for the co-location 
of employment and other complementary 
uses on selected sites, as identified in Policy 
EC6.D above. Site allocation policies have 
been prepared for these sites to ensure that 
co-location is coordinated and appropriately 
managed through the masterplan process, 
particularly to ensure that the function of the 
LSIS is not eroded by piecemeal development. 
Masterplans for LSIS should be prepared with 
reference to Policy DM3 (Masterplanning and 
comprehensive development) along with relevant 
London Plan guidance, including the Practice 
Note on industrial intensification and co-
location82.

Co-location Through Plan-led and Masterplan Approaches.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
8 ECONOMY AND CUL TURE8.36 Where the co-location of uses on LSIS identified 
in Policy EC6.D is proposed, development should 
be designed to ensure there is no net loss of 
industrial capacity with reference to Policy EC2 
(Protecting employment land and delivering 
new workspace), and to seek net gains wherever 
possible. The net loss of industrial capacity 
will only be considered in the exceptional 
circumstances set out in Policies EC5.E and 
EC5.G. Applicants must provide evidence to 
suitably demonstrate that the loss is necessary 
owing to reasons of feasibility and the loss has 
been minimised as much as reasonably practical. 
This must include evidence of different site 
layout, design and development typologies 
considered through the design-led approach. 
This includes consideration of impacts on the 
function and amenity of employment areas 
and industrial uses in proximity to the site, 
whether within or outside the Borough, as the 
benefits of agglomeration of compatible uses 
is often integral to the viability of employment 
land. Furthermore, to offset the loss of 
industrial capacity applicants will be required to 
demonstrate that a wider public benefit will be 
achieved through the scheme. Finally, proposals 
will be required to provide a minimum of 50 per 
cent of genuinely affordable housing on the 
residential element, in line with the London Plan 
policy H4 (Delivering affordable housing).8.37 Whilst LSIS is protected for office and industrial 
uses it is recognised that other employment 
generating ancillary uses can help to support the 
attractiveness and viability of an employment 
site. Such uses may include small-scale workplace 
crèches, cafes, business services, community 
facilities and public amenity spaces. The 
acceptability of development proposals for such 
uses will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
LSIS should remain attractive and viable places 
for business 
8.38 Development must not adversely impact on 
the function and effectiveness of LSIS or 
otherwise prejudice the continued operation of 
industrial and commercial uses. Development 
proposals should avoid harm to function of 
the LSIS by ensuring that they will not result 
in an overconcentration of non-commercial or 
inappropriate main town centre uses. Proposals 
will therefore be considered having regard to the 
cumulative impact of uses which are not Class 
E(g) office and other industrial uses. Many LSIS 
are located in proximity to town and local centres 
or transport hubs. Applications should therefore 
give consideration to the necessity of providing a  
main town centre use within the LSIS where there 
may be similar provision or available sites nearby.
232EC7 Mixed-use Employment Locations (MEL)
A The comprehensive redevelopment of 
Mixed-use Employment Locations will be 
supported in order to facilitate their renewal 
and regeneration and to secure provision 
for a range of commercial uses, including 
new modern workspacewith priority given to 
Class E(g) office and light industrial uses. All 
development proposals within MELs must 
be delivered in accordance with relevant site 
allocation policies and a site-wide masterplan. 
Development proposals must provide 
demonstrable improvements in the overall 
physical and environmental quality of the MEL 
and ensure that new development is well-
integrated with adjoining and neighbouring 
land uses.
B Development proposals must not adversely 
impact on the function or effectiveness 
of MELs to accommodate business uses. 
Development proposals must maximise 
the amount of Class E(g) office and light 
industrial uses through site redevelopment, 
provide a demonstrable and significant uplift 
in the number of jobs and make provision for 
high quality workspace, taking into account 
the operational requirements of differing 
land uses, in line with the Agent of Change 
principle and ensuring that the workspace is 
appropriately integrated within the MEL and 
its surrounding area.C Where the comprehensive development of 
an MEL, or a site within the MEL, has been 
delivered through the masterplan process all 
future proposals involving the redevelopment 
or change of use of land and floorspace must:
a. Retain, and wherever possible seek to 
increase, the proportion of industrial 
capacity  across the MEL, as originally 
approved in the masterplan and planning 
consent; and
b. Ensure there is no net loss of existing 
industrial capacity.
233
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.39 Mixed-use Employment Locations consist largely of 
older, poorer quality and redundant industrial land 
and buildings. To help facilitate regeneration in the 
north of the Borough the Local Plan makes provision 
for the plan-led consolidation and redevelopment 
of MELs. This will assist in tackling deprivation 
and inequality by improving the quality of the 
environment, delivering new housing (including 
affordable housing), jobs and training opportunities, 
and securing investment in infrastructure such as 
for public open space, community facilities and 
transport. 
8.40 A number of MELs have come forward for 
redevelopment in recent years (with building works 
having started and/or completed on some sites, and 
planning consent granted on others). The delivery of 
new modern workspace in mixed-use schemes has 
been demonstrated to be viable. Recently completed 
schemes have generated significant inward 
investment in the local area and enabled the renewal 
of MEL land. We therefore remain committed to the 
plan-led consolidation of MELs to support growth 
and regeneration, consistent with the London Plan 
objectives for Lewisham’s Opportunity Areas.
8.41 The Lewisham Employment Land Study (2019) 
provides that MELs should continue to be 
protected for employment generating uses. MELs 
are therefore safeguarded in line with Policy EC2 
(Protecting employment land and delivering new 
workspace), whilst recognising their ongoing role 
in supporting regeneration. This policy should be 
read in conjunction with relevant site allocation 
policies. These reflect the key role of MELs have in 
contributing to the delivery of the spatial strategy 
and supporting inclusive, healthy and liveable 
neighbourhoods in the Deptford and New Cross 
areas.8.42 Development proposals must be delivered 
through the masterplan process, with reference 
to Policy DM3 (Masterplans and comprehensive 
development). Proposals must demonstrate 
how they will maximise provision of industrial 
capacity whilst addressing the role MELs have 
in delivering a complementary mix of uses. This 
should include evidence of the site layout and 
design options explored through the design-led 
approach, along with consideration given to a 
different workspace typologies (for example, 
light industrial space or office space suitable for 
co-working).
8.43 Comprehensive redevelopment of MEL land 
must provide for a demonstrable uplift in the 
number of jobs, both within the site and across 
the MEL. Employment uplift will normally be 
considered against the applicant’s evidence of 
the number of jobs provided by the most recent 
authorised use on the site. Where land is vacant 
or a site has been cleared, the baseline jobs 
figure should be established using the last active 
authorised use. What comprises a ‘significant 
uplift’ in the number of jobs will be considered 
on a case-by-case basis, taking into account 
individual site circumstances.  At a minimum, 
applicants should demonstrate that the new 
development will deliver a higher employment 
density and an increase in the number of jobs. 
Notably, jobs secured during the planning, design 
and construction phases will not count towards 
the uplift, which must be calculated for the 
operational phase of development, and limited 
to on-site employment provision secured only. 
The quality of employment provision will also be 
taken into account when considering proposals.
2348.44 The comprehensive mixed-use redevelopment 
of some MEL sites has now been realised, for 
example, at Plough Way83. It is important that 
the new employment provision secured here, 
and at other such recently delivered MEL sites, 
is retained over the long term. Future proposals 
for redevelopment of any part of an MEL site, 
including changes of use, must not result in 
a net loss of the industrial capacity originally 
consented through the masterplan and planning 
approvals process. Where redevelopment or 
a change of use is acceptable in principle, 
development proposals should seek opportunities 
to provide net gains in workspace and jobs.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TURE236Opposite: Canvas and Cream Studios, Havelock Walk, Forest HillEC8 Non-designated employment sites
A Non-designated employment sites are those 
that contain or consist principally of Class E(g) 
office and light industrial, Class B industrial, 
Class B8 storage and distribution and similar 
Sui Generis uses, and which are located 
outside of SIL, LSIS and MEL. These sites 
make an important contribution to Lewisham’s 
local economy by providing workspace for 
businesses and job opportunities. Development 
proposals should protect and not result in the 
net loss of viable industrial capacity on these 
non-designated employment sites.
B To ensure the continued viability of non-
designated employment sites, development 
proposals for employment-led, mixed-used 
development will be supported where they 
are located within a well-connected area with 
high Public Transport Access Levels, or the site 
forms part of a cluster of commercial, industrial 
and/or other employment generating uses, and 
the development:
a. Maximises the amount of industrial capacity;
b. Provides demonstrable improvements in the 
site’s suitably for continued employment 
use, having particular regard to Policy 
EC3 (High quality employment areas and 
workspace);
c. Does not compromise the employment 
generating function of the site and any 
adjoining or nearby sites, particularly where 
they form part of a complementary cluster 
of uses; 
d. Ensures appropriate protection of amenity 
both for the users of the development and 
neighbouring properties, with reference to 
the Agent of Change principle; and
e. Secures the provision of affordable housing for any residential element introduced, 
including through building conversions, in 
line with Policy HO3 (Genuinely affordable 
housing).
C On all other non-designated employment 
sites (i.e. those which fall outside the location 
requirements in (B) above) development 
proposals must not result in the net loss of viable 
industrial capacity, unless it can be demonstrated 
that the building or site is not suitable for 
continued business use having regard to:
a. Feasible alternative commercial, industrial and/
or employment generating uses;
b. The condition of the existing building(s) and 
reasonable options for the refurbishment 
and/or reconfiguration of floorspace to 
enable continued occupation by employment 
generating uses;
c. Site constraints including layout, access and 
compatibility with neighbouring uses;
d. Long-term vacancy; and
e. Evidence of recent and continuous marketing, 
covering a minimum period of 24 months and 
at an appropriate rental or sale value.
D On sites where the introduction of a residential 
element is acceptable in line with (C) above, 
development proposals must make provision 
for affordable housing, in line with Policy HO3 
(Genuinely affordable housing).
E Development proposals involving the net loss 
of industrial capacity must make a financial 
contribution towards training or other 
employment related initiatives, in line with 
Policies EC10 (Workplace training and job 
opportunities) and DM2 (Infrastructure funding 
and planning obligations).

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.45 There are a number of employment sites located 
outside of the Borough’s designated employment 
areas These sites may either contain or consist 
principally of commercial and industrial uses. 
They play an important role in the local economy 
through their offer of complementary business 
services and activities as well as providing a 
source of local job opportunities. The Lewisham 
Employment Land Study (2019) and Council’s 
Authority Monitoring Reports indicate that 
these non-designated employment sites are 
under increasing pressure from higher value 
land uses, such as housing. There is a risk that 
the employment function of these sites will be 
compromised or lost without an appropriate 
level of protection. The Local Plan therefore 
seeks to safeguard these sites for employment 
use. However, it is recognised that flexibility is 
needed to respond to market signals, ensuring 
that land is not unnecessarily protected when 
there is no reasonable prospect of it remaining in 
employment use. In determining whether land is 
a non-designated employment site the Council 
will refer to planning and Business Rate records 
to identify whether the land and buildings are in 
business use, or were last authorised for business 
use.
8.46 To help maintain the viability of non-designated 
employment sites, the Local Plan provides 
support for employment-led, mixed-used 
redevelopment where a site is located within a 
well-connected area or forms part of a cluster 
of employment generating uses. This includes 
sites within town centre or edge-of-centre 
locations, or where several employment, retail or 
related community or cultural uses in proximity to one another form a cluster of complementary 
activities. A benchmark distance of 800 
metres (roughly 10-minutes walking distance) 
between uses will be applied as a guideline. 
All applications for such enabling development 
must be accompanied by an assessment that 
demonstrates the mixed-use scheme is necessary 
for reasons of financial viability (i.e. a non-
employment use is required to make employment 
development viable).  The Viability Assessment 
must be independently appraised and verified by 
a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) 
professional.
8.47 Development proposals must provide the 
maximum reasonable amount of floorspace 
taking account of the minimum amount of 
non-commercial floorspace needed to make 
development viable. Proposals should clearly 
set out the net change in industrial capacity 
resulting from the development, distinguishing 
between floorspace and yard space in the 
planning statement84, along with an indication of 
the number of jobs to be accommodated by the 
new employment element. Proposals should seek 
to increase employment densities to realise net 
gains in jobs even where the amount of industrial 
capacity is diminished.
84 This is necessary for monitoring purposes.
2388.48 Where enabling mixed-use development 
is proposed, is important that uses do not 
impact on the employment function of the 
site or inhibit its ability to continue supporting 
commercial uses, in line with the Agent of 
Change principle. Furthermore, development 
must make appropriate provision for flexible or 
adaptable workspace including an internal fit 
out of buildings, in line with the requirements of 
Policy EC3 (High quality employment areas and 
workspace). 
8.49 Elsewhere in the Borough, we will seek to 
safeguard viable non-designated employment 
sites for employment generating uses. Changes 
of use will only be permitted where it is 
satisfactorily demonstrated that a building or 
site is not viable for employment development, 
as justified through an active and continuous 
marketing campaign. In line with London Plan 
Supplementary Planning Guidance, the minimum 
time period for marketing should be for at 
least two years. However we may apply this 
requirement more flexibly based on individual 
site circumstances. 
8.50 Where development proposals involve the net 
loss of industrial capacity a financial contribution 
towards training or other employment related 
initiatives will be required, in line with Policies 
EC10 (Workplace training and job opportunities) 
and DM2 (Infrastructure funding and planning 
obligations).

b. An operational use associated with the 
railway or public highway; and
c. The use will not cause harm to the amenity

C Development proposals involving railway 
arches must be of a high quality design. 
Positive frontages must be provided in town 
and edge-of-centre locations and elsewhere 
wherever possible. Proposals must also 
investigate and maximise opportunities to 
improve accessibility by walking and cycling, 
including connections through arches where 
feasible and appropriate.
D Proposals involving the comprehensive 
redevelopment of sites that include, or are

arches must demonstrate they will not have 
an adverse impact on the public highway 
and railway network or preclude the 
delivery of planned transport infrastructure.

development and design options, where 
appropriate and/or required, through the 
design-led approach.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.51 There are a number of railways intersecting 
the Borough, some of which are supported by 
arches at points including within designated 
employment areas and town centres. There 
are opportunities to maximise the use of the 
space within these arches and the ancillary 
land adjacent to them. Many arches are already 
being used for a variety of commercial and 
industrial uses, with some providing low-cost and 
affordable workspace. This provision is important 
to smaller and independent businesses including 
those in the creative and cultural industries. We 
will support the continued use of arches in this 
way and work with stakeholders to maximise 
opportunities for new or enhanced workspace 
and commercial floorspace. Appropriate uses for 
railway arches will be determined on a case-by-
case basis having regard other Local Plan policies 
which set parameters for managing uses with 
town centres, designated employment locations 
and non-designated employment sites.
8.52 All development proposals should help to 
improve the quality of the environment, make 
a positive contribution to local character and 
protect the amenity of neighbouring properties. 
Where railways sever or impede local area 
connections, proposals will be expected to fully 
investigate opportunities to open up arches and 
introduce walking and cycle routes to improve 
accessibility. In the case of major applications, 
including the comprehensive redevelopment 
of sites, railway arches should be considered 
through the site masterplan process, even if the 
arches are not included within the development 
site boundary. This will help to ensure land and 
space is put to its optimal use and supports delivery of the spatial strategy. Applicants will be 
expected to consult Network Rail and Transport 
for London on development and design options 
in order to ensure there is no adverse impact on 
the public highway and rail network, or preclude 
the delivery of planned transport infrastructure, 
including the Bakerloo line extension.
242EC10 Workplace training and job opportunities 
A The Council will work with stakeholders, 
including the Mayor of London, the London 
Economic Action Partnership, and Lewisham 
Deal Partners to support the Local Plan 
objectives for delivering a thriving and 
inclusive local economy. 
B Development proposals  should make 
reasonable efforts to actively source local 
businesses, recruit local workers and provide 
workplace training, skills development, 
apprenticeships and other education and 
training opportunities for Lewisham residents. 
Consideration should be given to opportunities 
during the construction and end-user phases 
of development. Development proposals that 
demonstrate there are suitable arrangements 
in place to secure local labour and workplace 
training will be considered favourably.
C Major development proposals must make 
provision for workplace training in Lewisham. 
A financial contribution will be required 
using the formula set out in Table 8.3 . This 
will be secured by conditions or planning 
contributions and used to support the 
Council’s local labour scheme and associated 
projects.D In line with other Local Plan policies, 
development proposals involving a net loss of 
industrial capacity in designated employment 
locations and non-designated employment 
sites will be resisted, unless such loss is part 
of a p lan-led process of employment land 
consolidation. Where a development proposal 
will result in a net loss of industrial capacity, 
a financial contribution will be required for 
workplace training, using the formula set out 
in Table 8.3 . This will be secured by conditions 
or planning contributions and used to 
support the Council’s local labour scheme and

lifelong learning and have good access to these 
opportunities.
8.54 High unemployment levels, lower workplace 
earnings and deprivation persist in parts of 
the Borough because of certain barriers to 
employment that people experience.  This 
includes the lack or mismatching of skills that 
are required in the jobs market, which is rapidly 
evolving in response to new technologies 
as well shifts in the predominant business 
sectors of the regional and national economy. 
There are particular local issues with respect 
to adult literacy and numeracy, for example, 
which present barriers to access in the labour 
market. These issues have been amplified by the 
Covid-19 pandemic. The Government’s social 
distancing restrictions (including lockdowns) 
have adversely affected communities where 
a high proportion of the resident population 
was either furloughed or made redundant from 
the most affected sectors, and in places where 
entry level employment was traditionally already 
high. There is a growing body of research 
that indicates skills and training will be critical 
to supporting the economic recovery from 
Covid-1985.   8.55 The Council will promote a multi-stakeholder 
approach to help address the underlying causes 
of deprivation in a proactive way. We will 
support the London Mayor in delivering the the 
Skills for Londoners Strategy, which focusses 
on post-16 skills and adult education. We will 
also work with regional and local partnerships 
including Lewisham Deal partners. The Lewisham 
Deal is based on a community wealth building 
approach. It aims to boost investment in local 
small and medium sized enterprises and to help 
provide high-quality training and employment 
opportunities for local residents. Key focus 
areas include procurement, apprenticeships, 
employment and training guidance, and the 
London Living Wage.
8.56 Applicants, developers and business owners 
are encouraged to recruit local labour, source 
local businesses and provide residents with 
opportunities for workplace training and 
skills development, such as apprenticeships. 
Consideration should be given to sourcing at 
all stages in the development process, and 
particularly in the construction and operational 
phases. This will not only benefit residents but 
the use of local labour and business can also 
support the Circular Economy and limit the 
environmental impact of new development, 
for example, by helping to reduce the need for 
long distance commuting and the transport of 
materials.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TURE8.57 Major developments provide greater scope for 
local jobs and training opportunities, and all 
such proposals will be expected to demonstrate 
how they will contribute to meeting the policy 
objectives. Major commercial and residential 
developments must make a financial contribution 
to workplace training using the formula set 
out in Table 8.3  (Financial contributions for 
workplace training). The requirements have 
been viability tested in the Lewisham Local Plan 
Viability Assessment (2022). Further details on 
financial and non-financial contributions towards 
workplace training will be set out in the Planning 
Obligations SPD.
8.58 In line with other Local Plan policies on industrial 
land management, the Council will seek that 
development proposals retain industrial capacity 
to ensure the Borough’s needs for workspace are 
met. Development proposals resulting in the loss 
of industrial capacity must make compensatory 
provision for employment lost. This will be 
secured through a financial contribution, using 
the formula set out in Table 8.3  (Financial 
contributions for workplace training). The Council 
may apply this policy flexibly on a case-by-case 
basis, for example, with development proposals 
within Mixed-use Employment Locations 
where the consolidation of employment land is 
supported and managed through the plan-led 
process.
246EC11 Town centres at the heart of our communities 
A Town centres are and should remain at 
the heart of Lewisham’s neighbourhoods 
and communities as focal points for retail, 
commercial, cultural, leisure, community and 
civic activities. Town centres will be managed 
positively in order to ensure they are inclusive, 
diverse, attractive and vibrant places that are 
made more resilient and adaptable to future 
challenges and opportunities, including those 
presented by new technology and changes in 
consumer behaviour, such as online shopping.
B Development proposals should support and 
help to secure the long-term vitality and 
viability of Lewisham’s town centres by:
a. Optimising the use of land within and 
around them;
b. Maintaining and enhancing their distinctive 
features and characteristics where these 
make a positive contribution to the 
neighbourhood, including their built 
form, environmental, historic and cultural 
character;
c. Ensuring they are inclusive, safe and healthy 
places by creating environments that are 
barrier-free and accessible to all, with high 
quality buildings, spaces and public realm 
that are designed to:
i. Reduce vehicular dominance and 
promote and enable movement by 
walking, cycling and the use of public 
transport;ii. Encourage street level activity along with 
opportunities for social interaction and 
relaxation, including through provision of 
publicly accessible open space; and
iii. Maximise opportunities to deliver new or 
enhanced green infrastructure, including 
by urban greening and river restoration;
d. Delivering an appropriate mix and balance 
of residential and main town centre uses in 
order to attract visitors and ensure people 
have good access to a competitive range of 
services and facilities, as well as to support 
businesses and grow the local economy 
through provision of a wide range of 
workspaces and premises; and
e. Ensuring town centres function as vibrant 
places of daytime, evening and night-time 
activities.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.59 Town centres are at the heart of Lewisham’s 
neighbourhoods and communities. They all 
have distinctive features that reflect and help to 
reinforce the Borough’s character and diversity. 
Town centres are also a key part of the local 
economy and important hubs of daytime, 
evening and night-time activity.  The delivery of 
the spatial strategy for the Borough is dependent 
on a well-functioning network of town centres.  
Development proposals must therefore 
demonstrate how they will support their long-
term vitality and viability. 
8.60 Lewisham has a well-functioning network of 
town centres that meet the daily needs of local 
residents, workers, students and other visitors. 
However some centres are performing better 
than others, as evidenced by our latest town 
centre ‘health checks’, which look at indicators 
such as vacancy rates, types of business and 
mix of uses86. The Local Plan seeks to prevent 
the decline of the Borough’s High Streets 
and centres and makes clear the integral role 
they have in supporting Good Growth. It is 
important that town centres are lively, attractive 
and inclusive places that people can access 
safely and easily by walking, cycling and public 
transport. They should be places where people 
are able to live and encouraged to visit, with 
plenty of opportunities for leisure and relaxation 
throughout the daytime, evening and night-time. 
Development proposals must therefore respond 
positively to the character and environmental 
quality of town centres and secure the delivery of 
high quality buildings and public realm.8.61 There is a need to ensure that town centres 
remain resilient and adaptable to the challenges 
and opportunities facing the Hhigh Street, 
including changes in consumer behaviour and 
business practices. Brexit and Covid-19 have had 
significant short-term effects on the national, 
regional and local economies and are likely 
to have long-term implications, which require 
monitoring. This is particularly in terms of the 
retail sector where Covid-19 has led to a spike 
in town centre vacancies and accelerated trends 
in multi-channel (online) shopping87.  Whilst 
recognising that town centres play a key role in 
the provision of local shops and services, it is 
important that they are able to evolve and adapt 
over time, so that they continue to support our 
neighbourhoods and communities. The Local 
Plan provides support for a wide range of uses 
to locate within town centres as diversification is 
vital to their revitalisation, adaptability and long-
term resilience.

Trends Report (2021).
248EC12 Town centre network and hierarchy 
A Development proposals must support and 
reinforce Lewisham’s town centre network and 
hierarchy. They must demonstrate how the 
development will maintain and enhance town 
centre vitality and viability commensurate 
with the role and function of the centre, 
in accordance with Table 8.2 , along with 
responding positively to its distinctive 
character.
B A ‘town centres first’ approach will be used to 
assess development proposals for main town 
centre uses, in line with the London Plan and 
the NPPF . The Sequential Test will be applied 
to ensure that main town centre uses are 
directed to locations within town centres or, 
if no suitable town centre sites are available 
or expected to become available within a 
reasonable period, to appropriate edge-of-
centre locations. 
C The Sequential Test will not apply to Class 
F1 learning and non-residential institutions 
and Class F2 local community uses, however 
development proposals for these uses are 
encouraged to locate in town centres and 
other well-connected areas.
D Development proposals for new main town 
centre uses in out-of-centre locations will be 
refused unless provision has been made for 
these uses within the Local Plan, including 
site allocations, or it is clearly demonstrated 
that no suitable town or edge-of-centre sites 
are available or expected to become available 
within a reasonable period. E Retail Impact Assessments (RIAs) will be required 
to be submitted with development proposals for 
main town centre uses of 500 square metres gross 
floorspace or more at edge-of-centre and out-of-
centre locations, unless provision for main town 
centre uses has been made in a site allocation. 
RIAs should be proportionate to the nature and 
scale of development. Development proposals will 
be refused unless an RIA demonstrates that:
a. There is an identified need and market 
demand for the amount and type of floorspace 
proposed; and
b. The proposal, either by itself or in combination 
with other existing, committed or planned 
development, will not adversely impact on the 
vitality and viability of Lewisham’s town centre 
network and hierarchy and its wider catchment.
F Development proposals within town centres 
should contribute to the delivery of and support 
the appropriate distribution of retail uses to 
help ensure the Borough’s future need for 8,400 
additional gross square metres of retail floorspace 
up to 2035 is met.  Proposals for new major Use 
Class E(a) retail development should prioritise 
Lewisham and Catford Major Centres in the 
site selection process before considering other 
appropriate locations, including District Centres.
G Development within Lewisham town centre and its 
surrounds will be proactively managed in order to 
secure its future reclassification as a Metropolitan 
centre in the London Plan.  Development 
proposals should direct new investment and 
facilitate the delivery of strategic infrastructure 
to ensure the centre can effectively serve a local 
and wider sub-regional catchment, with reference 
to Policy LCA2 (Lewisham Major Centre and 
surrounds).

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.62 This policy establishes the Borough’s town 
centre hierarchy and describes the main role 
and function of the centres within it. The 
London Plan classifies Metropolitan, Major and 
District town centres whereas Local Centres 
are designated by the Local Plan. Shopping 
parades and other neighbourhood service nodes, 
including corner shops, are included in the 
hierarchy given their complementary function but 
are not formally designated.  The boundaries of 
the designated town centres within this hierarchy 
are shown on the Policies Map, along with the 
corresponding Primary Shopping Areas for Major 
and District Centres.
8.63 Development proposals must help to facilitate 
the delivery of the Borough’s spatial strategy 
by supporting and reinforcing Lewisham’s town 
centre network and hierarchy. The nature and mix 
of uses along with the design of development 
should be commensurate with the scale, role, 
function and character of a town centre within 
the hierarchy. Development proposals must 
demonstrate how they will support town centre 
vitality and viability by responding positively 
to the distinctive character and unique role 
of a centre in supporting the neighbourhoods 
and communities within its catchment, which 
may cover areas both within and outside of the 
Borough.8.64 Lewisham Major Centre is the Borough’s principal 
shopping and leisure destination and contains 
an important public transport node. The Major 
Centre it is undergoing significant transformation 
and offers the potential to be reclassified as a 
Metropolitan centre in the future, as indicated 
by the London Plan. The town centre already 
benefits from excellent public transport links, and 
has been identified as a ‘strategic interchange’ in 
the London Mayor’s Transport Strategy88.  
8.65 Catford Major Centre is distinguished by its 
unique civic and cultural functions along with 
a distinctive local and historic character. The 
Local Plan seeks to reinforce and build upon its 
strengths through targeted regeneration and 
renewal, including new and improved transport 
infrastructure and public realm enhancements. 
The Council’s Catford Town Centre Framework 
(2021) sets out a vision and strategy to make the 
town centre London’s greenest, which has both 
informed and will help to support the delivery of 
the Local Plan.
8.66 Part 3 of the Local Plan includes additional 
policies for the Borough’s Major, District and 
Local centres. It sets out how new development 
within these centres will be managed in order 
to facilitate the delivery of Good Growth and 
liveable neighbourhoods, consistent with the 
spatial strategy for the Borough, Site allocation 
policies have been included for strategic 
development sites within and at the edge of 
town centres.
88 Mayor’s Transport Strategy (2018). Greater London 
Authority.
2548.67 This policy sets out the ‘town centre first’ 
approach for the location of main town centre 
uses as defined by the NPPF . Such uses should 
be directed to the Borough’s designated town 
centres or if necessary, appropriate edge-of-
centre locations (unless provision for such uses 
have been made elsewhere by the Local Plan). 
Development proposals will be assessed in 
accordance with the Sequential pproach Test to 
site selection set out in the NPPF and London 
Plan.
8.68 Outside of designated centres, Retail Impact 
Assessments will be required for proposals of 500 
square meters gross floorspace or more, unless 
provision for retail uses has been made through 
a Local Plan site allocation. This local threshold 
is more rigorous than that set by national policy 
and is informed by local evidence89.  It provides 
wider scope for the consideration of proposals 
that could adversely impact on Lewisham’s town 
centre hierarchy and compromise delivery of the 
spatial strategy.
8.69 For the Sequential Test, flexibility will be 
applied to proposals for Class E(g) office 
uses, recognising that these uses will also 
be acceptable in designated employment 
areas, consistent with Policy EC2 (Protecting 
employment land and delivering new workspace).8.70 With the levels of growth planned in the 
Borough up to 2040, it is important that 
neighbourhoods and local communities are 
appropriately supported with good provision 
of shops, services and community facilities.  
The Lewisham Retail Impact Assessment and 
Town Centre Trends Report (2021) (‘Town 
Centre Trends Report’) includes an assessment 
of retail floorspace needs in the Borough. The 
study has taken into account information on 
the impacts of Brexit and Covid-19. It indicates 
that there is modest long-term scope for new 
retail development within Lewisham, over and 
above existing commitments (i.e. consented but 
undelivered developments). The report projects 
that an additional 8,397 gross square metres of 
floorspace will be required up to 203590. This 
overall total comprises +10,641 square metres 
for convenience goods, -3,651 for comparison 
goods and +1,407 for food and beverage 
retail. The site allocations included in Part 3 
of the Local Plan set parameters for specific 
sites in order to ensure that new development 
contributes to meeting these identified needs. 
They make provision for ‘main town centre uses’, 
which include retail uses, in order to respond 
to the flexibility provided by the new Use Class 
E (Commercial, business and service uses) in 
the Use Classes Order. Delivery against the 
retail floorspace target will be reviewed in the 
Authority Monitoring Report.  
89 The Lewisham Retail Impact Assessment and Town 
Centre Trends Report (2021) concludes that the 2,500 
square metre gross threshold set in national policy is 
inappropriate for Lewisham and that a lower threshold 
should be used.90 The report recommends that this figure is used as 
a broad guide rather than a rigid target. The figure is 
included in Policy EC11 as a benchmark to support the 
plan-led approach to meeting objectively assessed needs 
for retail, consistent with the NPPF.  
255
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
8 ECONOMY AND CUL TURE8.71  The Town Centre Trends Report recommends 
that, over the short-to-medium term, priority 
should be given to the re-occupation of vacant 
units to meet retail floorspace needs. Whilst 
the Local Plan broadly supports this approach 
it is also recognised that some vacant units 
may not be well-suited to modern businesses 
or retail occupiers, for example, owing to the 
size, configuration and quality of floorspace or 
ancillary facilities. There are also opportunities 
deliver new or re-purposed and higher quality 
retail units, along with other complementary 
uses, through the redevelopment of buildings 
and sites. The Local Plan therefore identifies 
specific locations within town centres where the 
comprehensive mixed-use redevelopment of sites 
will be supported.
8.72 The Town Centre Trends Report also suggests 
that the redevelopment of out-of-centre retail 
parks may assist in re-balancing floorspace 
provision across the Borough. The oversupply 
of retail floorspace in some areas may be 
redressed by rationalising out-of-centre retail 
parks which in turn can provide greater scope 
for new retail development in town centres. There are established out-of-centre retail 
parks in Lewisham including at Bell Green and 
Bromley Road. The Local Plan includes policies 
to facilitate the comprehensive redevelopment of 
these retail parks in order to support the vitality 
and viability of the Borough’s town centres whilst 
delivering a wider range of beneficial uses at 
these sites, including new housing. This approach 
is supported by the London Plan91. It directs 
that Local Plans should seek opportunities to 
redevelop out-of-centre retail parks in order to 
support the town centre hierarchy and make a 
more optimal use of land. 
91  London Plan (2021), Policy SD7 (Town centres: 
Development principles and Development Plan 
Documents).
256EC13 Optimising the use of town centre land and floorspace
A Development proposals should optimise the 
use of land and floorspace within town centres 
and at edge-of-centre locations by:
a. Delivering new mixed-use schemes on 
individual sites and through comprehensive 
redevelopment of multiple sites, where 
appropriate;
b. Investigating opportunities for the reuse 
and reconfiguration of existing space, or the 
provision of new additional space above or 
below commercial units; and
c. Avoiding designs that comprise of single-
storey development.
B Within town centres and edge-of-centre 
locations, mixed-use development 
proposals (including the expansion, reuse or 
reconfiguration of existing floorspace) will be 
considered having regard to:
a. The role and function of the centre;
b. Impact on town centre vitality and viability;
c. Compatibility of the proposed use with 
adjoining and neighbouring uses, both in 
terms of land use and character; and
d. Compliance with other policies.
C Subject to (A) and (B) above, where a 
development proposal includes a residential 
use the development must:
a. Not adversely impact on the function, 
appearance and character of the town 
centre, including its shopping and other 
frontages; and
b. Provide adequate access arrangements 
for all of the building occupiers including 
separate secured access for the residential 
element.D Development proposals affecting an existing 
commercial unit must ensure any ancillary 
floorspace that is integral to business 
operations and viability of the unit is not 
compromised or lost.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.73 Town centres are key locations for supporting 
growth and regeneration in Lewisham 
and provide unique opportunities for new 
development to optimise the use of land. This 
includes backland and infill sites, underused or 
vacant upper storeys of existing town centre 
buildings and airspace above relatively low-
density or single-storey commercial uses. These 
spaces can help to accommodate a range of uses 
to meet local needs including for workspace, 
community facilities and housing.
8.74 Development proposals for new single-storey 
development within and at the edge of town 
centres will be strongly resisted as this form 
of development is not considered to make the 
optimal use of the Borough’s limited land supply. 
This is because town centres are locations that 
are better suited to a wider mix of uses and 
where higher levels of density are normally 
appropriate. However it is recognised that for 
some uses a multi-storey format may not be 
deliverable owing to issues of compatibility of 
use(s), fit with local character, site constraints 
or development viability. Where single-storey 
buildings are proposed, applicants must provide 
a statement and supporting evidence to clearly 
justify why a multi-storey development is not 
appropriate or deliverable. Where Viability 
Assessments are submitted they must be 
independently appraised and verified by a 
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) 
professional.8.75 Mixed-use development may involve the 
intensification or reconfiguration of existing 
buildings and sites. Development and design 
parameters for strategic town centre sites are 
included in Part 3 of the Local Plan. Elsewhere, 
proposals for higher density mixed-use 
development will need to demonstrate that they 
are compatible with the role and function of the 
centre within which they are located, and comply 
with other policies.
8.76 All development proposals, including changes of 
use, should ensure that the amount and quality 
of ancillary floorspace within a commercial 
unit is retained or enhanced. This includes 
space for storage, back office functions and 
amenities, such as toilets and cleaning facilities. 
It is important that development does not 
compromise the continued business operation 
or long-term viability of existing commercial 
premises, whether through the reconfiguration of 
space or site redevelopment. 
258EC14 Major and District Centres
A Development proposals within and at the 
edge of a Major or District centre must 
demonstrate how they will support the vitality 
and viability of the town centre and make a 
positive contribution to its local character, with 
reference to Policy EC11 (Town centres at the 
heart of our communities). 
Primary Shopping Areas
B Primary Shopping Areas (PSAs) are the 
locations within Lewisham’s Major and District 
centres where retail uses are and should be 
concentrated. Development proposals should 
support the retail function of the PSA. New 
Class E(a) retail uses are encouraged to locate 
in the PSA in order to support and enhance 
town centre vitality and viability through the 
provision of a complementary cluster of retail 
uses.
C Development proposals for Class E and main 
town centre uses which do not contribute 
to the retail function of the PSA at the 
ground floor level must submit a Shopping 
Area Impact Statement. The statement must 
demonstrate that the development, whether 
individually or cumulatively with others, will 
support the retail function of the PSA and will 
not result in an unacceptable adverse impact 
on it by:
a. Contributing to the vitality, viability, 
vibrancy and character of the PSA, including 
by ensuring that a range of consumer 
goods remain available within it, taking into 
account the role and function of the centre 
in the hierarchy;b. Providing an appropriate main town centre 
use at the ground floor level that will attract 
visitors and generate footfall within the 
PSA; 
c. Providing a positive frontage along with 
an active ground floor frontage in order to 
ensure that there is no excessively harmful 
break between retail uses and the continuity 
of the active frontage; and
d. Ensuring local amenity is not unreasonably 
harmed by increased noise, odour, fumes 
and other nuisances.
D In Lewisham Major centre, development 
proposals should support the role and function 
of the centre by contributing to the target 
for the PSA to maintain a minimum of 50 
per cent of retail uses as a proportion of all 
units. Development proposals that will result 
in the percentage of retail uses in the PSA 
falling below this threshold target will only be 
supported where the retail function of the PSA 
will not be adversely impacted, with reference 
to (C) above.
E Planning conditions may be used to secure 
Class E(a) uses that contribute to the retail 
function of the PSA. Where retail development 
is conditioned for that use, development 
proposals seeking a change to another 
appropriate main town centre use, including 
full flexibility for Class E commercial, business 
and service uses, must demonstrate that there 
is no reasonable prospect of the unit being 
used for continued retail use. This must be 
evidenced by a robust and recent marketing 
exercise covering a minimum continuous

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREperiod of 6-months at a reasonable market 
value for rent or sale to the local area. 
Shopping Area Impact Statements must be 
submitted with applications for changes to 
a non-retail use where appropriate, with 
reference to (C) above. 
The wider town centre area
F Within a Major or District town centre 
development proposals for main town centre 
uses will be supported where:
a. The use will not result in a harmful 
overconcentration of similar uses, having 
regard to Policy EC17 (Concentration of 
uses); 
b. They provide a positive frontage including 
an active ground floor frontage or if it 
can be suitably demonstrated that this 
is not possible a window display or other 
appropriate positive frontage at the ground 
floor; and
c. They comply with other Local Plan policies.
G Development proposals for residential uses on 
the ground floor level or below, both within 
the PSA and the wider town centre area, are 
inappropriate and will be strongly resisted. 
This includes proposals for the conversion 
of units currently in a main town centre 
or complementary commercial, cultural or 
community use.
260Explanation
8.77 This policy designates the Primary Shopping 
Areas within Lewisham’s Major and District 
Centres, which are shown on the Policies Map. 
PSAs are characterised by their predominantly 
retail role and character and remain a focal point 
for town centre activity, particularly as they 
tend to be in the most accessible parts of the 
centre. The Local Plan seeks to ensure that the 
retail function of these areas is maintained and 
enhanced to support the long-term vitality and 
viability of the town centres.
8.78 The Local Plan provides flexibility for a wide 
range of commercial, leisure, community and 
cultural uses to locate within town centres. It 
is nonetheless important that a critical mass 
of retail uses are maintained within PSAs to 
reinforce their retail role and character as well 
as to ensure people have access to a range of 
consumer goods. Development proposals for 
Class  E(g) retail uses are strongly encouraged to 
locate within these areas and only when suitable 
sites are not available within PSAs should other 
town centre locations be considered in the site 
selection process.
8.79 New planning legislation has resulted in updates 
to the Use Classes Order and the creation of a 
new Class E which brings together a range of 
commercial, business and service uses, including 
retail92. This provides additional flexibility for the 
commercial market by expanding the scope of 
Permitted Development rights, meaning changes 
between Class E uses do not require planning permission. The Council recognises the benefits 
of the new Class E which can help landowners 
and leaseholders to quickly respond to market 
signals and keep business units in viable use. At 
the same time it is seeking to ensure the retail 
function of a PSA is not compromised to the 
extent that it adversely impacts on town centre 
vitality and viability, or the Council’s ability to 
plan positively for identified needs for retail 
floorspace over the plan period.
8.80 Shopping Area Impact Statements are an 
important tool to assess the impact of a 
development proposal on the retail function 
of the PSA. They must be submitted with all 
applications for uses within the PSA that do 
not contribute to its retail function (i.e. uses 
which are not Class E(a) uses). The level of 
detail included within a statement should be 
commensurate with the nature and scale of 
the development proposed. When assessing 
impacts on the PSA consideration will be given 
to the existing mix of uses within the PSA 
to establish whether the development will 
significantly diminish the availability of retail 
uses and people’s access to consumer goods. 
The Council’s latest Authority Monitoring Report 
should be referred for information on the mix 
of uses in the PSA, however applicants may 
need to undertake surveys to ensure decisions 
are informed by up-to-date information. Where 
non-retail uses are introduced in the PSA they 
must be for appropriate main town centre uses, 
be designed with positive frontages and maintain 
a contiguous active ground floor frontage with 
adjoining units. This will help to attract visitors 
and generate footfall which in turn can support 
the viability of existing retail uses and the PSA 
more generally. 92 This includes changes to the Town and Country 
Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) 
Regulations 2020 and amendments to the Town and 
Country Planning (General Permitted Development) 
(England) Order 2015.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TURE8.81 Lewisham Major Centre is the Borough’s principal 
town centre and a key visitor destination. 
Local evidence93 indicates that town centres 
in Lewisham’s ‘central area’ make a significant 
contribution to the Borough’s retail floorspace 
capacity and will play a role in future needs over 
the plan period. Lewisham Shopping Centre 
comprises a large part of the Major Centre’s PSA 
and contains its main concentration of retail uses.  
To support the continued retail function of the 
PSA within the Major Centre, a target threshold 
approach will be used to help manage the mix 
and balance of uses within it, so that retail uses 
form the majority of uses within the PSA. The 
50% target threshold has been informed by our 
latest town centre surveys. It is considered a 
realistic and reasonable indicator for the point 
at which the PSA can retain its principal retail 
function and provide sufficient capacity to 
help meet Lewisham’s future floorspace needs. 
Development proposals that will result in the 
overall percentage of retail uses falling below 
this threshold target will be resisted however, 
flexibility will be applied where it can be suitably 
demonstrated that the viability and vitality of the 
PSA will not be adversely affected.8.82 Breaks in the continuity of shopping frontages 
threaten to diminish the function, character 
or appearance of town centres.  Development 
proposals must therefore be designed with 
positive frontages and maintain a contiguous 
active ground floor frontage with adjoining units, 
avoiding harmful breaks of the frontage, also 
taking into account the prevailing character of 
the streetscape and townscape. Active frontages 
should be associated with the use itself or where 
this is not possible or suitable, through a window 
display or other feature creating visual interest. 
This is necessary to ensure development supports 
town centre vitality and viability, such as by 
introducing a use that encourages linked trips or 
improves townscape and amenity by providing 
active uses at the street level.
8.83 Within town centres development proposals for 
residential uses on ground floor or basement 
levels are not considered appropriate and will 
be resisted. This is owing to the detrimental 
impact the introduction of housing at the street 
level can have on the vitality and viability of the 
town centre, along with the character of the 
townscape. Impacts include the introduction of 
harmful breaks on the continuity of frontages 
and, where conversion is considered, the loss or 
compromising of existing space for commercial 
and related town centre uses.

Trends Report (2021).
262EC15 Local Centres
A Development proposals within and at the 
edge of a Local Centre must demonstrate how 
they will support the vitality and viability of 
the centre and make a positive contribution 
to its local character, with reference to Policy 
EC11 (Town centres at the heart of our 
communities).
B Development proposals incorporating small 
and moderately sized units for retail use are 
encouraged to locate in Local Centres. Where 
such provision already exists, this should be 
protected wherever possible in order to ensure 
a balanced mix of main town centre uses.
C Major development proposals within a Local 
Centre must make provision for a reasonable 
amount of small or moderately sized units 
suitable for micro, small and independent 
businesses. Where an end-user has been 
secured for immediate occupation on the 
development’s completion and requires a 
larger unit or floor plate, this should be flexibly 
designed to enable sub-division into smaller 
units in the future.
D Development proposals involving the change 
of use from Class E to other main town 
centre uses within Local Centres will only be 
supported where it is demonstrated that:
a. The replacement use is an appropriate 
main town centre, community, cultural or 
employment generating use; and
b. An active frontage is provided at the 
ground floor level or if it can be suitably 
demonstrated that this is not possible a 
window display or other positive frontage.E Development proposals for the change of a 
main town centre use to a residential use at 
the ground floor level or below will only be 
permitted where:
a. It is demonstrated through a robust and 
recent marketing exercise of a minimum 
continuous period of two-years at a 
reasonable local market value for rent 
or sale, that the unit has been vacant 
during this time and there is no reasonable 
prospect of retaining it in an appropriate 
main town centre, community or 
employment generating use; and
b. There will be no adverse impact on local 
area character and the continuity of the 
shopping frontage in the Local Centre.
F Planning conditions may be used to secure 
Class E(a) uses that contribute to the retail 
function of the Local Centre. Where retail 
development is conditioned for that use, 
development proposals seeking a change to 
another appropriate main town centre use, 
including full flexibility for Class E commercial, 
business and service uses, must demonstrate 
that there is no reasonable prospect of the 
unit being used for continued retail use. This 
must be evidenced by a robust and recent 
marketing exercise covering a minimum 
continuous period of 6-months at a reasonable 
market value for rent or sale to the local area.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.84 Local Centres complement Lewisham’s larger 
Major and District Centres. They play an 
important role in providing a range of shops 
and services that meet the day-to-day needs of 
residents and others within the Borough. They 
also feature at least one community facility that 
provides a focal point for community activity and 
helps to attract visitors. Local centres  support 
sustainable neighbourhoods by enabling people 
to walk or cycle to access goods, services and 
facilities. They can be particularly beneficial to 
those with reduced mobility, including older 
people, who may be not be able to visit larger 
town centres on a regular basis.
8.85 Development proposals for retail uses consisting 
of smaller and moderately sized units and 
floor-plates are encouraged to locate in Local 
Centres. Where such provision already exists, this 
should be protected wherever possible in order 
to ensure a balanced mix of main town centre 
uses and to support the role and function of the 
centre.  However it is recognised that the new 
Class E category provides greater flexibility for 
changes from retail to other commercial, business 
and service uses. Where planning permission is 
required, development proposals for the change 
of use from Class E must be for appropriate main 
town centre or employment generating uses.
8.86 Local Centres are smaller in scale than Major and 
District Centres and therefore provide unique 
opportunities for accommodating micro, small 
and independent businesses. Major development 
proposals must, and all other developments 
should seek to, integrate a reasonable amount 
of small units or space suitable for these types of businesses. This can include dedicated units or 
flexibly specified space that can be easily sub-
divided. What constitutes a reasonable amount 
will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
8.87 In order to support the role and function of 
Local Centres the Council may use planning 
conditions to secure retail uses where new 
development comes forward. Local Centres vary 
in terms of their size and catchment, provision 
of shops and services, and local character. The 
need for or loss of retail uses will therefore affect 
centres differently, for example, losses may be 
felt more acutely in smaller centres. The Council 
will therefore consider the need for conditions 
on a case-by-case basis. Where retail uses have 
been conditioned and a change of use is sought, 
applicants must demonstrate that reasonable 
efforts have been made to retain the unit in retail 
use in the first instance.
8.88 Positive street frontages and active ground floor 
frontages are vital to the vibrancy and character 
of Local Centres. Development proposals must 
make a positive contribution to the townscape 
and create a coherent relationship with the 
street. Development proposals, including 
changes of use, must maintain the continuity 
of frontages in the centre and not result in 
a harmful fragmentation of the frontage, 
whether individually or cumulatively with 
other developments. Development proposals 
must provide an active ground floor frontage, 
preferably associated with the use itself and 
where this is not possible through a window 
display or other feature creating visual interest.
2648.89 Development proposals for the conversion of 
a main town centre use at the ground floor 
level or below to a residential use will be 
strongly resisted. This is in order to protect the 
function of Local Centres and the character of 
their townscape. Only where it can be suitably 
demonstrated through arobust and recent 
marketing exercise that there is no continued 
demand for the existing or an appropriate 
main town centre use will such proposals be 
considered. Viability will then be considered 
in combination with impact on the continuity 
of frontages and local character. Development 
that results in a harmful break in the frontage 
will not be supported. This will be considered 
on a case by case basis, but generally refers to 
the introduction of a use that detracts from the 
continuity of a publicly accessible and active 
frontage, and is incoherent with the prevailing 
streetscape and townscape.

within the local area  which can be reached 
safely, easily and conveniently by walking, 
normally within 400-800 metres; and 
b. An active frontage is provided at the 
ground floor level, or if it can be suitably 
demonstrated this is not possible a window

a. It is demonstrated through a robust and 
recent marketing exercise of a minimum 
continuous period of one-year at a 
reasonable local market value for rent

during this time and there is no reasonable 
prospect of retaining the unit in an 
appropriate main town centre, community 
or employment generating use; and
b. There will be no adverse impact on local 
area character and the continuity of the 
frontages within the shopping parade or 
other frontages.
D Where a development proposal involving a 
main town centre use is located outside of a 
Major, District or Local Centre and satisfies the 
Sequential Test, the Council may use planning 
conditions to secure an element of Class E(g) 
retail uses. This in order to ensure provision 
of essential daily consumer goods in the area 
where there is an identified need. 
267
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.90 There are a number of shops and services 
located outside of the designated town and local 
centres,  which are dispersed across the Borough 
in shopping parades, at corner shops and other 
locations. These help cater to the essential day-to-
day needs of residents, workers and visitors. These 
types of uses are distinguished from those located 
in out-of-centre retail parks and large format retail 
warehouses, which are dealt with elsewhere in the 
Local Plan.
8.91 It is important that people in the Borough have 
easy access to essential day-to-day consumer 
goods. Development proposals should therefore 
seek to retain shops outside of centres wherever 
possible. However it is recognised that the new 
Class E category provides greater flexibility for 
changes from retail to other commercial, business 
and service uses. Where planning permission is 
required, development proposals for the change of 
use from Class E to other appropriate main town 
centre or employment generating uses will only 
be permitted where it is demonstrated that there 
is similar alternative provision available locally, 
normally within 5 to 10 minutes walking distance 
(roughly 400-800 metres). In terms of alternative 
provision, some flexibility may be applied where 
the use in question provides a bespoke offer which 
is not necessarily an essential good or service, such 
as a wine merchant or chocolatier. Development 
proposals for alternative employment generating 
or community uses that are compatible with the 
local area will be supported in order to secure the 
viability of existing units and buildings. 
8.92 Out-of-centre shops and facilities are facing 
significant pressure for change of use, particularly 
to housing, given the improving residential land values in the Borough. However the introduction 
of residential uses within shopping parades and 
other local service destinations can compromise 
their functional integrity, viability and townscape 
value. We will therefore seek to ensure that all 
reasonable efforts have been made to actively 
market units for other employment generating or 
community uses, before giving consideration to 
residential uses. In this instance, marketing should 
cover a minimum continuous period of one-year at 
a reasonable local market rate for rent or sale.
8.93 All changes of use must maintain the continuity 
of frontages in the shopping parade or other 
frontages. Development proposals must not result 
in a harmful fragmentation of shopping frontages, 
either individually or by their cumulative impact. 
Additionally, development proposals must make a 
positive contribution to local character, consistent 
with other Local Plan policies. Ground floor 
residential development, in particular, has the 
potential to interrupt the established rhythm of the 
streetscape and townscape in shopping parades.
8.94 In order to ensure that people in Lewisham have 
easy access to essential day-to-day consumer 
goods, the Council may use planning conditions 
to secure new retail uses for development located 
in in areas where there is an identified need for 
this provision. Local need will be assessed on a 
case-by-case basis having regard to the availability 
of retail uses within 400 to 800 metres radius of 
the proposed development site, which is roughly 
equivalent to 5 to 10 minutes walking distance. 
Development proposals are strongly encouraged to 
consider the need for provision of essential goods, 
particularly in areas which do not benefit from 
good levels of public transport access.
268EC17 Concentration of uses
A Development proposals must not result in a 
harmful overconcentration of the following Sui 
Generis uses:
a. Hot food takeaways;
b. Betting offices, casinos and bingo halls;
c. Payday loan shops
d. Pawnbrokers;
e. Nightclubs and dance halls; and
f. Drinking establishments.
B  The harmful overconcentration of uses will 
be assessed on the basis of the number of 
similar uses within a 400 metre radius of the 
development and where:
a. The vitality and viability of the town centre 
will be adversely impacted, taking into 
account the function of the centre in the 
hierarchy; and
b. The character of the area has changed or 
local amenity has been adversely impacted 
as a result of:
i. Increased noise, odour, fumes and other 
nuisances;
ii. Traffic generation including from taxis, 
private hire and servicing vehicles;
iii. Inadequate provision of waste 
management and recycling facilities;
iv. Anti-social behaviour and public safety. 
C Development proposals for uses listed in (A) 
must submit sufficient information to allow for 
an assessment of the concentration of uses, in 
line with the criteria in (B) above.Hot food takeaways
D In addition to complying with (A) and (B) 
above, development proposals for hot food 
takeaways will only be permitted where:
a. They are located at least 400 metres 
away from the boundary of an existing or 
proposed primary or secondary school; and 
b. The proportion of hot food takeaway 
premises in the shopping frontage complies 
with the thresholds set out in Table 8.3 .
Food and drink services
E Development proposals for uses involving the 
service of food and drink must make adequate 
arrangements to protect and manage local 
amenity, in line with Policy QD7 (Amenity and 
agent of change).
F Where development proposals for uses 
involving the service of food and drink are 
acceptable in principle, a condition will be 
sought requiring the operator to achieve and 
operate in compliance with the Healthier 
Catering Commitment Standard.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TURETable 8.5: Shopping frontage thresholds for takeaways 
270Explanation
8.95 Town centres are at the heart of Lewisham’s 
neighbourhoods and communities. Their vitality 
and viability relies heavily on the presence of a 
mix of uses and activities. It is important that 
development proposals do not result in a harmful 
concentration of uses. This is especially for 
certain Sui Generis Uses, whose proliferation can 
also adversely impact on local character, amenity, 
public health and safety.
8.96 In assessing whether development proposals 
will lead to a harmful over-concentration of 
uses, we will use the policy criteria above. A 
400 metre radius, established as a straight line 
distance from the proposed development site, 
is considered an appropriate range from which 
to assess impacts. This measure is generally 
accepted as 5-minutes walking distance and 
provides a useful benchmark against which other 
similar provision could be easily accessed in 
the locality. Development proposals must have 
particular regard to areas experiencing significant 
deprivation94, where the impacts of some uses 
may be more pronounced.
8.97 Hot food takeaways are now recognised as 
an ongoing concern with respect to the wider 
systems approach to health and well-being. This 
policy helps give effect to the London Plan Policy 
E9 (Retail, markets and hot food takeaways), 
which encourages Boroughs to manage the 
concentration of such Sui Generis uses, both 
around schools and within town centres.8.98 Food and drink establishments regularly attract 
a high number of visitors and by virtue of their 
operation may give rise to environmental and 
amenity issues. Development proposals must 
make adequate arrangements for operational 
requirements whilst ensuring protection of 
amenity. This includes consideration of litter, 
commercial waste disposal, fumes, noise, traffic 
and parking. Planning conditions may be used to 
ensure there are no adverse impacts on local area 
amenity.
8.99 The Healthier Catering Commitment is a scheme 
that helps food businesses in London to provide 
healthier food to their customers. Hot food 
takeaways are often associated with unhealthy 
food, however it is accepted that other uses 
supporting the food and beverage industry also 
make provision for items that are high in calories, 
fat, salt and sugar and which could adversely 
impact on health outcomes. This includes  Class 
E business uses such as cafes, restaurants and 
coffee shops. To make it easier to access healthy 
food options in Lewisham, we will seek that 
operators achieve compliance with the Healthier 
Catering Commitment Scheme.
94 For policy implementation this should be taken as an 
indicative benchmark of the 20 per cent most deprived 
areas, in accordance with the Government’s latest Indices 
of Multiple Deprivation (IMD).

A The cultural and creative industries (including 
education and training facilities that support 
and are associated with these industries) 
contribute to the diversity and distinctiveness 
of Lewisham’s neighbourhoods and play 
an important role in the local economy. 
Development proposals should support the 
continued growth and development of these 
industries by:
a. Protecting existing cultural venues and uses, 
including by applying the Agent of Change 
principle;
b. Making provision for new cultural venues, 
workspace and performance space in town 
centres and other appropriate locations, 
particularly in major development proposals 
and large-scale regeneration schemes;
c. Designing public realm with spaces that can 
be adapted to support civic and cultural 
events, including outdoors; 
d. Considering the use of vacant properties and 
land for temporary pop-up or meanwhile uses 
for cultural and creative activities, having 
regard to Policy DM5 (Meanwhile uses); and
e. Enabling the provision of high quality, fast 
and reliable digital infrastructure, in line with 
Policy TR7 (Digital connectivity).B Development proposals involving the loss of 
cultural venues that have heritage, economic, 
social or cultural value should be avoided. They 
will only be permitted where:
a. The loss of the venue will not result in a 
significant adverse impact on the role and 
function of a Cultural Quarter or town 
centre;
b. There is authoritative marketing evidence 
which demonstrates that there is no 
reasonable prospect of the building or 
space being used for a similar or alternative 
cultural use, covering a minimum 
continuous period of two-years. This must 
include evidence of efforts made to market 
the venue to the local community, relevant 
cultural organisations and business groups; 
c. The use is not a meanwhile use; and
d. Where the proposal involves the demolition 
or loss of a building it complies with other 
Local Plan policies including on heritage 
assets and the historic environment.
C Where a cultural venue is a public house, 
or comprises space within a public house, 
development proposals involving the loss of 
a venue will be assessed in accordance with 
Policy EC18 (Public houses). 
D The Lewisham North Creative Enterprise 
Zone (CEZ) is designated in the Local Plan. 
Development proposals should support and 
contribute to enhancing the cultural and 
creative industries within the CEZ, in line 
with Policy LNA3 (Lewisham North Creative 
Enterprise Zone).

a. Deptford Creekside;
b. New Cross; and
c. Forest Hill.
F Cultural, community and commercial uses 
will be encouraged and supported within 
Cultural Quarters, having regard to other Local

retain or make appropriate re-provision to 
accommodate existing cultural, community 
and commercial uses where these make a 
positive contribution to a Cultural Quarter. 
Development proposals that will adversely 
impact on the distinctive character and 
function of a Cultural Quarter, including 
through the loss of viable cultural venues, will 
be refused.
G Temporary activities and meanwhile uses (such 
as festivals, markets, exhibitions, performances 
and other cultural events) will be supported 
within Cultural Quarters, with reference to 
Policy DM5 (Meanwhile Uses).Evening and night-time economy
H Evening and night-time economic activities 
should make a positive contribution to the 
neighbourhoods within which they are located 
by:
a. Supporting the local economy through 
provision of a wide range of employment 
generating uses and jobs along with 
opportunities to carry out business beyond 
normal daytime hours;
b. Enhancing the vitality and viability of town 
centres and other employment areas; and
c. Reinforcing local character and identity, 
and creating more inclusive communities, 
through provision of a locally distinctive 
and expanded leisure, cultural and 
entertainment offer.
I Development proposals for evening and night-
time economic activities should be directed 
to appropriate town centre locations, giving 
priority to the following designated areas of 
night-time activity:
a. Areas with more than local significance:
i. Major centres of Catford and Lewisham;
ii. District centres of Blackheath, Deptford, 
and New Cross Gate; and
iii. Local centre of New Cross Road.
b. Areas with local significance:
i. District centres of Deptford and Forest 
Hill.
274J Development proposals for evening and night-
time economic activities located outside of 
town centres will only be supported where 
the use(s) will complement and not adversely 
impact on the town centre network and

K Development proposals for evening and night-
time economic activities must demonstrate that 
they:
a. Will protect, manage and not result in 
an unreasonable adverse impact on local 
amenity ;
b. Will not result in a harmful 
overconcentration of uses, with reference to 
Policy EC17 (Concentration of uses);

Cultural Quarters
8.101 Lewisham benefits from the presence of its 
distinctive Cultural Quarters. These are local 
concentrations of complementary cultural, 
community and commercial activities and feature 
a key community anchor, such as an education or 
cultural institution. Cultural Quarters reflect the 
unique character and diversity of the Borough, 
along with performing important economic, 
cultural and social functions. This policy seeks to 
reinforce and enhance the character and mix of 
uses within these locations. Additional policies 
for Cultural Quarters are set out in Part 3 of the 
Local Plan.
Evening and night-time economy
8.102 The night-time economy refers to economic 
activity taking place between the hours of 6pm 
and 6am. Night-time economic activities cover a 
broad range of uses but typically concern leisure, 
cultural and entertainment venues associated 
with the Use Class E (Commercial, business and 
service) and Sui Generis uses (such as night 
clubs, drinking establishments, public houses, 
cinemas, theatres and performance venues). The 
London Plan considers the night-time economy 
a strategic priority and seeks to promote the 
Capital as a 24-hour global city in order to 
maximise opportunities for economic and cultural 
development. Lewisham is well placed to play a 
key role in this regard, with vibrant and diverse 
neighbourhoods and town centres that can both 
anchor and benefit from night-time activities.8.103 The London Plan identifies several categories of 
night-time economy clusters across the Capital. 
Lewisham contains several Major and District 
Centres that exert “more than local significance” 
in this function, including Lewisham, Catford, 
Blackheath and New Cross. The Local Plan also 
designates Deptford and Forest Hill District 
Centres as areas with “local significance”. For the 
most part these centres are located in Lewisham’s 
Creative Enterprise Zone where night-time 
activities will help to support and strengthen the 
Borough’s economy and cultural offer.
8.104 Consistent with other Local Plan policies that 
support the town centre hierarchy, night-time 
activities should be directed to the above noted 
strategically important locations. Proposals 
in other town centres will be considered 
having regard to the nature and scale of the 
development in relation to role and function of 
the centre. Whilst we are broadly supportive of 
appropriately located night-time activities, we 
will seek to ensure that proposals do not result in 
excessive concentrations of uses that adversely 
impact on town centre viability and local amenity.
8.105 Development proposals for night-time economic 
activities at out-of-centre locations should be 
avoided. They should only be considered when 
it is demonstrated through the Sequential 
Approach that no suitable town centre sites are 
available, or the use would be more appropriately 
located in a designated employment area. This 
will help to avoid situations where out-of-centre 
clusters of activity develop cumulatively over 
time as these can undermine the viability and 
vitality of town centres. This policy provides 
276flexibility for out-of-centre locations recognising 
these may be preferable in certain circumstances, 
such as where there are site constraints or 
to better manage particular impacts on local 
amenity. Temporary consents may be used in 
order to monitor and review impacts over time.
8.106  Development proposals for night-time economic 
activities must be located in well-connected 
areas. This includes options for night-time 
public transport such as the Night Bus or 
Overground Night Service – the designated 
night-time clusters are already serviced this 
way. Development proposals should incorporate 
public realm enhancements, including external 
lighting, wherever possible in order to create a 
more attractive and legible environment. These 
measures will help to ensure that all visitors and 
workers can easily and safely access venues and 
facilities.

A Public houses are unique and integral 
features of Lewisham’s neighbourhoods and 
cultural identity, and perform important 
community, social and economic functions 
locally. There will be a presumption in 
favour of the retention of public houses in 
Lewisham. Development proposals involving 
the loss of a public house that has heritage, 
economic, social or cultural value to the 
community, including through change of 
use or redevelopment, will be refused unless 
there is robust and authoritative evidence to 
demonstrate that:
a. Legitimate efforts have been made 
to preserve the facility as a public 
house, including through evidence of 
regular maintenance and upkeep, good 
management and through business 
diversification;
b. The public house is not financially viable 
and there is no reasonable prospect of 
the premises remaining in this use, or 
an alternative community use, in the 
foreseeable future as evidenced through 
attempts at different business models and 
management, and an active marketing 
exercise of a minimum continuous period of 
three-years; and
c. All feasible options for the re-provision 
of the public house have been fully 
investigated, and where these are not 
considered deliverable sufficient justification 
is provided.
B Development proposals affecting a public 
house, including its operational and ancillary 
amenity space, will be refused unless there 
is robust and authoritative evidence to demonstrate that the viability of the pub, 
and its current and future operation, will not 
be compromised and development will not 
detract from the character and appearance of 
the building, including any features of historic 
or cultural significance.
C Development proposals involving the 
replacement or re-provision of a public house 
must ensure the replacement facility is of a 
high quality design and responds positively 
to local character, taking into account the 
need to preserve or enhance the significance 
of heritage assets and their setting. The 
development proposal must provide an 
appropriate amount and configuration of 
floorspace to enable the continued viability of 
the public house, and should not result in a 
net reduction of floorspace unless this can be 
sufficiently justified. This includes dedicated 
performance space or amenity space that has 
been or can reasonably be used for cultural or 
community uses.
D Where the change of use of a public house 
is considered acceptable by the Council, 
development proposals must retain the 
building and other associated features 
where these makes a positive contribution 
to local character, including by their historic, 
streetscape and townscape value.
E Development proposals for new public houses 
will be supported where they contribute to 
liveable neighbourhoods by improving people’s 
access to these community facilities and 
comply with other Local Plan policies.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.107 Public houses, or pubs, are a unique and 
integral feature of the British cultural identity of 
Lewisham. They are fundamentally community 
facilities that promote social cohesion, offering 
a welcoming environment for people of all 
backgrounds to socialise and interact. Many 
local pubs are heritage assets in their own 
right, or have played a part in the Borough’s 
cultural and historical development. This may be 
reflected in their built form or through a pub’s 
association with people or events that have 
shaped the Borough’s history. Pubs often have 
longstanding ties to their neighbourhoods and 
strong affiliations with local communities and 
community groups, and therefore contribute to 
people’s sense of place and belonging.
8.108 There are many different community functions 
that pubs can perform. For example, pubs often 
include amenity space which is used as venues 
for functions, performance space, and informal 
meeting space for residents and community 
groups. Pubs also support the local economy 
and are particularly vital to the visitor, evening 
and night-time economy. Lewisham, like many 
other London Boroughs, has experienced a 
decline in public houses over time. Recognising 
the important social and economic role they 
play, we will seek to guard against the loss of 
these community and cultural facilities. Particular 
consideration will be given to the need to protect 
purpose built, historic pubs (built in the 20th 
Century or earlier), especially where these are 
landmark features in the townscape or sited 
at prominent positions, within town and local 
centres or elsewhere in the Borough.8.109 Development proposals involving the demolition 
or loss of an existing public house, including 
through change of use, must submit evidence 
to demonstrate that the pub is not financially 
viable and there is no reasonable prospect of the 
premises remaining in this use, or an alternative 
community use. Applications must provide full 
details of patronage levels and trading accounts 
over the past 3 years, including accounts from 
previous management where appropriate. In 
addition, applications must provide a statement 
documenting the steps taken by the owner 
or operator to respond to viability concerns, 
including falling patronage levels and profit 
margins. This might cover considerations given to 
business diversification (for example, expanding 
the food and beverage offer), promotions or 
building refurbishment. Finally, proposals will 
need to provide proof of a marketing exercise 
covering a minimum continuous period of 
three-years, including details of commercial 
agents, advertisements and lease terms offered. 
During this time the pub must be actively 
marketing at a reasonable local market rent. 
We will consider whether any ties or restrictive 
covenants have affected interest. Development 
proposals will be refused where there is good 
reason to believe that the viability of the pub 
has been compromised by deliberate neglect or 
mismanagement.
2808.110 Public houses require dedicated operational 
spaces. They also often feature function rooms 
or ancillary amenity space, including outdoor 
gardens, which are critical to supporting their role 
as community facilities and places of gathering.  
Where development proposals involve a 
reduction or reconfiguration of such operational 
and ancillary spaces, it must be demonstrated 
that this will not have a detrimental impact 
on the financial viability of the public house. 
Furthermore, proposals must show that the 
remaining residual space will be of a sufficient 
amount and quality to continue to meet the 
needs of pub users. Operational and ancillary 
spaces include, but are not limited to, beer 
gardens, function rooms, kitchens, cellars and 
accommodation integrated into the building. 
8.111 Where sites are proposed to be redeveloped, 
including through comprehensive redevelopment, 
our priority is to protect pubs particularly where 
they are of historic, cultural or community 
interest. However, in certain circumstances it may 
be acceptable that a facility is replaced or re-
provided. Development proposals will be required 
to demonstrate that they have considered all 
reasonable options for retaining the pub in situ. 
Where this is not possible, the replacement 
provision must be designed to a sufficient quality 
and standard to ensure the continued viability of 
the pub. This aim of this policy is to ensure there 
is a genuine intention to retain the facility in 
viable use, so to prevent against future changes 
to alternative uses.8.112 National planning policy recognises the value 
of public houses as community facilities. We 
will therefore seek to protect against their loss, 
having regard also to Policy CI 1 (Safeguarding 
and securing community infrastructure). Where 
the loss of a pub is proposed, development 
proposals must suitably demonstrate that there is 
similar alternative provision elsewhere in the local 
area. If there is sufficient evidence to support 
that the loss is acceptable in principle, proposals 
must retain the building and any ancillary land 
or other features, where these makes a positive 
contribution to local character.
8.113 Development proposals involving the loss of 
public houses listed as Assets of Community 
Value will be assessed against this and other 
relevant Local Plan policies.
8.114 To support the implementation of this policy the 
Local Plan sets out marketing requirements for 
development proposals affecting public houses 
(Appendix 5) which all proposals will be assessed 
against, as appropriate.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TURE282Opposite: Deptford MarketEC20 Markets
A Development proposals must protect and 
seek to enhance existing markets and market 
spaces. New markets or market spaces will 
be encouraged and supported where they 
complement Lewisham’s town centre network 
and hierarchy, and will make a positive 
contribution to the culture and vibrancy of the 
Borough.
B Development proposals for new markets 
or market space should be directed to 
appropriate town centre locations. Where new 
market space is proposed outside of centres, 
and where the Local Plan has not made 
provision for main town centre uses there (for 
example, through site allocation policies), 
proposals will only be supported where it 
is demonstrated through the sequential 
approach that they:
a. Will not adversely impact on the vitality and 
viability of the town centre network and 
hierarchy;
b. Make beneficial use of vacant or underused 
sites;
c. Are located in well-connected areas with 
good Public Transport Access Levels; 
d. Can be appropriately accommodated on 
streets or other areas of the public realm, 
where appropriate; and
e. Are temporary in nature.C Development proposals that are likely to affect 
existing markets within town centres will be 
considered having regard to:
a. The priority given to retaining markets as 
part of the town centre offer and ensuring 
appropriate re-provision of market space, 
where there is a demonstrable demand; and
b. The impact on town centre vitality and 
viability with particular consideration given 
to: 
i. Provision of a range of premises and 
floorspace to support small and start-up 
businesses;
ii. Local character, including distinctive 
character of the market; and
iii. Public realm and townscape.
D Development proposals for markets and 
market space must demonstrate that there 
will not be an unreasonable adverse impact 
on local amenity, and not have a detrimental 
impact on public health and safety and the 
public realm.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.115 Lewisham is well served by local markets 
(including street markets, specialist and farmers’ 
markets) that complement and support the 
vitality and viability of the Borough’s town 
centres. These markets play a vital economic 
role by extending consumer choice and access 
to a wide range of goods and services as well 
as supporting employment, including through 
provision of local jobs and operating space for 
start-up, small and independent businesses. 
Markets also have an important social and 
cultural function. They serve as hubs for 
community activity and help to reinforce local 
identity and character. Some of Lewisham’s 
markets, such as Douglas Way market in 
Deptford, have strong historical connections and 
are renowned for their unique offer, attracting 
visitors both from the local area and further 
afield.
8.116 For the purpose of this policy markets are 
defined as land and/or space that is authorised 
or licenced for market use, taking into account 
market space secured on temporary basis 
(i.e. as a meanwhile use).  Markets may also 
include public realm that has been designed to 
accommodate market space but which is not 
currently authorised or licenced for this use. For 
example, outdoor public realm in town centres 
designed with connection-ready infrastructure, 
such as power outlets and water supply. The 
presence of a market or market space will 
be established on a case-by-case basis with 
reference to planning, licencing and Business 
Rate records.8.117 Development proposals for new markets and 
market space will be expected to apply the ‘town 
centre first’ principle of site selection. Markets 
should complement and support the vitality and 
viability of the Borough’s town centre network 
and not compete with existing centres for trade. 
However it is recognised that site availability 
and other constraints may prohibit additional 
provision from coming forward in town centres. 
Further, there may be vacant or underutilised 
sites (such as those with planning consent but 
where development has not yet commenced) 
which offer interim opportunities for optimising 
the use of land in the Borough. We will therefore 
give consideration to out-of-centre proposals 
where it can be demonstrated the town centre 
hierarchy will not be compromised. Applications 
should detail how the goods and services 
provided will not undermine the offer in existing 
centres.. Markets should not normally be located 
in poorly connected areas. Given the high levels 
of footfall markets attract it is important that 
visitors can easily and safely access them during 
their operating hours. Temporary consents or 
planning conditions may be used in order to 
ensure flexibility for assessment of impacts over 
time.
2848.118 Where new development concerns or may impact 
on existing markets, proposals must demonstrate 
how they will safeguard market space including 
appropriate re-provision. Where market space 
is to be reconfigured or reduced proposals will 
be expected to show that sufficient provision 
will remain to meet local needs for employment 
floorspace, particularly for small and start-up 
businesses. Development offers the opportunity 
to improve the functional and aesthetic quality 
of town centres and the market spaces within 
them. All proposals should seek to maintain and 
enhance the unique features of the market and 
its associated public realm where these make a 
positive contribution to local character. This is 
particularly important given the historical and 
cultural value of many of Lewisham’s markets.
8.119 Development proposals must make adequate 
arrangements to avoid or mitigate unreasonable 
impacts on local amenity. This includes 
consideration of congestion on footpaths 
and the road network, refuse storage and 
collection, noise and odour. Proposals for street 
markets must demonstrate that there will be no 
detrimental effect on the functioning of the road 
network.

8 ECONOMY AND CUL TUREExplanation
8.120 The visitor economy is an integral part of the 
local and wider regional economy. It provides 
residents with job opportunities, supports local 
businesses and helps to ensure the viability 
of cultural and leisure facilities. Lewisham 
boasts an array of leisure, cultural and historic 
attractions. The Borough is also within easy 
travelling distance of London’s Central Activities 
Zone, making it a convenient base for visitors to 
explore the Capital. The London Plan estimates 
that an additional 58,000 bedrooms of serviced 
accommodation will be needed in London by 
2041 and Lewisham has a role to play in meeting 
this demand.
8.121 For the purpose of this policy, serviced visitor 
accommodation pertains to uses within the C1 
Use Class including hotels, bed and breakfasts, 
traveller / youth hostels, short-term holiday lets 
and serviced self-catering apartments.
8.122 Serviced visitor accommodation is defined by 
the NPPF as a main town centre use. It should 
therefore be located within or at the edge of 
town centres95. These locations are well-suited to 
supporting visitors with a range of facilities and 
services, and generally benefit from good public 
transport links. Development proposals outside 
of town centres will need to be sufficiently 
justified, having regard to the sequential 
approach for main town centre uses.8.123 Development proposals for visitor 
accommodation must contribute positively 
to the local area, including its character. The 
nature and scale of the development should be 
proportionate to its surroundings. For instance, 
a large format hotel may be more appropriate at 
a prominent town centre location or transport 
interchange, whereas a smaller scale boutique 
hotel or serviced apartment may be more 
sensitively integrated elsewhere in the Borough.
8.124 Development proposals must ensure adequately 
sized amenity spaces and bedrooms, including 
sufficient provision for accessible bedrooms with 
reference to London Plan Policy E10 (Visitor 
Infrastructure). New development should 
be capable of achieving accreditation by the 
National Quality Assurance Scheme.
8.125 Development proposals must be designed with 
positive frontages. They should also maximise 
opportunities to integrate active ground floor 
frontages and appropriate ancillary uses, 
particularly to support town centre vitality and 
viability. Ancillary uses may include cafés and 
restaurants, conference facilities, salons, fitness 
studios and other uses. Access to facilities 
should not be unreasonably restricted and made 
available for use by the wider public.
95 This is in line with the Sequential Approach to the 
location of main town centres uses established by the 
NPPF and London Plan (2021) Policy SD7 Town centres: 
development principles and Development Plan Documents.
2888.126 Development proposals must demonstrate that 
the visitor accommodation is both sustainable 
and feasible. Through the Green Tourism for 
London programme, hotels and other serviced 
accommodation should seek to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions, water use and waste 
generation. Applications must demonstrate that 
an operator will be identified and secured prior 
to the commencement of the development. 
This is necessary to guard against speculative 
hotel development for which there is no clearly 
established business demand, and which might 
preclude the use of land for more beneficial uses 
that support the delivery of the spatial strategy.
8.127 Lewisham has significant housing needs and 
development proposals involving the net loss of 
housing will therefore be refused. In recent years 
the visitor economy has been bolstered by the 
growth in short-term serviced accommodation, 
often offering a more unique and affordable 
alternative to serviced accommodation. It is 
important that the Borough’s housing supply is 
not compromised by unlawful use of residential 
premises for visitor accommodation. The 
Deregulation Act 2015 includes provisions on 
the use of residential properties for temporary 
sleeping accommodation (i.e. serviced lets or 
holiday lets).  Operating an entire residential 
property for short-term rental for more than 90 
nights in London without planning permission is 
an unauthorised change of use.

A The Council will work in partnership with 
stakeholders and its delivery partners to identify  
needs for community infrastructure over the 
plan period, and to secure the timely delivery 
of high quality infrastructure and services to 
meet these needs. Local needs for community 
infrastructure in the Borough will be considered 
taking into account the Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan along with the relevant corporate plans 
and strategies of the Council and other key 
stakeholders, including for: health and social 
care; education and childcare; youth and family 
services; play, sport and recreation;; libraries and 
local history services; and burial space.
B Major development proposals will be expected 
to, and all other development proposals 
should, plan positively to meet local needs 
for community infrastructure. Where a site 
allocation policy sets out requirements for 
community infrastructure, development 
proposals will be required to demonstrate 
how the delivery of this infrastructure will be 
secured through the masterplan process, with 
reference to Policy DM3 (Masterplans and 
comprehensive redevelopment). Elsewhere, 
development proposals must demonstrate 
how any additional demands for community 
infrastructure generated by the development 
will be appropriately addressed, particularly 
in those areas where there is an identified 
need for additional provision, as set out in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Consideration 
should be given to the delivery of new or 
enhanced infrastructure on-site or, where 
appropriate, off-site contributions which support 
the expansion of capacity of existing facilities or 
improvements to them.C Development proposals will be supported 
where they safeguard and enhance community 
infrastructure. Development proposals that 
will result in the loss of an existing community 
facility, or land and buildings formerly in 
community use,  will only be permitted where 
it is suitably demonstrated that:
a. There is no current or future need 
for the existing use or an alternative 
community use and there is adequate 
alternative provision elsewhere to meet 
the needs of the neighbourhood and 
wider community, taking into account the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Applications 
must be supported by evidence of an active 
marketing campaign for community uses 
covering a minimum continuous period of 
twelve-months at a reasonable local market 
value for rent or sale; or
b. There are realistic proposals for replacement 
provision of an equivalent or improved 
standard that will continue to meet the 
needs of the neighbourhood and wider 
community,,; or
c. The development is directly associated 
with a public service transformation 
programme and necessary to enable or 
sustain the delivery of service improvements 
and related investment in community 
infrastructure.

to demonstrate that the existing or an 
appropriate alternative community use is not 
viable.
E Policies CI1.C and CI1.D do not apply to 
development proposals involving the loss of 
sports and recreational facilities, which will be 
assessed against Policy CI3 (Sports, recreation 
and play).
294Explanation
9.1 Community infrastructure is also commonly 
referred to as social infrastructure. It covers 
a range of services and facilities that 
contribute towards inclusive and sustainable 
neighbourhoods and communities by providing 
residents and visitors with opportunities to enjoy 
a good quality of life. Community infrastructure 
includes provision for health services, education 
and training, community facilities (including 
public houses), places of faith, and sport and 
recreation facilities for people of all ages and 
abilities. Green infrastructure is also a component 
of social infrastructure, although it is addressed 
separately in this Local Plan.
9.2 Community infrastructure is essential to 
supporting inclusive neighbourhoods and 
communities along with enabling healthy 
lifestyles, providing vulnerable people with 
support and care, and giving children and 
young people the best start in life. We will 
therefore ensure that community infrastructure 
is safeguarded where there is an identified need 
for it, taking into account Lewisham’s growing 
population and the different requirements of the 
groups within it. At the same time, it is important 
that opportunities are taken to improve or 
replace existing infrastructure in order to ensure 
that facilities within the Borough are maintained 
at a good modern standard. The Council has 
prepared an Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) 
through consultation with service providers and 
delivery partners. It sets out the infrastructure 
required to support Lewisham’s neighbourhoods 
over the long-term, including community 
infrastructure. The IDP will be regularly reviewed 
and updated over the plan period to ensure it 
reflects the latest available information on needs, 
project delivery and funding.9.3 Where replacement community infrastructure is 
proposed applications must include a statement 
explaining how the new provision will result in 
demonstrable improvements, both in terms of 
design quality and functionality of use. This 
should include an assessment of the existing 
facility giving consideration to factors such as 
building condition, flexibility of use, amenities, 
safety, accessibility and current usage. If the 
replacement provision is proposed at a different 
site, applications should clearly set out the 
reasons why this is necessary and how local area 
needs will continue to be met. We will seek that 
new provision does not result in a net loss of 
floorspace for community use. However some 
flexibility may be applied where it can be shown 
that a reduction will not compromise the delivery 
of services or provision of facilities.Grow Mayo Community Garden

9 COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE9.4 Development proposals involving the loss or 
transfer of community infrastructure within the 
Borough must be justified by a detailed needs 
assessment. The starting point for the assessment 
should be the IDP .Applications must provide a 
sufficient level of detail for the Council to assess 
local area impacts on infrastructure provision, 
taking into account the location and nature of 
community uses involved. Proposals are strongly 
encouraged to refer the relevant key plans and 
strategies of the Council, its delivery partners 
and other stakeholders. Whilst the IDP is subject 
to regular review it may not always reflect the 
latest available information for certain types of 
infrastructure. Unless the development proposal 
is demonstrably associated with a public service 
transformation programme, in line with Policy 
CI1.C(c) above, or suitable replacement provision 
will be secured, applications must be also 
accompanied by evidence of an active marketing 
exercise covering a minimum continuous period 
of twelve months to help demonstrate that the 
site or facility is not suitable for a similar or 
alternative community use. 
9.5 The loss or a change of use of existing 
community infrastructure will be acceptable 
where it is clearly demonstrated that the disposal 
of assets is directly associated with a service 
transformation programme and necessary to 
deliver investment in public infrastructure and 
related services.  Applicants will be required to 
demonstrate through this programme that the 
facility in question is surplus to requirements or 
unviable in its current format, and that adequate 
provision will remain available to meet the needs 
of the local population. Where the public estate 
is involved, marketing information will not 
normally be required. 9.6 In limited and exceptional circumstances, where 
it is suitably demonstrated that the requirements 
of (C) above cannot be satisfied we may 
consider payment-in-lieu contributions. In these 
circumstances, we will require a statement clearly 
justifying why it is not feasible to re-provide 
the infrastructure, whether on-site as part of 
the redevelopment or off-site in kind. Where a 
loss is judged to be acceptable by the Council, 
payments will be negotiated on a case-by-case 
basis having regard to the type of provision in 
question, with contributions being invested in 
community infrastructure improvements within 
the Borough. Further details will be set out in 
an update to the Council’s Planning Obligations 
SPD.

A Development proposals for new community 
infrastructure (including the alteration, 
extension or reconfiguration of existing 
community infrastructure), will be supported 
where the facility:
a. Is appropriately located for the intended 
use; 
b. Is easily accessible by public transport, 
walking and cycling;
c. Is designed to maximise the flexibility and 
adaptability of space to accommodate a 
range of community uses;
d. Includes provision of well-integrated

functioning and viability of the community 
use, such as meeting spaces, broadband 
connection, kitchen facilities, toilets and 
dedicated storage space; 
e. Is made available for use by the public as 
much as reasonably practical, and does not 
unreasonably restrict access to the wider 
community; and
f. Will not result in a significant adverse 
impact on the amenity of neighbouring 
uses and properties.B Development proposals must make the best 
of use of land, including the public sector 
estate. Innovative approaches to community 
infrastructure provision (such as the co-
location of services, shared use of facilities and 
development of multi-use facilities) will be 
encouraged and supported where other Local 
Plan policies are satisfied.
C Development proposals for new community 
infrastructure must ensure that the facility 
will be appropriately managed and maintained 
over its lifetime.

9 COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
9.7 Community infrastructure is vital to supporting 
liveable neighbourhoods and inclusive 
communities. We will be broadly supportive 
of development proposals involving new or 
enhanced provision of community infrastructure, 
particularly where this helps to meet local 
needs. The IDP should be referred for further 
information on needs for new or improved 
community infrastructure in different parts of the 
Borough. 
9.8 Community facilities should be easily accessible 
by walking, cycling and public transport. 
Development proposals are encouraged to give 
priority to town and local centres in the site 
selection process. These locations generally 
benefit from higher Public Transport Access 
Levels. Community facilities can also support 
the vitality and viability of town centres by 
encouraging visitors and linked trips. However other locations  may be appropriate recognising 
that some community uses may not be ideally 
located in centres owing to space constraints, 
site availability or other requirements associated 
with the facility. All proposals must demonstrate 
that the site location is appropriate having 
regard to local need for the use, accessibility and 
compatibility with neighbouring land uses.
9.9 All development proposals for community 
infrastructure must investigate and, wherever 
feasible, incorporate design features that allow 
for flexibility and adaptability of the facility 
over its lifetime. Consideration should be given 
to designs that can accommodate a wide range 
of community uses. Service providers and 
developers are encouraged to engage with each 
other to identify opportunities for innovative 
designs that enable the co-location or shared 
use of facilities. This can help to support the 
TNG (RCK and Jakob Spriestersbach)
298viability of community infrastructure through 
frequent usage (ensuring the facility is not 
underused during non-peak hours) and make 
it more adaptable to the changing needs of the 
community over the long term.
9.10 Community facilities must be designed to a 
high quality standard using the design-led 
approach. They should be accessible and 
inclusive places that help to promote social 
cohesion. Development proposals must include 
well-integrated facilities that enable the effective 
use of the building as a community space. This 
may include kitchen areas, toilets and washing 
facilities, broadband connection, communal areas 
and meeting spaces, and generous dedicated 
storage space. Proposals will be refused where 
they do not suitably demonstrate that the 
development is designed to support the long-
term viability of the community use, whether 
as a standalone building or part of a mixed use 
development..
9.11 Development proposals for community 
infrastructure must make adequate arrangements 
for the maintenance and management of the 
facility over its lifetime. A Site Maintenance 
and/or Management Plan should be submitted 
prior to the occupation of development. 
Where facilities are integrated into new mixed-
use developments, these should be made as 
accessible as reasonably practical. We will refuse 
proposals for facilities where these unreasonably 
restrict public access, for example, for reasons of 
resident tenure.

300CI3 Sports, recreation and play 
A Development proposals should help to 
ensure that people of all ages and abilities 
have access to a wide range of opportunities 
for sports, recreation and play. They should 
maximise opportunities to provide new or 
improved community infrastructure, along with 
public realm enhancements, so that sports 
and recreation facilities and play spaces can 
be reached safely and easily throughout the 
Borough.
Sports and recreation facilities
B Existing sports and recreational facilities 
should be retained. Development proposals 
involving the loss of such facilities will 
only be permitted where they comply with 
London Plan Policy S5 (Sports and recreation 
facilities). Applications will be assessed taking 
into account the Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
along with the Council’s Playing Pitch Strategy, 
Physical Activity and Healthy Lifestyle Strategy 
and other strategies as appropriate.
Play and informal recreation
C Development proposals that are likely to 
be occupied or used by children and young 
people must increase opportunities for play 
and informal recreation. Where located in 
areas with identified deficiencies in play space, 
new housing development must provide 
demonstrable improvements in the quantity 
and quality of play space.D Development proposals for new housing must 
incorporate well-designed and high quality 
formal play provision of at least 10 square 
metres per child. Provision should be delivered 
on-site and made accessible to all children in 
the development without being segregated by 
housing tenure. Off-site provision will only be 
acceptable in exceptional circumstances, where 
it can be suitably demonstrated that on-site 
provision is not feasible and there is existing 
play space, or new provision that will be 
secured, in proximity to the development that 
can be accessed safely and easily by residents 
of the age group it is intended for.. Where it 
can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the 
Council that off-site provision is acceptable 
this will be secured through planning 
obligations and/or legal agreement, with 
payments in lieu calculated using the formula 
in Table 9.1 .

9 COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTUREE All play space and provision for informal 
recreation must be sensitively integrated into 
the site and neighbourhood, and be designed 
to:
a. Ensure that public access is encouraged 
and not unreasonably restricted, and made 
free-to-use wherever secured as part of new 
housing development;
b. Provide a stimulating and pleasant 
environment that promotes social cohesion, 
including by enabling users of different ages 
and abilities to interact as well as to move 
around and play independently;
c. Provide opportunities for respite, such as 
benches or seating areas;
d. Enable informal supervision through passive 
surveillance;
e. Integrate natural features such as trees, 
landscaped play areas and other greening 
measures; 
f. Maximise the use of permeable surfaces and 
Sustainable Drainage Systems; and
g. Site outdoor communal amenity and play 
spaces at the street level or ground floor of 
development, avoiding the use of rooftops 
and mezzanines.
F Where large-scale public realm is provided as 
part of a development proposal, this should 
incorporate incidental play space to make the 
public realm more playable. Incidental play 
space should supplement formal play provision 
elsewhere in the Borough and provide 
additional opportunities for physical activity.G Development proposals including new or 
enhanced play space must ensure the provision 
will be appropriately managed and maintained 
over its lifetime.
H Development proposals that will result in 
the loss of play space, whether existing or 
consented but not built, will be refused unless:
a. Replacement provision of at least an 
equivalent amount and improved quality will 
be provided, either on-site or in proximity 
to it, within a reasonable walking distance 
for the intended age group; or
b. It can be suitably demonstrated that there 
is no ongoing or future demand for the play 
space, with reference to the Lewisham Play 
Strategy.
302Explanation
9.12 Healthy and liveable neighbourhoods provide 
ample opportunities for people of all ages and 
abilities to participate in sport, recreation and 
play. Safe and stimulating play is essential to 
childhood development. It can impact positively 
on physical health, helping to address and 
prevent obesity. This is a key issue in Lewisham 
as 21 per cent of school children in Reception are 
obese, rising to 37 per cent in Year 6. Further, 
some 58 per cent of adults are obese96. Play is 
also important to mental health and wellbeing as 
it provides opportunities for learning and social 
interaction at the early stages and throughout 
life.
9.13 The Lewisham Playing Pitch Strategy (2019) 
includes an audit of sports and recreational 
facilities within the Borough and an assessment 
of future requirements over the plan period. 
Overall, it concludes that the Borough’s projected 
growth will result in a continued and rising 
demand for facilities. This includes dedicated 
facilities for sports such as football, cricket, 
rugby and field hockey as well as multi-purpose 
facilities, for example, leisure centres and sports 
halls. These future requirements are reflected 
in the IDP which development proposals will 
be expected to engage with. Given the current 
baseline situation it is unlikely that there will 
be a surplus of this type of infrastructure and 
the Local Plan therefore protects land and 
facilities that are in use for sport and recreation. Development proposals involving the loss of 
these types of uses will be considered against 
London Plan policy S5 (Sports and recreation). 
The Local Plan site allocations make provision 
for community uses that will help to enable 
identified needs to be addressed as new 
development is delivered, particularly within the 
Opportunity Areas. Further opportunities will be 
considered in the Council’s Physical Activity and 
Healthy Lifestyle strategy.
9.14 The Lewisham Open Spaces Assessment (2019) 
includes an audit of formal play provision in the 
Borough, looking at provision for different age 
groups. Whilst there is satisfactory provision 
across the Borough there are deficiencies in some 
areas, most notably to the south-east of Catford.  
To address local deficiencies and improve 
access to provision throughout the Borough, 
new development, particularly for housing and 
community infrastructure, should investigate 
and seek to increase opportunities for play for 
all age groups, taking into account the types of 
provision needed for them.
96 Lewisham Joint Strategic Needs Assessment: Picture of 
Lewisham, Part B. 2019.97 The scope of the open space assessment only included 
play sites that are in ownership and/or management of 
Lewisham Council. It is recognised that overall levels of play 
provision will also include space made by private providers 
and developments. The assessment provides a baseline 
position for applications to consider appropriate provision 
of play space in the locality.
303
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
9 COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE9.15 In line with the London Plan, new housing 
developments must provide formal play space 
of at least 10 square metres per child in order 
to address child occupancy and requirements 
generated by the development. Provision should 
be proportionally based on the number of 
children expected to occupy the development 
and an assessment of future needs. Play 
space should be delivered on-site. Off-site 
provision will only be considered in exceptional 
circumstances. Applicants will be required to 
provide evidence to demonstrate that delivery 
on-site is not feasible, including a design options 
appraisal, and that the needs generated by the 
development will be adequately met. Off-site 
provision will be more appropriate for older 
children and young people as they are able 
to travel slightly longer distances by walking 
and cycling. As well, suitable play provision 
for this group might not be compatible within 
the development and could be better provided 
elsewhere, for example, as with skateboard parks. 
Off-site provision will be secured by planning 
obligations or legal agreements, using the 
formula set out in Table 9.1 (Play space payments 
in lieu). Additional details on the play space 
standard and off-site provision  are set out in the 
Council’s Planning Obligations SPD and relevant 
London Plan guidance, currently the Play and 
Informal Recreation SPG.
9.16 All new play space should be delivered 
through the design-led approach with careful 
consideration given to the requirements of the 
intended users. Play space and other outdoor 
communal amenity space should be integrated 
at the street or ground floor level. The siting 
of provision on rooftops and mezzanine levels 
should be avoided as this may impede safe access and lead to provision being sited where 
microclimate conditions are not suitable. Rooftop 
and mezzanine space will only be acceptable 
where there is a clear design rationale and 
the provision is of an exceptional quality. 
Developments should maximise opportunities 
to integrate natural or semi-natural features 
into play space, including tree planting and 
landscaped play areas. Naturalised spaces provide 
for stimulating and pleasant environments, 
enhance access to nature, and also help to reduce 
the need for hardstanding which is important for 
climate change adaptation and mitigation.
9.17 To support inclusive neighbourhoods and 
communities we will seek to ensure that all 
play space is free to use and made accessible to 
the wider public. Development proposals that 
unreasonably restrict access to play space, for 
example, by fencing or other measures will be 
refused. Play space to which access is segregated 
by housing tenure is wholly unacceptable. 
It is recognised that some controls may be 
required in the interests of public health and 
safety as well as local amenity, for example, 
to ensure the use of facilities is limited to 
regular daytime or early evening hours. Site 
Management and/or Maintenance Plans should 
be submitted to address any such matters, along 
with arrangements for upkeep of space and 
equipment over the lifetime of the development. 
9.18 Activity and play need not be restricted to parks 
and other types of formal play spaces. Incidental 
play space can be provided where features of 
the urban environment are made more playable. 
This is particularly in areas with large-scale 
public realm (for example around town centres, 
stations and community facilities) where people 
304of all ages are likely to visit. The design of the 
public realm should encourage everyone to 
move around freely and independently in active 
ways, having regard to the Healthy Streets 
Approach and relevant good practice guidance, 
such as Sport England’s Active Design Guidance. 
Development proposals should assess how the 
design and configuration of spaces and buildings 
might function to impede or enhance safe access 
to play opportunities.

9 COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURECI4 Nurseries and childcare facilities
A Development proposals for day nurseries and 
childcare facilities (including child minding, 
playgroups and related activities) must:
a. Be located where they can be safely and 
easily accessed by walking, cycling and 
public transport;
b. Not have an unacceptable adverse impact 
on the road network and ensure adequate 
arrangements for car parking including 
access, egress, cross-site movement and 
drop-off areas, with consideration given to 
needs of disabled users;
c. Protect, manage and not adversely impact 
on local amenity;
d. Respond positively to local character; and
e. Secure provision of fit-for-purpose facilities 
to accommodate the intended use and all 
likely users, including suitable outside play 
space where appropriate.
B The use of residential floorspace for day 
nurseries and childcare facilities will only be 
supported where it is demonstrated that:
a. The development will not result in the loss 
of a dwelling and the residual residential 
floorspace meets the requirements and 
standards for self-contained housing, as set 
out elsewhere in the Local Plan;
b. The community use is ancillary to the 
residential use;
c. There is a demonstrable local need or 
market demand for the use proposed; and
d. There are no suitable and available non-
residential premises to accommodate the 
use.
306Explanation
9.19 Lewisham’s Childcare Sufficiency Assessment 
(2016) provides a baseline assessment of early 
education and includes key priorities for the 
childcare market in Lewisham. We are committed 
to ensuring that there is sufficient provision of 
good quality, affordable and flexible provision to 
accommodate the diverse needs of households 
within the Borough. All development proposals 
for nursery and childcare provision should 
therefore refer the latest Council assessment to 
identify opportunities for meeting demand and 
area specific requirements. 
9.20 New nurseries and childcare facilities should be 
appropriately located at safe, well-connected 
and easily accessible locations. Applicants should 
investigate opportunities to locate such uses 
in Class E units before considering residential 
premises. Where it is proposed to incorporate a 
nursery or childcare facility within an existing 
self-contained (Class C3) property, this must 
not result in the loss of a dwelling unit.. In most 
circumstances a detached C3 use will be more 
appropriate than a semi-detached unit, which 
in turn is preferential over a terraced dwelling. 
End of terrace locations will be treated the 
same as semi-detached properties. We may 
apply conditions to ensure residential uses are 
reinstated in any future change of use from a 
Class E community use.9.21 It is important that nurseries and childcare 
facilities are designed to a high quality standard 
and will meet the needs of specific uses and all 
intended users. Development proposals must 
demonstrate how the policy requirements will 
be satisfied. A statement should be submitted 
setting out details of operations including: 
nature of activity; numbers of staff and visitors 
expected; days and hours of operation; access, 
parking and servicing arrangements; and 
measures to protect local amenity.

9 COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURECI5 Burial space
A The Council will help to ensure that provision 
is made for the different burial needs of 
Lewisham’s communities by protecting existing 
cemeteries and working with stakeholders 
to appropriately maintain these, along with 
seeking opportunities to enhance the capacity 
of existing facilities for new burial space, 
where appropriate.
B Development proposals involving the provision 
of new burial space or related facilities must 
demonstrate that the provision:
a. Adequately meets the requirements of 
the various groups within the Borough, 
including those groups for whom burial is 
the only option; 
b. Is appropriately located and within 
reasonable proximity to the community it is 
intended to serve; 
c. Identifies and appropriately responds 
to potential flood risk issues, including 
through the incorporation of mitigation 
measures; and
d. Will not adversely impact on open spaces 
and biodiversity, with reference to other 
Local Plan policies.
308Explanation
9.22 Burial requirements vary amongst London’s 
diverse communities and different faith groups. 
Community cohesion and integration can be 
undermined in the absence of suitable local 
provision. There is no statutory duty for the 
Council to provide burial spaces however 
recognising the importance of providing 
opportunities for all individuals and communities 
to practice their faith, we have an interest 
in supporting provision to meet local needs 
wherever possible.
9.23 Information on burial space provision is drawn 
from Lewisham’s Open Space Study (2019) and 
the Greater London Authority commissioned 
research report, An Audit of London Burial 
Provision (2011). There are four cemetery sites 
in Lewisham: Brockley and Ladywell, Hither 
Green, Grove Park, and Bromley Hill (which is run 
by Bromley Council). The GLA audit concluded 
that Lewisham is in the ‘adequate’ category of 
capacity typologies. This is owing to the amount 
of reserve land in Lewisham’s cemeteries, which 
indicates it is probable that demand for burial 
space over the short to medium term can be met. 
We will therefore seek to protect the Borough’s 
existing provision of burial space.9.24 The Council is currently in the process of carrying 
out a local assessment of burial space provision. 
This will support our ongoing monitoring of 
provision and assist stakeholders in planning 
positively to meet community needs. We will 
continue to assess capacity available to meet 
Lewisham’s identified needs over the plan period, 
taking into account new planned provision and 
the impact of changes in legislation, including 
The Social Fund (Children’s Funeral Fund for 
England) Regulations 2019. 
9.25 Where capacity issues arise the re-use of existing 
spaces can assist in meeting demand and would 
be considered. The re-use of burial space is 
encouraged by the London Plan, following 
provisions set out in Section 74 of the Local 
Authorities Act 2007 and Section 25 of the 
Burial Act 1857 allowing for the re-use of graves 
in certain circumstances. The Council will seek 
to ensure that any proposals for re-use of burial 
space comply with the statutory requirements 
and are sensitive to the site, its surroundings and 
the local community.

A Lewisham’s network of green and open 
spaces, waterways and green features are 
a fundamental component of the natural 
environment. This network makes an 
important contribution to the Borough’s 
local distinctiveness including its character 
and heritage. It is also integral to supporting 
sustainable neighbourhoods and communities 
by providing a wide range of multifunctional 
environmental, social and economic benefits. 
Development proposals must protect and seek 
to enhance provision of green infrastructure 
across the Borough, including by improving 
or creating new links between its different 
elements.
B Development proposals must investigate and 
maximise opportunities to enhance existing 
green infrastructure and create new provision 
on site, with reference to the All London Green 
Grid. Consideration should be given to the 
site context including its setting within the 
wider landscape. Development proposals must 
make suitable arrangements for the long-term 
management of green areas and planting. This 
includes provision of sufficient space where 
large canopy trees can be retained and new 
trees established without pressure for their 
future removal.

10 GREEN INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
10.1 Green infrastructure refers to the Borough’s 
network of green and open spaces, waterways, 
street trees, green roofs, public and private 
residential gardens, allotments and other assets, 
such as semi-natural and natural drainage 
features. It includes parks and public spaces 
as well as private gardens and other spaces 
with vegetation. Together these elements of 
the environment help to support strategic 
objectives across a number of policy areas such 
as: promoting public health and wellbeing, 
mitigating against and adapting to the impacts of 
climate change (including by reducing flood risk), 
improving air and water quality, and conserving 
natural habitats and species. A strategic approach 
to green infrastructure is necessary to ensure that 
green assets are protected, planned for, designed 
and managed in an integrated way. In London’s  
urbanised context it is important that the 
multifunctional benefits of green infrastructure 
are recognised and proactively addressed. Green 
infrastructure must not be considered in isolation 
of other aspects of the built environment.10.2 Whilst the environmental value of green 
infrastructure is clearly evident its social and 
economic value is becoming increasingly 
recognised. Lewisham’s Open Spaces Assessment 
(2020) includes information on the natural 
capital account, which considers the economic, 
social and environmental value of green 
infrastructure.  Research indicates that Lewisham 
currently enjoys benefits accruing from green 
infrastructure to a value of up to £2.1 billion, 
a figure that is comparable to the adjacent 
inner-London Boroughs. This helps to put into 
perspective the wider benefits of the local 
network of green infrastructure.
10.3 The protection and enhancement of green 
infrastructure in Lewisham is necessary to 
support the London Plan objective to make 
London at least 50 per cent green by 2050and 
to support its National Park City status. Many of 
the Borough’s trees are located in private gardens 
especially at the ends of rear gardens where 
combined garden areas provide the space for 
large canopy trees to develop and mature. These 
trees contribute to the Borough’s urban forest 
and  provide benefits including rear outlook 
amenity, wildlife habitat, air pollution reduction, 
improved ground drainage, climate change 
mitigation and health and wellbeing benefits.  
98 The Corporate Natural Capital Accounting (CNCA) is 
a methodology used to assess the social, economic and 
environmental value of green infrastructure, and was 
developed by the Natural Capital Committee in its report to 
the UK Government. It considers factors such as the costs 
of public inactivity, the value of recreational visits to green 
infrastructure, impact of green infrastructure on property 
values, and the value of the various environmental 
functions green infrastructure performs. See Lewisham’s 
Open Space Assessment (2020) for further details.
314Development proposals should retain these 
trees for their ecosystem services and avoid 
compromising and encroaching available space 
for them. This includes, for example, smaller 
developments involving building extensions, 
garden studios, the subdividing of houses and 
gardens as well as larger redevelopment schemes.
10.4 The London Mayor has prepared supplementary 
planning guidance on the All London Green 
Grid (ALGG)99.  The ALGG promotes the creation 
of a high quality and multifunctional green 
infrastructure network across London with 
the principal aim of supporting sustainable 
communities. The ALGG includes different types 
of open spaces, green corridors and the linkages 
between these (including wider public realm, 
corridors along transport routes, footpaths and 
cycle ways). The ALGG defines a number of 
Green Grid Areas across the region and Lewisham 
sits within the ‘South East London Green Chain 
Plus’ area. The Local Plan helps give effect 
to the ALGG and some of the key strategic 
objectives are reflected in the sub-areas section 
of this Plan. All development proposals will be 
expected to positively engage with the ALGG 
guidance in supporting a linked network of green 
infrastructure locally that improves public access 
to open spaces.

Lewisham’s Green Grid and will be protected 
from inappropriate development, in accordance 
with Lewisham’s open space hierarchy.
Designated Open Spaces
B Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) and Local 
Green Space (LGS) are afforded the same level 
of protection as Green Belt. Development 
proposals on MOL and LGS will be considered 
in accordance with the London Plan and 
national planning policies that apply to Green 
Belt land.
C Development proposals involving the loss of 
Strategic Open Space will be strongly resisted 
and only permitted in the following exceptional 
circumstances:
a. Replacement provision of at least an 
equivalent amount (i.e. no net loss) 
and better quality will be provided. The 
replacement provision must: 
i. Be located within the Borough and in 
reasonable proximity to the existing open 
space, with equivalent or better access by 
walking, cycling and public transport;
ii. Not result in an increase in public open 
space deficiency; 
iii. Be publicly accessible; 
b. The development will provide a wider public 
benefit which clearly outweighs the loss of 
the existing open space;
c. There will be no adverse impact on 
biodiversity, with reference to Policy GR3 
(Biodiversity and access to nature);d. Suitable replacement provision will be made 
for outdoor sports facilities or playing fields, 
with reference to London Plan policy S5 
(Sports and recreation facilities), as well as 
allotments and community gardens where 
appropriate; and
e. Where the development involves part of 
an area of open space the quality of any 
remaining open space will not be eroded by 
the development.
D Where development proposals satisfy the 
requirements of GR3.C above, the full 
quantity of replacement open space must be 
secured prior to the commencement of the 
development. Planning conditions and/or 
legal agreements will be used to ensure the 
open space is appropriately secured.
E Neighbourhood forums are encouraged to 
undertake detailed assessments to identify 
appropriate sites to designate as Local Green 
Space in neighbourhood development plans.
Neighbourhood Open Space 
F Development proposals involving the 
reconfiguration of Neighbourhood Open Space 
will only be supported where:
a. There is no net loss of open space, 
including play space, and net gains are 
achieved wherever possible;
b. There is no detrimental impact on the 
environmental function of the open space, 
including support for nature conservation;

to CI 3 (Play and informal recreation) and 
EC 20 (Markets). Ancillary uses
H Development proposals for ancillary uses on 
open space that help to improve the quality of 
open space and promote access to a wide range 
of users will be supported where they:
a. Are demonstrably ancillary to the use of land 
as open space;
b. Are necessary to facilitate or support the 
appropriate use of the open space;
c. Do not have a detrimental impact on the 
environmental function of the open space, 
including support for nature conservation;
d. Respond positively to local character, 
including by maintaining or enhancing the 
visual quality of the open space and its 
setting;
e. Are of a scale and function that is 
proportionate to the nature of the open 
space; and 
f. Are of a high quality design, including by 
following inclusive and safe design principles, 
and do not detract from the amenity provided 
by the open space.
Enhancing the quality and function of open 
spaces
I Development proposals, should maximise 
opportunities to introduce new publicly 
accessible open space, giving priority to green 
space, as well as improve connections to existing 
or planned new open spaces, particularly in areas 
of open space deficiency. Major developments 
must incorporate new publicly accessible open 
space unless it can be clearly demonstrated 
that this is not feasible, in which case off-site 
contributions may be required. 
318
J With reference to Policy GR4 (Lewisham 
Links) development must maintain and 
wherever possible enhance access to and 
connections between the network of open 
spaces within and outside the Borough. 
Priority should be given to measures that 
encourage walking, cycling and other active 
travel modes along routes that link open 
spaces such as the South East London Green 
Chain, Waterlink Way, the Thames Path and 
other local elements of the All London Green 
Grid. 
K Development proposals located adjacent 
to open space must respond positively to 
the character of the open space as well as 
protect, and wherever possible enhance, 
the biodiversity value and visual amenity 
provided by it.

Explanation
10.5 Open spaces form a vital component of 
Lewisham’s Green Grid and London’s network 
of green infrastructure. Open spaces, including 
waterways and water spaces, make a significant 
contribution to the environmental quality and 
character of the Borough. They also play a 
key role in supporting the physical and mental 
health and wellbeing of the local population by 
providing opportunities for leisure and recreation 
as well as enabling people to lead active 
lifestyles. Lewisham benefits from provision 
of a wide range of good quality open spaces 
which total around one-fifth of the area of the 
Borough.  Some open spaces contain protected 
habitats or species and are designated as Sites 
of Importance for Nature Conservation. Further 
details are set out in Policy GR3 (Biodiversity and 
access to nature).
10.6 As the Borough’s population increases the 
pressure on existing parks and open spaces 
will invariably rise. The Lewisham Open Spaces 
Assessment (2020) considers the amount 
of open space that is needed to support the 
projected future population over the plan period, 
based on a fixed quantity standard. This suggests 
that a significant amount of additional provision 
will be required to maintain the standard over 
the long-term. Due to the finite availability of 
land and requirement to accommodate new 
development to meet local needs, such as for 
housing and workspace, there will be limited 
opportunities to create new larger open spaces, 
such as Local or District level parks. It is therefore 
vitally important that open spaces are protected, 
measures are taken to improve their function 
and quality, and that public access to open 
space is enhanced.  As well, that major and 
other developments maximise opportunities to integrate new publicly accessible open space. 
The Lewisham Parks and Open Spaces Strategy 
will support the implementation of the Local 
Plan. It sets out key priorities for delivering 
improvements to parks and access to them.
10.7 In accordance with London Plan policy G4 
(Open space), the Local Plan sets out a hierarchy 
of open spaces. It also includes policies to 
protect these spaces commensurate with their 
categorisation in the hierarchy (Table 7.1). 
An additional open space study was prepared 
in 2022, which provides evidence to inform 
appropriate land-use designations and policies 
to protect and sensitively manage open and 
green spaces within the borough. The open 
space categorisations broadly reflect those set 
out in national and regional planning policy 
and guidance100 but they have been adapted 
to reflect Lewisham’s local circumstances. 
Metropolitan Open Land and Strategic Open 
Space are designated on the Policies Map 
whilst Local Green Space is designated in 
Neighbourhood Plans. These strategic open 
spaces and their boundaries have been 
informed by numerous evidence base studies101. 
100 This includes London Plan policy G4 (Open space), 
Table 8.1 and Planning Policy Guidance 17. It is noted that 
PPG17 was replaced by the NPPF and the Government’s 
Assessing Needs and Opportunities Companion Guide by 
the NPPG. However, the Companion Guide’s methodology 
and typologies continue to be recognised as good practice 
in London and England for land-use planning.

Open Space Review (2022), Lewisham Metropolitan Open 
Land Review (2020) and MOL Additional Sites Report 
(2021). Neighbourhood Plans should be referred for 
information on Local Green Space.

322Neighbourhood Open Spaces are not designated 
on the Policies Map. However the Local Plan 
recognises the important contribution these spaces 
make to liveable and sustainable neighbourhoods.  
10.8 Development proposals involving the loss of 
Strategic or Neighbourhood Open Space should 
be avoided and will only be permitted exceptional 
circumstances, as set out in the policy above. The 
reconfiguration of Neighbourhood Open Space can 
be an effective approach to addressing deficiencies 
in the quantity and quality of provision. It can also 
help to overcome site constraints where it would 
otherwise be difficult to deliver new development, 
(such as for housing, workspace or community 
facilities) or area improvements. Development 
proposals involving the reconfiguration of open 
space must provide demonstrable improvements in 
the functional value of open and public access to it. 
In order to ensure certainty over the protection of 
open space and beneficial outcomes for the wider 
community and the environment, all proposals 
for reconfiguration must be delivered through 
comprehensive redevelopment and in line with a 
site-wide masterplan.
10.9 The Lewisham Open Spaces Assessment provides 
an overview of existing open space provision across 
the Borough and in neighbouring authorities. It 
includes an assessment of public access to these 
open spaces and identifies areas where there are 
deficiencies in access to certain types of provision. 
Whilst all development proposals should investigate 
and maximise opportunities to enhance open space 
this is particularly important in areas of deficiency. 
We will expect all development proposals to refer to and engage with the Open Spaces Assessment, or 
any subsequent update, through the design-led 
approach. Furthermore, proposals should refer 
the deficiency maps developed by Greenspace 
Information for Greater London (GiGL). These 
are regularly updated taking into account the 
latest available information on open spaces, 
and use a method of accurately mapping areas 
of deficiency in public access based on actual 
walking distances along roads and paths.
10.10 New development can help to enhance access 
to open space even where it is not feasible to 
deliver new public open space on site. Through 
the design-led approach development proposals 
should seek to deliver public realm enhancements 
to create new routes or improve connections 
to existing or planned new open spaces, 
particularly in areas of deficiency. Planning 
contributions towards open space provision may 
be sought, particularly where development is 
likely to generate additional demands on existing 
provision such through the introduction of more 
residential units and households. Contributions 
may include measures that support public access 
to open space along with the functional quality 
and amenity value of it. 
10.11 The NPPF enables neighbourhood forums 
to designate Local Green Space through the 
neighbourhood plan process. Local Green Space 
is afforded the same level of protection as Green 
Belt. Forums are well placed to identify high 
quality green spaces that are valued by the local 
community and whose protection will support the 
Local Plan. Forums are encouraged to undertake 
detailed assessments to justify the designation of 
Local Green Space using a robust methodology. 
Assessments should be published as part of the 
evidence base to support the plan-making and 
examination process.323

A The Council will work positively with 
stakeholders, including the Lewisham 
Biodiversity Partnership, to promote and 
secure the conservation, restoration and 
management of habitats as well as the 
protection of species. It will prepare a Local 
Nature Recovery Strategy (LNRS) as part of 
a strategic approach to nature conservation 
and to deliver Biodiversity Net Gain within the 
Borough.  
B Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SINCs) are safeguarded in the Local Plan. 
Development proposals must protect and 
maximise opportunities to enhance the wildlife 
value of SINC sites. They must also protect and 
conserve protected and priority habitats and 
species that sit outside of the SINC network, 
with reference to the London Environment 
Strategy.  
C Development proposals must seek to avoid 
harm to biodiversity including within SINC 
sites and Local Nature Reserves. In line with 
London Plan policy G3 (Biodiversity and 
access to nature), where it is demonstrated 
that harm is unavoidable, and where the 
benefits of the development proposal clearly 
outweigh the impacts on biodiversity, the 
following mitigation hierarchy must be applied 
to minimise impacts:
a. Avoid damaging the significant ecological 
features of the site;
b. Minimise the overall spatial impact and 
mitigate it by improving the quality or 
management of the rest of the site; and
c. Deliver off-site compensation of better 
biodiversity value.D Development proposals that have the potential 
to impact on designated international or 
national nature conservation sites located 
outside of the Borough must ensure that 
impacts are assessed in accordance with the 
relevant legislative requirements. Proposals 
will be considered having regard to national 
planning policies and legislation.
E Development proposals should seek to secure 
Biodiversity Net Gain. The BNG benchmark is a 
minimum 10 per cent increase in habitat value 
for wildlife compared with the pre-development 
baseline, calculated using an appropriate 
Biodiversity Metric. Biodiversity should be fully 
integrated into the design-led approach with 
consideration given to the site context and its 
wider landscape setting.
F All major development proposals and other 
development proposals that are likely to 
have a direct or indirect adverse impact on a 
SINC, Local Nature Reserve or other site with 
biodiversity interests must submit an Ecological 
Assessment carried out by a chartered ecologist. 
Major development proposals adjacent to a 
SINC should consult the Lewisham Biodiversity 
Partnership to assist with the assessment of 
potential impacts on the site and opportunities 
to enhance the site’s biodiversity value.
G Planning conditions and/or legal agreements 
may be used to secure Management Plans 
where these are considered necessary to 
support nature conservation objectives.
H Development proposals that help to reduce 
deficiencies in the population’s access to nature 
will be considered favourably.

10 GREEN INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
10.12 Lewisham features a wide variety of wildlife 
habitats. These including designated Sites of 
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs), 
Local Nature Reserves and other areas with 
habitat value such as parks and open spaces, 
ecological corridors, waterways, woodlands and 
other green spaces. It is imperative that the 
wildlife value of these habitats is protected with 
appropriate  maintenance regimes in place to 
maintain or enhance their wildlife value over 
the long-term. This is important not only for 
nature conservation but also to maximise the 
multifunctional benefits associated with green 
infrastructure. The State of Nature Report 
(2019)102makes clear the issues around the 
decline in the abundance and distribution of 
species in England and the UK.  The Council will 
continue to work with stakeholders, including 
the Lewisham Biodiversity Partnership, to 
support nature conservation and fulfil its 
statutory obligations. The Environment Act 2021 
sets out the framework for a national Nature 
Recovery Network which local authorities will 
support through the preparation of Local Nature 
Recovery Strategies (LNRS). 
10.13 Growth and regeneration can be compatible 
with nature conservation objectives when 
development is considered in a holistic way. 
Considerations for nature conservation must 
therefore be fully integrated into the design-led approach. Development proposals must seek 
to avoid harm to and protect biodiversity as 
well as maximise opportunities to enhance the 
value of habitats wherever possible. Applicants 
should refer the latest Lewisham Biodiversity 
Action Plan, currently A Natural Renaissance for 
Lewisham (2021), which sets out information on 
the vision and opportunities for the Borough.
10.14 A review of SINCs has been undertaken to inform 
the preparation of the Local Plan103.  Lewisham 
contains Metropolitan, Borough and Local SINCS 
which are designated on the Policies Map. 
Additional ecology surveys of the Hither Green to 
Grove Park corridor were undertaken in 2022 to 
inform proposals to combine several SBINC sites 
to form a single Site of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) of Metropolitan status. 
The level of protection afforded to SINCs is 
commensurate with their status and contribution 
to the wider ecological network. There are also 
priority habitats and species outside of SINCs 
which are given protection through this policy. 
The London Environment Strategy includes 
a comprehensive list of priority habitats and 
species that require particular consideration for 
planning decisions. The Lewisham Biodiversity 
Action Plan should also be referred for 
information.

104 International sites are designated under European 
Union Council Directive on the conservation of wild birds 
(79/409/ EEC) 1992, European Union Council Directive 
on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna 
and flora (92/43/EEC) 1992 and Ramsar Convention on 
wetlands of international importance.
330international or national nature conservation 
sites104. However there are 4 such sites within 
15 kilometres of the Borough boundary which, 
given their proximity, have the potential to be 
impacted by development. These sites include 
the Lee Valley Special Protection Area (SPA) 
and the Richmond Park, Wimbledon Common 
and Epping Forest Special Areas of Conservation 
(SAC). Where a development proposal has the 
potential to impact on a site by virtue of its 
location, nature of use or scale, then applicants 
should consult Natural England to confirm 
whether a Habitats Regulations Assessment is 
required. Development proposals likely to have 
significant adverse impacts on international or 
national sites will be considered against relevant 
national planning policies and legislation.
10.16 Development proposals must clearly identify 
biodiversity interests both within and in 
proximity to the site and assess impacts on 
them. They should demonstrate how the 
development will respond positively to these 
interests The NPPF sets out principles for 
determining planning applications where there 
is a potential or likely harm to biodiversity.  
These are reflected both by the London 
Plan and this policy. Where it is clearly and 
convincingly demonstrated that harm to 
biodiversity105cannot reasonably be avoided 
then appropriate mitigation measures will be required, with biodiversity offsetting used as a 
last resort. Mitigation measures should support 
implementation of Lewisham’s Biodiversity Action 
Plan and may be secured by way of planning 
obligations or planning conditions. Proposals 
must clearly address why mitigation measures are 
necessary and any such mitigation must be agreed 
with the Council in advance of the commencement 
of development. 
10.17  Proposals for major development and other 
development with a potential to have a direct or 
indirect impact on a SINC, LNR or other site with 
biodiversity interest must submit an up-to-date 
Ecological Assessment. This must be carried out 
by a chartered ecologist, such as one registered 
with the Chartered Institute of Ecology and 
Environmental Management (CIEMM). Surveys 
should be carried out during an optimal time of 
the year for observation. They must contain a 
sufficient amount of detail to identify and consider 
the relevant biodiversity interests and potential 
impacts on them. Applicants are expected to make 
surveys available to Greenspace Information for 
Greater London (GiGL) to assist in the collection of 
information in Lewisham and the region, and aid 
in the future delivery of the Lewisham Biodiversity 
Action Plan. Development proposals should

10 GREEN INFRASTRUCTUREconsider biodiversity taking into account the 
relationship between different land uses within 
and in proximity to the site, along with amenity 
considerations such as lighting and shading. 
10.18 The Environment Act 2021 introduces provisions 
for Biodiversity Net Gain. The mandatory 
requirement for BNG on qualifying developments 
will apply in England and are to be brought into 
force through future amendments to the Town and 
Country Planning Act106. To ensure the alignment 
with the new legislative framework the Local Plan 
seeks that development proposals secure BNG. 
The BNG benchmark is a minimum 10 per cent 
increase in habitat value for wildlife compared 
with the pre-development baseline, calculated 
using an appropriate Biodiversity Metric107.  
The Lewisham Local Plan Viability Assessment 
(2022) indicates that this requirement will have 
a negligible impact on development viability108.  
Policy GR3.E will be used as a guide until such 
time further legislation and national policy 
take effect. BNG should normally be delivered 
on-site. However flexibility may be applied on 
a case-by-case basis where it is demonstrated 
that on-site provision is not feasible or off-site 
contributions will provide greater biodiversity 
benefits, for example, by contributing to the 
restoration or recovery of habitats within sites or areas identified in a LNRS or other similar 
document. Development proposals should refer 
to good practice guidance such as the British 
Standard BS 8683:2021 Process for designing 
and implementing Biodiversity Net Gain.
10.19 Development proposals may be required to 
be accompanied by a Management Plan. This 
will normally be secured by way of planning 
condition. The need for a Management Plan will 
be established on a case-by-case basis taking 
into account the biodiversity interests on or in 
proximity to the site, as well as the nature and 
scale of development proposed. Management 
Plans can help to ensure that habitats and 
species are not harmed during the construction 
process, and that that site specific interventions 
and mitigation measures are fulfilling their 
objectives over the lifetime of the development, 
including through regular maintenance and 
monitoring. Applicants are strongly encouraged 
to liaise with local stakeholders, including the 
Lewisham Biodiversity Partnership, to discuss 
opportunities for support in this regard.
10.20 Access to nature is important as it offers 
opportunities for respite, relaxation and 
education. People in Lewisham generally benefit 
from good access to green and open spaces. 
However in some parts of the Borough people 
do not enjoy easy access to green spaces with 
wildlife value. Localities where people are 
further than 1 kilometre walking distance from 
a publicly accessible site of Metropolitan or 
Borough level SINC are defined by the London 
Plan as ‘areas of deficiency’. Lewisham has 5 
such areas covering 14 per cent of the Borough. 
The largest of these is located in the northwest, 
spreading from the River Thames in the north 106 The Government published a consultation on 
Biodiversity Net Gain Regulations and Implementation 
which ran from January to April 2022. 
107 The Government published the BNG 3.1 Metric (JP039) 
on 21 April 2022. This should be used as a guide for 
calculating BNG, or where appropriate, a future equivalent.
108 The study tested BNG to be secured in perpetuity by 
applying an increase in build costs of 0.8 per cent, which 
is the upper end of the range indicated in the 2019 DEFRA 
report Biodiversity Net Gain and Local Nature Recovery

332to Brockley in the south and the boundary 
with Southwark in the east. The other four 
areas, which are smaller and more discrete, are 
located around Deptford, Forest Hill, Lee and 
Lewisham town centre. Where new development 
comes forward opportunities should be taken to 
introduce additional biodiversity features across 
the Borough, and particularly in the areas of 
deficiency. Further information is set out in the 
Lewisham Re-Survey of Sites of Importance for 
Nature Conservation Study (2016). Development 
proposals, should refer the deficiency maps 
developed by Greenspace Information for 
Greater London (GiGL). These are regularly 
updated taking into account the latest available 
information on nature sites, and use a method of 
accurately mapping areas of deficiency in public 
access based on actual walking distances along 
roads and paths.

10 GREEN INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
10.21 This policy forms a key part of the Local Plan 
approach to delivering healthy, liveable and 
sustainable neighbourhoods. The Lewisham Links 
will help to ensure that people throughout the 
Borough are both encouraged and enabled to 
make more journeys by active travel modes, taking 
advantage of a high quality and well-connected 
network of walking routes and cycleways. The 
Lewisham Links will improve people’s access to and 
between parks, open spaces, community facilities, 
and other key visitor destinations such as town 
centres and public transport nodes. The policy 
builds on the success of the North Lewisham Links 
Strategy. This sets out a programme of public realm 
improvements focused on priority walking routes 
and cycleways, or ‘links’, parts of which have now 
been delivered. The Strategy was developed in 
response to issues of severance caused by major 
roads and railways in Deptford and New Cross, as 
well as the need to secure new infrastructure to 
support growth and regeneration.
10.22 Development proposals must make provision for 
public realm enhancements where the site contains 
or is adjacent to an existing or proposed route of 
the Lewisham links. The specific nature of public 
realm enhancements will be considered on a case-
by-case basis taking into account the nature of 
the development along with the site size, location 
and contribution required to support the effective 
functioning and quality of the Lewisham Links. 
Further details are set out in Part 3 of the Local Plan 
for each of the Borough’s character areas. Whilst the 
Lewisham Links will connect a wide variety of visitor 
destinations there is a strong focus on connections 
to and between green spaces. Development 
proposals should therefore refer to the Lewisham 
Parks and Open Spaces Strategy.
338GR5 Urban greening and trees 
A Development proposals must demonstrate 
how the design-led approach has been 
used to  maximise opportunities for urban 
greening. This includes  the integration of 
high quality and species diverse landscaping, 
street trees, wildlife habitat, green roofs and 
walls and Sustainable Drainage Systems. They 
must be designed with  consideration given 
to the site context  and the wider landscape 
setting as well as the layout, design, 
construction and long-term management of 
buildings and spaces.
B Development proposals must respond 
positively to landforms including by retaining 
or enhancing landscape features of historic, 
ecological and visual amenity value.
C Major development proposals must 
increase green cover on site to achieve 
the recommended target Urban Greening 
Factor (UGF) in the London Plan, unless it 
can be suitably demonstrated that this is 
not feasible. The target UGF score is 0.4 
for predominantly residential development 
and 0.3 for predominantly commercial 
development (excluding B2 and B8 uses). 
Existing green cover retained on-site will 
count towards the target score. Planning 
contributions may be sought where the target 
UGF is not achieved.
D Development proposals should maximise 
the use of green roofs and walls. Major 
development proposals will be expected to 
demonstrate that the feasibility of integrating 
these measures has been fully investigated, and minor development proposals are strongly 
encouraged to incorporate them. Green 
roofs and walls will be supported where 
they are appropriately designed, installed 
and maintained. Development proposals 
should have regard to the latest industry 
good practice guidance to help ensure 
that green roofs and walls are designed to 
maximise environmental benefits and will 
function effectively over the lifetime of the 
development.
E Development proposals must seek to retain 
existing trees as well as the associated 
habitat with regard for the urban forest, with 
reference to Policy GR3 (Biodiversity and 
access to nature).They should also maximise 
opportunities for additional tree planting 
particularly in urbanised locations such as 
streets and town centres.  Development 
proposals must demonstrate that they will:
a. Provide for the sensitive integration 
of all trees whilst ensuring any new or 
replacement on-site provision is of a high 
ecological quality (including appropriate 
species, stem girth and life expectancy) and 
contributes positively to the microclimate; 
b. Protect veteran trees and ancient woodland;
c. Retain trees of quality and associated 
habitat, wherever possible, with appropriate 
arrangements to secure their protection 
throughout demolition,  construction, and 
external works, to the occupation stage of 
development;
d. Avoid the loss of, and mitigate against 
adverse impacts on, trees of significant 
ecological, amenity and historical value;

to be climate change resilient in proximity 
to trees; and
f. Ensure adequate replacement tree 
planting where the retention of trees is 
not reasonably practical, with replacement 
provision that meets the requirements of (a) 
above.
F Development proposals should avoid, and the 
Council will refuse, the removal of protected 
trees (i.e. those covered by a Tree Protection 
Order and trees within Conservation Areas) 
and developments that will have a detrimental 
impact on the health of protected trees and 
visual amenity provided by them . The Council 
may identify and seek to protect trees that are 
of a significant amenity, heritage, ecological, 
or other value through the development 
management process.
G Major development proposals, and where 
appropriate other development proposals, 
will be required to submit a Landscape 
Design Strategy and Arboriculture Survey to 
demonstrate that landscaping and other urban 
greening measures are appropriate to the 
site, can be implemented effectively and will 
be suitably managed over the lifetime of the 
development.

Explanation
10.23 Urban greening is a term used to describe a wide 
range of measures that can be incorporated into 
buildings and spaces to increase green cover in 
the Borough. These measures includebut are not 
limited to: tree planting, naturalised biodiverse 
landscaping, green roofs and walls, hedges, 
climbers, plants for pollinators, de-paving, rain 
gardens and sustainable drainage systems using 
natural or semi-natural features. Urban greening 
can provide multifunctional benefits  such as for 
climate change resilience, amenity including air 
quality, nature conservation and local character.
10.24  The London Plan sets the Urban Greening Factor 
(UGF) requirement for major developments. The 
UGF is a model used to provide a baseline for the 
amount of green cover that development will be 
expected to achieve, taking into account various 
site development factors. We will apply the 
recommended UGF factors for major residential 
and commercial development as set by the 
London Plan. Existing green cover retained on 
site as part of a development proposal will count 
towards the target UGF score. Relevant major 
development proposals should meet and seek 
to exceed the target score. Some flexibility may 
be applied on a case-by-case basis where it is 
suitably demonstrated that the target cannot 
be achieved for reasons of technical feasibility 
or financial viability, in which case proposals 
should show that they have been designed to 
achieve the highest score possible. Development 
proposals should refer the Mayor’s Urban 
Greening Factor SPG109. 10.25 Green roofs and walls will normally be required as 
part of the package of urban greening measures 
delivered on sites. They will be supported where 
they appropriately respond to local character 
and comply with other Local Plan policies. 
This includes consideration for the historic 
environment, where development must preserve 
the significance of heritage assets. Green roof 
assembly should as a minimum consist of a root 
repellent system, a drainage system, a filtering 
layer, a growing medium and plants, and be 
installed on a waterproof membrane on an 
applicable roof. Buildings should be designed to 
have sufficient structural capacity and integrity 
to resist all loads for soil, moistures, plants, 
rain and wind uplift, safely, effectively and 
permanently. It is important that living roofs are 
included in the early planning and design stage 
and supported by a qualified and accredited 
installer. Green roofs should be designed in with 
photovoltaic panels. Development proposals 
must demonstrate how the installation and 
maintenance will comply with the latest industry 
standards, currently  the Green Roof Code of 
Best Practice for the UK 2014, or any national 
equivalent.

10 GREEN INFRASTRUCTURETrees
10.26 Trees and the urban forest are an integral part of 
the Borough’s network of green infrastructure 
and have many beneficial functions. In addition 
to enhancing local character and amenity, 
including air quality, they provide extensive 
areas of habitat for wildlife. Trees also have an 
important role in climate change adaptation 
and mitigation. For example, they reduce strain 
on drainage systems by absorbing rainfall and 
enable positive microclimatic effects through 
cover and shade. Recognising the significant 
environmental value of trees the London Plan 
sets out the Mayor’s aspirations to increase tree 
cover in London by 10 per cent by 2050, which 
this policy provides support for. The London 
Environment Strategy (2018) and London Urban 
Forest Plan (2020) provide further details on tree 
canopy cover and the urban forest.
10.27 Trees should be considered at the early stages 
of the design-led approach in order to maximise 
their many beneficial effects. Where development 
proposals include elements of public realm 
tree provision must be commensurate with the 
nature and scale of development. Development 
proposals will be expected to retain and protect 
existing trees, ensuring they can be sustained 
over the long-term. This includes trees of quality 
which are Category A and B trees as defined 
by British Standard BS5837:2012 and also 
Category C & U trees within biodiverse habitat 
areas. New development should not result in an 
unacceptable harm to or loss of trees, particularly 
where these are protected by a Tree Preservation 
Order, are located in a Conservation Area or make 
a significant contribution to local ecology, public 
amenity and local character, including historic character. Whilst acknowledging the Council 
has limited control in terms of the protection of 
trees in private residential gardens, it will seek to 
promote the multifunctional benefits of trees and 
prevent the loss of trees wherever possible.
10.28 Where it can be suitably demonstrated that the 
loss of a tree is acceptable, such as when the tree 
is considered dangerous to the public or where its 
removal is necessary to secure site redevelopment 
consistent with the spatial strategy, then 
replacement planting will be required. Priority 
will be given to on-site replacement unless it 
can be demonstrated there are exceptional 
circumstances which necessitate off-site 
provision, in which case planning contributions 
may be sought. When a financial obligation is 
required for replacement trees the value may 
be calculated using the Capital Asset Value for 
Amenity Trees (CAVAT) or a similar methodology. 
Financial contributions will be expected to 
include on-going maintenance costs where trees 
are planted in the public realm.
10.29 New or replacement species should be selected 
to avoid the risk of decline or death arising from 
increases in non-native pests and diseases. Where 
new trees are to be planted, the species type 
should be chosen using the ‘Right Place Right 
Tree’ approach as advocated by the Mayor’s 
London Tree and Woodland Framework. When 
purchasing trees, they should be responsibly 
sourced ideally from a domestic nursery with 
UK grown or imported trees appropriately 
quarantined for a minimum of one year within 
the UK before sale. This ensures plant health and 
non-infection by foreign pests or disease. 
34210.30 The Council makes Tree Preservation Orders 
(TPOs) to protect specific trees or particular 
areas, groups or woodland with amenity value 
from deliberate damage and destruction. If a 
tree is subject to a TPO, consent will be required 
before any work that might affect the tree can be 
carried out. It is a criminal offence to prune, fell 
or damage protected trees without appropriate 
consent and the Council will enforce breaches in 
accordance with relevant policy and legislation.
Landscape design strategy
10.31 A site’s landscape and its relationship to existing 
and future development, and immediate 
surrounds, should be considered comprehensively 
from the start of the design-led approach. 
Proposals should have regard to the existing 
character of the site including landform and 
features of the natural landscape (such as trees 
on or in proximity to the site). Where existing 
landscapes contribute to local distinctiveness, 
development should respond positively to those 
features. Applicants are encouraged to refer 
Lewisham’s Characterisation Study as a useful 
starting point for understanding landscape 
features in the Borough. 
10.32 A Landscape Design Strategy must be included 
with all major development proposals and 
proposals for sites where a Tree Preservation 
Order is in place. Other applications may also 
be required to provide this information having 
regard to individual site circumstances and the 
biodiversity interests involved. The Landscape 
Design Strategy must include an assessment of 
the relevant site features and nature conservation 
interests, details of work required to ensure 
the successful implementation of the strategy, 
and a Management Plan. The Management Plan should address maintenance of hard and 
soft landscaping features over the lifetime of 
the development, with specific details covering 
a minimum 5-year period from occupation. 
Considerations may include: planting plans with 
species, frequency of maintenance operations 
such as weeding, irrigation and the use of 
hydration bags for trees, checking stakes and 
ties, plant condition, mowing times for long 
grass sward areas, materials and minimising hard 
surfacing, details of building subsidence and 
other liabilities such as climate change resilient 
foundations within zone of influence of trees, 
permeable surfacing and SUDs drainage, wildlife 
connectivity such as hedges for boundary 
treatment and hedgehog gaps when fencing is 
used, underground services and infrastructure in 
relation to root protection areas of existing trees 
and new tree planting areas, security and access 
arrangements to landscaped areas.
10.33 Arboriculture Surveys should be undertaken 
separately and help to inform the Landscape 
Design Strategy, where one is required. Surveys 
should provide details of existing species (with 
information on spread, roots and position 
of trees), details of trees affected by the 
development (including measures to be taken to 
protect retained trees during the construction 
process), and other plans for the positive 
management of trees. Plans and documents will 
be expected to be submitted in accordance with 
the British Standards 5837 (2012).

10 GREEN INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
10.34 Allotments and community gardens form part of 
the Borough’s network of green infrastructure. 
They are an important resource for local food 
production, support biodiversity and promote 
sustainable communities, for example, by 
providing opportunities for recreation and 
social interaction. For children and young 
people food growing offers opportunities for 
education outside of the traditional classroom 
setting. Allotments and community gardens are 
invaluable to those who do not have access to 
a private garden and therefore help to promote 
more inclusive communities. Whilst recognising 
that private gardens provide opportunities for 
food growing, this policy does not apply to 
gardens as these are dealt with separately in the 
Local Plan.
10.35 All major development proposals for residential 
and community uses are encouraged to 
incorporate provision for food growing. This 
should be considered early in the design-led 
approach so that provision is of a high quality, 
suitably meets the needs of the intended end 
users, and is accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. Consideration should also be given to 
the integration of ancillary facilities, such as 
storage space for equipment and connections to 
water sources, which are vital to ensuring that 
provision is convenient and functional.Grow Mayow Community Garden
346GR7 Geodiversity 
A The Council will protect the Borough’s 
geodiversity assets and seek to promote 
understanding of them by:
a. Designating a Regionally Important 
Geological Site at Beckenham Place Park; 
b. Designating  Locally Important Geological 
Sites at Old Gravel Pit, Blackheath and 
Buckthorne Cutting, Crofton Park; and
c. Ensuring development proposals make a 
positive contribution to the protection and 
enhancement of designated geodiversity 
sites and other sites of geological interest.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
10 GREEN INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
10.36 Geodiversity involves the many components that 
make up the landscape and its character. This 
includes physical features, such as rocks and 
soils, as well as the processes that help shape 
landforms such as erosion and sedimentation. An 
awareness of geodiversity helps us to understand 
our environment and how we can better adapt 
to it. As geodiversity is a natural resource that 
cannot be replaced or recreated it is important 
that geological interests are appropriately 
managed.
10.37 The Local Plan designates 3 geological sites 
of strategic importance which are set out 
in the Policies Map. The designations have 
been informed by research prepared by the 
Natural England and the London Geodiversity 
Partnership110, which supports the London Plan 
and its associated Supplementary Planning 
Guidance. The designated sites comprise:
• Regionally Important Geological Site (RIGS) at 
Beckenham Place Park. This RIGS consists of a 
small portion of land near the park’s entrance 
which is notable for its natural exposures of clay 
and sands, known as the Harwich Foundation. 
The exposure benefits from its location at either 
side of a Green Chain walk within the park where 
there is good opportunity for public access. • Locally Important Geological Site (LIGS) at Old 
Gravel Pit, Blackheath. This LIGS is located at the 
edge of an open space and features sand and 
gravel, also from the Harwich Foundation, which 
are visible despite being overgrown by grass.
• Locally Important Geological Site at Buckthorne 
Cutting, Crofton Park. This LIGS is located at a 
railway cutting and features clay, silt and sand 
from the London Clay Formation. The site forms 
part of a Local Nature Reserve where there are 
opportunities for public access. 
10.38 We will protect the geodiversity interests 
at these sites and promote appreciation 
and understanding of them, such as by 
supporting way finding signs, interpretative 
boards and public access improvements where 
appropriate. The London’s Foundations SPG 
and associated research should be referred for 
further information on site characteristics and 
promotional opportunities.

have been identified as sites of geological 
interest but which have not been designated as 
RIGS or LIGS in the Local Plan. These include, for 
example, the New Cross Cutting Nature Reserve 
and at Ladywell. The Council will continue to 
work with stakeholders including the London 
Geodiversity Partnership to explore opportunities 
to support the protection and management of 
such sites.

A Lewisham Council has declared a climate 
emergency. In response to this a strategic and 
coordinated approach will be taken to ensure 
that the Borough contributes significantly 
to mitigating climate change and is made 
more resilient to its environmental, social and 
economic impacts. Local actions are both 
necessary and integral to supporting wider 
regional and national actions to address global 
climate change.
B To help ensure that the Borough develops in 
a way that is environmentally sustainable all 
development proposals must:
a. Help Lewisham to become a net zero-
carbon Borough as part of a net zero-carbon 
London; 
b. Protect and maximise opportunities to 
enhance the network of green and open 
spaces, as well as improve linkages to and 
between them;
c. Conserve sites of importance for biodiversity, 
protect habitats and species within the local 
ecological network, and deliver biodiversity 
net gain;
d. Implement measures to reduce flood risk 
and ensure resilience against the impact of 
flooding, and seek to improve the quality of 
water bodies;
e. Not adversely impact on the amenity of the 
local population and habitats; and
f. Help London to achieve waste net self-
sufficiency by  applying the waste hierarchy 
and circular economy principles.C A plan, manage and monitor approach will 
be used to support the successful transition 
to a net zero-carbon Borough. This approach 
will help to ensure that the Local Plan reflects

requirements and standards for carbon 
management, along with the Council’s latest 
technical studies and strategies to deliver low 
and zero carbon outcomes.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
11.1 Lewisham Council is one of the first local 
authorities in the UK to declare a climate 
emergency111. This declaration has been made 
recognising that a changing climate will have 
severe and enduring social, economic and 
environmental implications, and that tackling 
climate change is an issue of inequality as the 
greatest impact will be on the most vulnerable 
and those least able to protect themselves. A 
strategic and coordinated approach to addressing 
climate change is necessary. Collaborative action 
will need to be pursued by authorities at different 
levels and across administrative boundaries 
– in London, the UK and beyond – in order 
to realise significant positive gains in carbon 
reduction and to limit global warming112.  At 
the same time it is imperative that Lewisham’s 
neighbourhoods and communities are made 
more resilient to the on-going effects of climate 
change. We are committed to accelerating action 
on climate change understanding that locally 
specific responses are urgently needed to help 
address this global issue in a meaningful way, 
and that local authorities will need to show more 
leadership in this regard. The Local Plan will work 
together with the Council’s Climate Emergency 
Action Plan (2020), which sets out a roadmap for 
taking action on climate change in Lewisham.11.2 The Local Plan will play an important role in 
helping the Borough respond to the climate 
emergency. It provides the strategic framework 
for climate change mitigation and adaption in 
respect of the future use and management of 
land within Lewisham. It also sets out policies 
to ensure that new development is designed, 
constructed and operated in a sustainable way. 
These policies cut across a number of topic areas, 
many of which are included in the following 
section, and reflect the complexity of matters 
that must be taken into account when planning 
positively for climate change resilience.
11.3 The London Plan sets a strategic objective 
for London to become a net zero-carbon city 
by 2050, which we are committed to helping 
achieve. A plan, manage and monitor approach 
will be used to support the successful transition 
to a net zero-carbon Borough. We will regularly 
assess performance against our strategic 
objectives through the Authority Monitoring 
Report process. This will help to inform any 
necessary changes to the policy approaches set 
out in this Local Plan. In addition, we will take 
the opportunity to regularly review policies to 
ensure they reflect the latest requirements and 
standards at the regional and national levels, also 
taking account of the Council’s latest technical 
evidence and strategies.

112  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (FCCC), Decision 1/CP.21, more commonly referred 
to as the Paris Agreement, seeks to limit global warming to

354SD2 Sustainable design and retrofitting
A Development proposals must submit a 
Sustainable Design Statement. This should 
clearly set out how the design-led approach 
has been used to ensure the integration 
of sustainable design principles, including 
consideration of the construction and 
operation phases of development. The 
statement should be proportionate to the 
nature and scale of development proposed 
with a sufficient level of detail to demonstrate 
that the relevant policy requirements have 
been satisfied. For major development 
proposals the Sustainable Design Statement 
should refer and complement other detailed 
statements including for:
a. Landscape design and urban greening;
b. Nature conservation;
c. Energy use and heat risk management;
d. Air quality;
e. Flood risk and water management;
f. Ground conditions; and
g. Waste reduction and the circular economy.
B Proposals for new self-contained major and 
minor residential development should seek to 
achieve the BRE Home Quality Mark.
C Proposals for new non-residential 
development of 500 square metres gross 
floorspace or more, including mixed-use 
development, must achieve an ‘Excellent’ 
rating under the BREEAM New Construction 
(Non-Domestic Buildings) 2018 scheme, 
or future equivalent, unless it can be 
demonstrated that this is not feasible.Sustainable retrofitting
D The use of sustainable retrofitting measures 
will be encouraged and supported in order 
to improve the energy efficiency and 
environmental performance of housing and 
other buildings, as well as the quality of 
living spaces for their occupants. Retrofitting 
measures should be integrated using the 
‘whole house’ or ‘whole building’ approach, 
which requires an understanding of how a 
building has been constructed, its context and 
all the factors affecting energy use. 
E Development proposals for major residential 
domestic refurbishment must achieve 
a certified ‘Excellent’ rating under the 
BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment 2014 
scheme, or future equivalent, unless it can be 
demonstrated that this is not feasible.
F Development proposals for major non-
residential refurbishment, including mixed-
use development, will be required to achieve 
a certified ‘Excellent’ rating under the 
BREEAM Non-Domestic Refurbishment 
scheme, or future equivalent, unless it can be 
demonstrated that this is not feasible.
G Where planning consent is required, 
sustainable retrofitting measures to existing 
buildings and other development will only be 
supported where other Local Plan policies are 
satisfied, including on the historic environment 
and heritage assets.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
11.4 A significant step change in the design quality 
and environmental performance of buildings 
and spaces is needed to achieve the Local Plan’s 
strategic objectives, particularly for climate 
change adaptation and mitigation. Sustainable 
design principles should therefore be considered 
early in the planning and design stages and be 
fully integrated throughout the development 
process, including the construction and 
occupation stages. The principles cut across a 
number of topic areas within the Local Plan but 
are most predominant in the policies included 
in this section. All applicants must submit a 
Sustainable Design Statement explaining how the 
proposed development positively engages with 
these principles.  The statement should clearly 
identify the need for any site-specific mitigation 
and demonstrate that adequate measures will be 
delivered and effectively implemented.
11.5 The Home Quality Mark is a nationally 
recognised standard for new housing that has 
been established by the Building Research 
Establishment. It provides an indication of the 
expected health and well-being benefits and 
environmental footprint of new residential 
development. All proposals for new self-
contained residential development should seek to 
achieve the Home Quality Mark, as demonstrated 
through an independent assessment by a 
qualified assessor. Proposals are strongly 
recommended to achieve a minimum 3 star 
rating and for developers and/or agents to make 
the Home Quality Mark assessment publicly 
available, for example, as part of any promotional 
material. Published ratings will also assist the 
Council with monitoring implementation of the 
Local Plan policies.11.6 Proposals for new non-residential development 
(including refurbishments) and non-self-
contained housing will be expected to meet the 
Building Research Establishment Environmental 
Assessment Methodology (BREEAM) ‘Excellent’ 
standard. BREEAM provides a nationally 
recognised sustainable design standard for 
different types of development and covers a 
wide range of sustainability considerations. 
Applications for qualifying development are 
encouraged to submit BREEAM pre-assessments 
as part of the Sustainable Design Statement, 
identifying the credits to be targeted and 
measures to achieve these. All proposals will 
be considered having regard to individual site 
circumstances and the nature of development 
proposed. Planning contributions, such as 
carbon offsetting, may be sought where where 
it is suitably demonstrated that the policy 
requirements cannot be sufficiently satisfied such 
as for reasons of technical feasibility.
11.7 For commercial and industrial uses applicants 
must justify that the required ‘Excellent’ 
rating cannot be reasonably delivered on-site, 
including through evidence of a BREEAM pre-
assessment. It is recognised that for some types 
of developments the BREEAM requirements 
may pose particular challenges, for example, 
where there is no defined end-user and/or 
the Council has agreed that buildings require a 
certain level of fit out. However, our expectation 
is that shell only and shell and core proposals, 
where appropriate, should be capable of meeting 
the BREEAM credits taking into account the 
flexibility provided by the BREEAM methodology.
35611.8 Where the Home Quality Mark or BREEAM 
assessments are submitted, these must be 
prepared by a suitably qualified and independent 
assessor.
Sustainable retrofitting
11.9 Housing is the single largest contributor of 
carbon emissions in Lewisham, with more than 
50 per cent of emissions coming from energy 
used within homes113.   Sustainable retrofitting 
measures can help to improve the energy 
performance of existing buildings and minimise 
carbon emissions produced in the Borough. Even 
small-scale development, such as householder 
schemes, can incorporate measures that improve 
the environmental performance of buildings. 
This may include internal roof, floor and wall 
insulation, energy efficient fixtures, or urban 
greening. 
11.10 The most appropriate type of sustainable 
retrofitting measures will vary depending on 
the type of building, its context and location, 
including character setting. A ‘whole house’ 
or ‘whole building’ approach is one that looks 
at the energy performance of a building in a 
comprehensive and integrated way. It helps to 
ensure that improvements are carried out in 
an organised, sensible order, with installations 
and refit measures complementing rather 
than working against each other. For instance, 
some standard retrofitting measures can cause 
damage to traditional or historic buildings, 
causing problems with trapped moisture which 
may reduce energy efficiency and bring risks to the health of occupants. In addition, the 
budget available to householders and other 
developers will impact on the type and amount 
of retrofitting works they are able to carry out. 
The whole house approach can be useful to 
inform the most appropriate and cost-effective 
measures, along with phasing of works delivered 
over a longer period. Householders and other 
developers are encouraged to refer good practice 
guidance when considering retrofitting, such as 
the Climate Emergency Retrofit Guide published 
by the London Energy Transformation Initiative 
(LETI).
11.11 It is important retrofitting of historic buildings 
is carried out in a way  does no harm to the 
significance of heritage assets or their setting  
in line with other Local Plan policies. Where 
heritage assets are concerned, applicants are 
encouraged to refer to the latest Historic England 
guidance on energy efficiency and retrofit to 
inform their proposals.

SD3 Minimising greenhouse gas emissions
A To help Lewisham to become a net zero-
carbon Borough development proposals 
must be designed to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions in operation and minimise energy 
demand (annual and peak) in accordance with 
the London Plan energy hierarchy.
B Major development proposals must be net 
zero-carbon and:
a. Meet the minimum on-site reduction of 
carbon emissions required by the London 
Plan; and
b. Calculate and minimise emissions from 
any part of the development that are not 
covered by Building Regulations (e.g. 
unregulated emissions).
C Where it is clearly demonstrated that the 
net zero-carbon target cannot be achieved 
on-site, development proposals must make 
contributions to meet the identified shortfall 
through:
a. A cash-in-lieu contribution to Lewisham’s 
carbon offset fund; and/or
b. Appropriate off-site measures where these 
can be demonstrated to be deliverable.D Major development proposals are encouraged 
to assess embodied carbon emissions and 
maximise opportunities to reduce these 
emissions.
E Details of the approach used to meet the net 
zero-carbon target must be clearly set out in 
an Energy Strategy submitted as part of the 
Sustainable Design Statement. 
F Development proposals should minimise 
energy demand of the building(s) in-use 
by seeking to achieve the London Energy 
Transformation Initiative (LETI) targets for 
projected Energy Use Intensity (EUI), as set 
out in Table 11.1  
Table 11.1: Targets for Energy Use Intensity by 
Building Type114
114 All targets are set out in kilowatt hour (kWh) per metre 
square (m2) per year by Gross Internal Area (GIA) and 
excluding renewable energy contribution. The LETI Climate 
Emergency Design Guide should be referred for further 
information.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
11.12 The London Plan sets a strategic objective 
for London to become a zero-carbon city by 
2050. In order to contribute to meeting these 
objectives and help Lewisham become a net 
zero-carbon borough, it will be necessary for new 
development to maximise energy efficiency and 
reduce carbon emissions. A zero-carbon target 
for major residential developments has been in 
place for London (and Lewisham) since October 
2016 and this target now also applies to major 
non-residential developments. To meet the zero-
carbon target, the London Plan requires major 
developments to provide an on-site reduction of 
at least 35 per cent beyond the baseline of Part 
L of the Building Regulations 2013. Should the 
Building Regulations change, then the policy 
threshold will be subject to review and updating 
through the London Plan review process.
11.13 Embodied carbon refers to the greenhouse 
gas emissions arising from the manufacturing, 
transportation, installation, maintenance and 
disposal of building materials. This is distinguished 
from operational carbon which refers to emissions 
arising from building energy consumption. 
Operational carbon is dealt with by the London 
Plan and Policies SD3.A-C above. To help ensure 
that the carbon emissions are fully accounted 
and minimised during the development process, 
applicants are encouraged to assess and address 
embodied emissions through the design-led 
approach. Good practice guidance on this 
element of low carbon design should be referred, 
such as that prepared by the London Energy 
Transformation Initiative (LETI).
11.14 All new development proposals must be designed 
having regard to the London Plan energy hierarchy. 
New development is expected to be net-zero 
carbon and where this is not feasible, it should get as close as possible to zero-carbon on-site. 
Off-site contributions should be used as a last 
resort and will only be acceptable where it is 
clearly demonstrated that carbon targets cannot 
be fully achieved on-site. These contributions 
must address any identified shortfall and will be 
secured by planning obligations. Further details on 
carbon offset payments are set out in the Council’s 
Planning Obligations SPD. Carbon costing will be 
established in accordance with the London Plan 
and its associated guidance.
11.15 The LETI Climate Change Design Guide sets 
out a roadmap to zero carbon development. It 
recommends the use of an Energy Use Intensity 
(EUI) metric. The EUI is an annual measure of the 
total energy consumed in a building. It is a good 
indicator for building performance as the metric 
is solely dependent on how the building performs 
in-use; rather than carbon emissions, which also 
reflect the carbon intensity of the grid. EUI can be 
estimated at the design stage and easily monitored 
in-use as energy bills are based on kilowatt hour 
(kWh) of energy used by the building. EUI includes 
all of the energy consumed in the building such 
as regulated energy (heating, hot water, cooling, 
ventilation, and lighting) and unregulated energy 
(plug loads and equipment e.g. kitchen white 
goods, ICT/AV equipment). It does not include 
charging of electric vehicles. Development 
proposals should make reasonable efforts to 
reduce energy consumption of buildings in-use, 
including by reducing space heating demand. 
Details should be set out in the Energy Statement, 
where appropriate. The EUI targets in Table 11.1  
are non-binding and should be used as a guide to 
help future-proof development, until such time 
EUI targets may be set out in higher level policy or 
Building Regulations.
360SD4 Energy infrastructure
A Development proposals must be designed in 
response to a site-specific assessment of the 
most effective and efficient energy supply 
options, taking into account the Council’s Energy 
Masterplan. For large-scale schemes such as major 
developments, applicants should engage at an 
early stage with the relevant energy suppliers 
and bodies to establish future energy and 
infrastructure requirements necessary to support 
the development.
B Development proposals should prioritise 
connection to decentralised heat networks. 
Major development proposals must provide a 
Feasibility Assessment for connecting to, and if 
possible extending or interconnecting, existing 
or planned future heat networks located on or in 
proximity to the site. Proposals for minor new-build 
development, conversions and building alterations 
must demonstrate that they have investigated and 
maximised opportunities to connect to existing 
heat networks.
C Where a decentralised heat network is planned or 
likely to be delivered in the future, development 
proposals should be designed to enable a cost-
effective connection to it, having regard to Heat 
Network Priority Areas of the London Heat Map 
and energy masterplans.
D Major development proposals within Heat Network 
Priority Areas should have a communal low-
temperature heating system. The heat source must 
be selected in accordance with the London Plan 
heating hierarchy E Development proposals for CHP and ultra-low NOx 
gas boiler communal or district heating systems will 
only be acceptable where it is demonstrated that 
other options in the heating hierarchy have been 
fully investigated and are not feasible, and there 
will be no adverse impact on air quality. Air Quality 
Assessments must include full dispersion modelling 
to assess impacts on nearby receptors.
F Where CHP and ultra-low NOx gas boiler systems 
are acceptable in line with (E) above, proposals 
should be designed in a way that enables, and does 
not preclude, the decarbonisation of the site wide 
communal network in the future.
G Major housing development proposals must, and all 
minor housing proposals should, submit an estimated 
heat unit supply price (£/kWh), annual standing 
charges and projected annual maintenance costs 
for their proposed Energy Strategy. This should 
include information detailing any assumptions 
the calculations are based on. Where it can be 
suitably demonstrated that other Local Plan policy 
requirements can be satisfied without the submission 
of this information at the planning application 
stage, the Council will seek to secure this through 
planning obligations or through Building Control 
arrangements.
H Where site-wide communal and district heating 
systems are operational, heat and energy service 
providers are encouraged to enter into customer 
charters with domestic and small business customers.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREFigure 11.1: Lewisham heat map - Tier 1 and 2 heat loads
362Explanation
11.16 In order for Lewisham to become a net zero-
carbon Borough it will be necessary to change 
the way in which energy is used and supplied. 
This means shifting from a reliance on natural 
gas as the main energy source to a wider 
range of low and zero-carbon and renewable 
sources. Decentralised energy covers a range 
of technologies that do not rely directly on the 
electricity transmission network or gas grid. It is 
expected to play an increasingly important role 
in London’s energy supply. Decentralised energy 
is vital to energy security and helping the Capital 
become more energy self-sufficient. It also offers 
opportunities for carbon reduction as a more 
sustainable energy source. 
11.17 Development proposals should prioritise 
connection to decentralised heat networks 
wherever technically feasible. The London Plan 
identifies Heat Network Priority Areas where 
there are opportunities to facilitate decentralised 
energy network development. These areas 
feature heat densities that are sufficient for heat 
networks to provide an economically competitive 
option for supplying energy. They include parts 
of Lewisham and areas in adjoining Boroughs. 
Applicants are encouraged to refer the London 
Heat Map for the latest information on heat 
demands, supplies and networks across London 
along with the extent of Heat Network Priority 
Areas. 11.18 The Council has prepared studies to support 
decentralised energy network development in 
the Borough. This includes the Lewisham Energy 
Masterplan (2020) and Strategic Borough-wide 
Decarbonisation Study (2020). All development 
proposals should refer to the Council’s latest 
energy masterplans and studies  to ensure 
that opportunities for decentralised energy are 
maximised. 
11.19 All proposals for major residential and commercial 
development must submit a Feasibility 
Assessment to fully evaluate connecting to 
an existing or planned future heat network. 
The assessment should evaluate technical and 
financial viability and consider a range of factors 
included but not restricted to: capability of the 
network to supply part of the heat demand, 
location of development and distance to network 
pipes, physical barriers and other developments 
in the areas that may also be required to connect. 
For the purpose of this policy, a planned future 
network is one that is considered by the Council 
likely to be operational within 3 years of the 
grant of planning permission. All proposals for 
minor new-build development, extensions and 
alterations should also seek to secure connection 
to heat networks. Major development proposals 
must include an Energy Statement as part of 
the Sustainable Design Statement. This should 
provide sufficient information to demonstrate 
that feasibility has been fully investigated, having 
regard to the latest London Plan Supplementary 
Planning Guidance. Consideration of feasibility 
should take into account potential connections to 
networks both within and outside the Borough. 
363
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTURE11.20 In areas where there are no existing or planned 
district heat networks proposals should be 
designed for future connection to a heat 
network. The latest London Heat Manual should 
be referred for further guidance. Designs should 
entail a wet heating system, single point of 
connection into heating system, additional 
plant room space for thermal substation and 
low temperature heating systems (60 degrees 
Celsius or lower) to support low temperature heat 
networks  This will help to ensure that connection 
is made more financially viable and technically 
feasible in future years.
11.21 All major development proposals within 
Heat Network Priority Areas should have 
a communal heating system served from a 
single energy centre, with the heat source for 
the system selected in accordance with the 
heating hierarchy. Proposals will be expected to 
demonstrate that the feasibility and viability of 
implementing options at the higher end of the 
hierarchy have been fully investigated before 
considering the use of CHP or gas boiler systems. 
We will refuse proposals that rely on CHP or gas 
boiler systems where their use is not sufficiently 
justified. Where the use of an ultra-low NOx is 
justified, this should achieve an emissions rating 
of <40 mg/kWh. Furthermore, all such proposals 
must not result in any adverse impact on air 
quality, in line with other  Local Plan policies.11.22 Where development proposals including CHP 
and ultra-low NOx gas boiler systems are 
acceptable in principle, they should be designed 
in a way that enables, and does not preclude, 
the decarbonisation of the site wide communal 
network in the future. Proposals should include 
information on the opportunities and potential 
measures in this respect. This could include, for 
example, details describing how the development 
could accommodate the plant space required for 
such decentralised energy networks, and how 
the individual dwellings have been designed to 
enable future connections.
11.23 Heat networks and communal heating systems 
must be designed, constructed, commissioned 
and operated in accordance with CIBSE/
ABE Code of Practice CP1 or equivalent. All 
developments that are required to connect to an 
existing or planned heat network in accordance 
with policy must demonstrate in the Energy 
Strategy how the scheme will comply with the 
above Code of Practice.
36411.24 Where households and businesses are reliant on 
decentralised heat networks it is important that 
there are clear expectations for service standards. 
We will encourage the use of customer charters 
or publically available right of challenge in a 
fair and independent way. Such charters and 
ombudsman are useful in establishing clarity on 
matters such as system maintenance and end-
user pricing, and can be particularly helpful to 
more vulnerable uses (for example, those in or 
at risk of fuel poverty or start-up and micro-
businesses). All developments that are required 
to connect to an existing or planned heat 
network in accordance with this policy should 
ensure that the future network operator will be 
registered with the Heat Trust Scheme (Heat 
Customer Protection Ltd.) The scheme sets 
out common customer service standards and 
protection requirements that are comparative 
to regulated utilities, drawing on legislation and 
good practice guidance.

367
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
11.25 In recent years London has experienced higher 
than historic average temperatures along 
with more severe hot weather events. Heat 
risk is becoming an increasingly important 
issue, particularly in the context of a growing 
population and global climate change. The urban 
heat island is experienced in areas where there 
is extensive urban development. Buildings and 
spaces in these areas absorb and retain heat 
during the day and night. In a heavily urbanised 
place like London, this process results in the 
city being several degrees warmer than its 
surrounding areas. The urban heat island poses 
a significant health risk to vulnerable groups, 
such as older people or those with certain health 
conditions, particularly during peak summer 
months. All new development must therefore 
use the design-led approach to minimise internal 
heat gain and manage heat risk in line with the 
London Plan cooling hierarchy
11.26 Applicants should refer the latest Chartered 
Institution of Building Services Engineers 
(CIBSE) guidance on assessing and mitigating 
overheating risk in new developments, including 
TM59 for domestic development and TM52 
for non-domestic development. The London 
Mayor’s Energy Planning Guidance should also 
be referred. Proposals should undertake dynamic 
thermal modelling to ensure that development 
does not overheat, and this should address 
temperatures likely to be experienced over the 
lifetime of the development, having regard 
to CIBSE guidance and datasets included in 
document TM49.11.27 Severe hot weather events can discourage 
physical and outdoor activity. Development 
proposals must therefore be designed to provide 
for a comfortable environment. This may include 
shaded areas integrated into the public realm  or 
measures to ensure indoor amenity spaces are 
cool and well-ventilated. Planning contributions 
for cooling measures outside the site boundary 
may be necessary to mitigate heat risk generated 
by the development, for example, to make the 
public realm more comfortable, in line with the 
Healthy Streets Approach.
11.28 All major development proposals must submit 
an Energy Statement as part of the Sustainable 
Design Statement. This should clearly set out 
how measures at the higher end of the cooling 
hierarchy have been considered and given 
priority through the design-led approach. We will 
refuse proposals that use measures at the lower 
levels of the hierarchy unless there is evidence to 
demonstrate that this is necessary, for example, 
for reasons of technical feasibility.
11.29 It is recognised that the feasibility of measures 
in the cooling hierarchy will often depend on 
the nature and scale of development. Minor 
developments such as householder extensions 
may have limited scope to implement measures 
at the higher end of the hierarchy. The urban 
heat island effect can be mitigated through 
the cumulative positive impacts of smaller 
developments. For this reason, the loss of 
established soft landscape features without 
replacement will be resisted for all proposals 
and new soft landscaping will be encouraged 
wherever possible.
368SD6 Improving air quality
A Poor air quality is a significant public health 
issue in Lewisham. All new development must 
use the design-led approach and integrate 
on-site measures to improve air quality 
and prevent or minimise the population’s 
exposure to poor air quality, having regard to 
Lewisham’s Air Quality Management Plan.
B Development proposals must:
a. Seek to improve air quality and be at least 
air quality neutral; 
b. Not lead to a further deterioration of 
existing poor air quality;
c. Not create any new areas that exceed air 
quality limits, or delay the date at which 
compliance will be achieved in areas that are 
currently in exceedance of legal limits; and
d. Not create unacceptable risk of high levels 
of exposure to poor air quality.
C Air Quality Assessments must be submitted 
with proposals for:
a. Major development;
b. Minor development within an Air Quality 
Management Area and/or Air Quality 
Focus Area if the development is likely to 
adversely impact on air quality or introduce 
new sensitive receptors to exposure to an 
area of existing poor air quality; and
c. Community infrastructure  or other uses 
(including public open space) that are likely 
to be used by large numbers of particularly 
vulnerable groups, such as older people and 
children and young people.D Development proposals must demonstrate how 
they will comply with the Non-Road Mobile 
Machinery Low Emission Zone requirements 
and reduce emissions from the demolition 
and construction of buildings following the 
Mayor’s ‘The Control of Dust and Emissions 
for Construction and Demolition’ SPG, or 
subsequent guidance.
E Development proposals will be considered 
having regard to their individual and 
cumulative impacts on air quality. Proposals 
that do not meet the requirements of (A) 
and (B) above will be refused unless it can 
be suitably demonstrated that adverse 
impacts can be mitigated to an acceptable 
level. Mitigation should be provided on-
site. In exceptional circumstances where it is 
demonstrated that on-site mitigation is not 
feasible, off-site provision may be acceptable 
where equivalent air quality benefits will 
be delivered in the area affected by the 
development.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREFigure 11.2: Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) and Air Quality Focus Areas (AQFAs)
370Explanation
11.30 Air quality is a significant public health issue in 
Lewisham and across London. The link between 
air quality and public health outcomes is well 
documented. Air pollution is estimated to reduce 
life expectancy of every person in the UK by 
an average of 7 to 8 months and in Lewisham, 
the proportion of all-cause adult mortality 
attributable to air pollution is 6.5 per cent, which 
is higher than the national average.  This policy 
supports the London Mayor’s commitment to 
making air quality in London the best of any 
major world city. It also helps give effect to the 
NPPF which sets out that local plans should 
sustain and contribute towards compliance with 
the relevant limit values or national objectives for 
pollutants, taking into account the presence of 
Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) and Air 
Quality Focus Areas (AQFAs).
11.31 There are currently 6 AQMAs in Lewisham with 
two major AQMAs. These cover all the areas 
north of the A205 (South Circular) together with 
major roads in the south. The AQMAs have been 
declared for several pollutants.. An assessment of 
air quality in Lewisham has shown a decreasing 
trend in the levels of two pollutants, nitrogen 
dioxide (NO²) and particulate matter (PM) in 
recent years. However more needs to be done 
to meet the guidelines set out by the World Health Organisation. In Lewisham, the highest 
concentrations of nitrogen/nitric oxides (NOx), 
NO² and PM which breach the legal limits are 
found on the busiest main roads. However, 
pollution levels quickly reduce with distance from 
the pollution source116.  
11.32 In addition to AQMAs there are also 10 Air 
Quality Focus Areas (AQFAs) in the Borough. 
These are locations that have been identified 
as having high levels of pollution and human 
exposure. The current AQMAs and the Mayor’s 
‘London Datastore’ maintains an up-to-date 
list of AQFAs across the Capital, taking account 
of changing circumstances and latest available 
evidence. AQMAs are identified in Figure 11.2  
and may be subject to periodic review and 
updating. Development proposals within AQFAs 
must submit a desktop Health Impact Assessment 
in line with Policy DM5 (Health Impact 
Assessments).

Picture of Lewisham. 2019.116  Draft Lewisham Air Quality Management Action 
Plan 2022-2027 (2021). Lewisham AQMA declared in 
2001 for exceedances in annual mean NO² and 24-hour 
mean PM10 concentrations and Crofton Park and Honor 
Oak Park AQMA declared in 2013 for exceedances in 
annual mean NO² concentrations. It is also important that 
development proposals consider PM2.5 which are smaller 
particles than PM10 , in line with the Mayor of London 
target to align with the WHO guidelines.
371
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTURE11.33 New  development must be at least ‘air quality 
neutral’ and not lead to a further deterioration 
of existing poor air quality, in line with the 
London Plan. Development proposals must also 
reduce the population’s exposure to poor air 
quality, particularly for those groups who are 
most vulnerable to its impacts such as children 
and young people and older people. New 
development, as a minimum, must not cause 
new exceedances of legal air quality standards 
or compromise achievement of compliance 
in those areas currently in exceedance, as 
currently provided by the Air Quality Standards 
Regulations 2010. The Healthy Streets Approach 
should be used wherever possible to help address 
poor air quality. Development proposals will be 
considered taking into account individual and 
cumulative impacts of development in an area, 
consistent with national policy. 
11.34 Applicants should refer to the London Plan 
guidance for further information on the 
Air Quality Neutral and Air Quality Positive 
standards. The Council’s latest Air Quality 
Action Plan and associated monitoring reports 
should also be referred, along with our Good 
Practice Guide: Control of Pollution and Noise 
from Demolition and Construction. Sites. In 
addition, development proposals on or adjacent 
to waterways should refer to the Port of London 
Authority’s Air Quality Strategy.
11.35 Air Quality Assessments (AQAs) will be required 
for qualifying development set out in the policy 
and must address impacts arising during the 
construction, occupation and operation phases 
of development. They should also consider the 
wider cumulative impacts on air quality arising 
from development within the locality. 11.36 Where an AQA indicates a potential negative 
impact on air quality, appropriate measures 
that will minimise or offset impacts from 
the development should be identified and 
implemented on-site. Planning permission will be 
refused unless appropriate mitigation measures 
are adopted to reduce the impact to acceptable 
levels. In practice, it may not always be possible 
to achieve Air Quality Neutral standards or 
to acceptably minimise impacts using on-
site measures alone. If on-site measures are 
insufficient to make the development acceptable, 
the AQA should demonstrate that it is possible to 
include measures in the local area with equivalent 
air quality benefits. Mitigation measures may 
be secured either by planning condition or legal 
agreement, where appropriate.
11.37 An AQA with full dispersion modelling is required 
for all proposed Biomass and CHP boilers and 
this must demonstrate that the impact on nearby 
receptors is minimal.
11.38 Development that involves significant 
demolition, construction or earthworks will be 
required to assess the risk of impacts according 
to the Institute of Air Quality Management 
Dust Guidance and the London Mayor’s SPG 
on ‘The Control of dust and Emissions during 
Construction and Demolition’. Mitigation 
measures should be included in the Construction 
Management Plan. All medium and high risk 
sites should include real time construction 
dust monitoring, in line with the London Plan 
guidance.
372SD7 Minimising and managing flood risk
A The Council will work in partnership with 
stakeholders to implement the Thames Estuary 
2100 Plan. To minimise and manage flood risk 
development proposals must:
a. Apply a sequential approach to the location 
of new development to avoid flood risk to 
the population and property whilst taking 
account of the long-term impact of climate 
change,
b. Not increase flood risk and reduce the risk 
of flooding from all sources;
c. Make space for water by providing an 
undeveloped setback from rivers and other 
watercourses; 
d. Where appropriate, carry out a condition 
survey of flood defence and other 
watercourse infrastructure and if necessary, 
provide for maintenance, repairs or 
remediation to secure its functional integrity 
over the lifetime of the development. This 
includes raising the Thames Tidal Defences 
in accordance with the TE2100 plan, in the 
case of riparian ownership of land; and
e. Be designed to remain safe and operational 
under flood conditions. 
B A site specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) 
will be required for all development proposals 
within Flood Zone 2, 3a and 3b, all major 
development in Flood Zone 1, and elsewhere 
in the Borough where development may be 
at risk of other sources of flooding. The FRA 
must provide sufficient information for the 
Council to assess whether the requirements of 
the Sequential and Exception Tests have been 
satisfied. The FRA must:a. Be proportionate with the degree of flood risk 
posed both to and by the development;
b. Take account of all potential sources of 
flooding both on and off-site;
c. Make an appropriate allowance for the hazard 
posed by climate change over the lifetime of 
the development; and
d. Have regard to the recommendations of the 
latest Lewisham SFRA and the Lewisham Local 
Flood Risk Management Strategy.
C Where development proposals satisfy the 
Sequential and Exception Tests they must be 
designed to should ensure that:
a. The most vulnerable land uses are directed 
to areas of the site that are at lowest risk of 
flooding;
b. There is no net loss of flood storage capacity 
and adequate provision is made for flood 
storage and compensation, with priority given 
to on-site provision;
c. There is no detrimental impact on the natural 
function of the floodplain and floodwater flow 
routes across the site; and
d. Appropriate mitigation measures are 
incorporated to address any residual flood risk, 
including safe access and egress for all likely 
users of the development.
D Development proposals must provide a site-
specific Flood Emergency Response Plan to 
manage actual and/or residual flood risk, where 
appropriate.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREFigure 11.3: Flood zones and Critical Drainage Areas
374Explanation
11.39 The water environment is a defining feature of 
Lewisham. The Borough fronts onto the River 
Thames and the river poses a potential risk of 
flooding, although the adjacent land area benefits 
from the River Thames Tidal Defences. Lewisham 
also falls within most of the catchment of the River 
Ravensbourne and its tributaries, including the 
Quaggy, the Pool and Kyd Brook, which outfalls 
into the River Thames at Deptford Creek. The Honor 
Oak Stream (Chudleigh Ditch), another tributary 
of the Ravensbourne, also passes through the 
Borough. Elsewhere there are localised areas that 
are at potential risk from other sources of flooding 
including through surface water run-off, ground 
water flooding, surcharge from the sewer network 
and the blockage of culverts and gullies.
11.40 The Thames Estuary 2100 Plan sets out actions 
that are needed to manage flood risk in the Thames 
Estuary taking account of the long-term impacts 
of climate change. It promotes a multi-agency 
approach including Government bodies, local 
authorities and developers. Lewisham is within 
‘Action Zone 2 – Central London’ of the Plan, where 
requirements include future raising of all tidal flood 
defences together with an ongoing programme of 
inspection, maintenance, repair and replacement 
of defences as required. Corridors of land alongside 
the existing defences should be safeguarded to 
provide space for these works and “make space for 
water” through increased riverside buffer zones of 
16 metres for tidal rivers and 8 metres for fluvial 
rivers, or other distance agreed by the Council 
and Environment Agency. Riparian landowners 
have a responsibility to maintain and raise tidal 
flood defences and follow the latest good practice 
guidance, such as the Estuary Edges guidance.11.41 New development must not increase flood risk to 
people and properties. Development proposals 
should proactively seek to minimise and mitigate 
flood risk by considering risk from all sources using 
appropriate and up-to-date information. Early 
engagement with relevant stakeholders, including 
the Council as Lead Local Flood Authority, the 
Environment Agency (EA), Thames Water Utilities 
and Port of London Authority is strongly advised.
11.42 The Council regularly reviews its Strategic Flood 
Risk Assessment (SFRA). The Level 1 SFRA (2019) 
maps the Borough into flood zones according to 
the probability of flooding occurring, discounting 
the presence of any flood defences and alleviation 
measures. Flood Zone 3b is the functional 
floodplain, where water has to flow or be stored 
in times of flood. Applicants should consult the 
EA for site specific flood model outputs to better 
understand flood risk, and to establish whether 
the flood zones in the SFRA have been updated. 
Lewisham’s Surface Water Management Plan 
(SWMP) provides information on other sources of 
flood risk. 
375
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTURE11.43 In line with the NPPF a sequential approach must 
be used to ensure that new development is directed 
to those areas of the Borough, and locations within 
sites, that are at the lowest risk of flooding. We 
will consider the appropriateness of development 
having regard to the Sequential and Exception 
Tests, and FRAs submitted by applicants. FRAs 
must take into account the long-term hazard 
posed by climate change. The latest standing 
advice on climate change allowances published 
by the EA should be referred and form the basis 
of assessments. The Lewisham Level 2 SFRA also 
provides site specific information (including flood 
depth, velocity, rates of inundation and duration 
of flooding). The NPPF states that the Exception 
Test may be satisfied where development provides 
wider sustainability benefits to the community that 
outweigh flood risk. This will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis however all such development 
must be demonstrably necessary to support 
the delivery of the spatial strategy, for example, 
community or other types of infrastructure.  
11.44 As part of the preparation of the Local Plan the 
Council has undertaken a Sequential Test to assist 
in identifying those areas of the Borough that are 
suitable for strategic sites. Allocated sites that have 
passed the Sequential Test will not need to apply 
this test again, unless the proposed use is not 
consistent with the site allocation. 11.45 Where the Sequential and Exception Tests are 
satisfied development proposals must fully 
investigate opportunities to avoid, reduce, manage 
and mitigate flood risk through site layout and 
development design. This includes appropriate 
measures to ensure development is safe. Proposals 
should fully assess and address residual risk, 
including through flood resistant design (e.g. 
to prevent water from entering the building and 
damaging its fabric) and resilient design (e.g. 
to ensure the building’s structural integrity is 
maintained and that drying and cleaning can be 
facilitated).
11.46 Development proposals must be accompanied by 
a Flood Emergency Response Plan to ensure safe 
access and egress from actual and/or residual 
flooding, where appropriate. This measure is 
necessary to ensure that building occupiers can 
be made aware of the responses to various types 
and scale of flood threat, evacuation logistics, 
evacuation routes and other safety arrangements in 
terms of dry access, egress and refuge.  Examples 
of such developments can include proposals with 
water compatible uses, alterations to existing 
buildings and building floor levels that have been 
raised, but where there is remaining flood risk under 
the 0.1% AEP event.
376SD8 Sustainable drainage
A Development proposals should be located 
and designed having regard to the London 
Sustainable Drainage Action Plan, the 
Council’s Surface Water Management Plan and 
Local Flood Risk Management Strategy;
B Development proposals must achieve 
greenfield runoff rates and ensure that 
surface water runoff is managed as close to 
its source as possible, in line with the London 
Plan drainage hierarchy. Proposals for major 
development and development in a Critical 
Drainage Area must submit a Drainage 
Strategy.
C Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) should 
be integrated into development wherever 
possible with priority given to green and 
blue over grey measures. All SuDS must 
meet the Department for Environment, Food 
and Rural Affairs Non-Statutory Technical 
Standards and be designed in accordance 
with the latest Construction Industry and 
Research Association (CIRIA) SuDS Manual 
or equivalent.  Development proposals 
must demonstrate that SuDS will function 
effectively over the lifetime of development.
D SuDS involving infiltration must not have an 
adverse impact on groundwater sources. Where 
infiltration is proposed, the Environment 
Agency should be consulted to consider the 
suitability of SuDS having regard to the impact 
of drainage into the groundwater aquifer. E Where it is clearly demonstrated that a 
greenfield runoff rate cannot be achieved or 
SuDS cannot be implemented due to reasons 
of feasibility, development proposals must:
a. Ensure that surface water runoff (both 
in terms of volume and flow) has been 
reduced as much as reasonably practical; 
and
b. Investigate and integrate measures to 
improve water quality.
F Development proposals should be designed 
to include permeable surfaces wherever 
possible. Proposals for impermeable surfacing, 
including on front gardens, driveways, and car 
parks, will be refused unless it can be suitably 
demonstrated that this is unavoidable.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
11.47 Surface water flooding occurs when high intensity 
rainfall generates runoff which flows and ponds 
in low-lying areas. It is generally associated with 
intense rain, saturated soils and an insufficient 
drainage capacity of the surface water system. 
Surface water flooding is an issue in London 
due to continued urban development (increased 
impermeable area) and climate change (greater 
rainfall intensity). Lewisham’s Surface Water 
Management Plan (SWMP) identifies 9 Critical 
Drainage Areas (CDAs) which are particularly 
susceptible to surface water flooding. The CDAs 
fall within much of Lewisham’s London Plan 
Opportunity Areas and are also widely present in 
southern part of the Borough.
11.48 New development must contribute to minimising 
and mitigating flood risk through the use of 
Sustainable Drainage Systems. SuDS involve 
management practices and techniques used to 
slow the rate of surface water runoff and improve 
infiltration by mimicking natural drainage. This 
reduces the risk of flash-flooding which occurs 
when rainwater rapidly flows into the public 
sewerage and drainage systems.
11.49 Development proposals should reduce flows 
to a greenfield runoff rate. This is the rate that 
reflects the natural rate of water runoff from an 
undeveloped, naturally permeable site. The volume 
of runoff must be stored on site and be calculated 
based on the nationally agreed return period value 
of a 1 in 100 year critical storm event, including an 
allowance for climate change.11.50 SuDs should be viewed as more than just a tool 
to manage surface water flooding. Where they 
are well designed and sensitively integrated into 
development, SuDS can enhance the attractiveness 
and amenity value of a site. They can also support 
biodiversity through the creation of habitats, such 
as ponds and wetlands, and by improving the 
quality of water discharges.
11.51 SuDS should be designed giving priority to 
‘green’ or ‘blue’ over ‘grey’ measures. This policy 
provides flexibility to implement a variety of SuDS 
measures, as the techniques used will depend on 
site characteristics and the nature of development 
proposed. Applicants must demonstrate that 
SuDS will function effectively over the lifetime 
of the development. A Drainage Strategy must 
accompany all major development proposals and 
other proposals within a CDA. This should include 
a SuDS Management Plan setting out long-term 
management and maintenance arrangements.
11.52 If it is suitably demonstrated that a greenfield 
runoff rate cannot be achieved, for example due to 
reasons of site condition (e.g. land contamination) 
or technical feasibility, development proposals must 
minimise runoff rates as far as reasonably practical 
and maximise measures to improve water quality.
378SD9 Lewisham’s waterways
A Waterways provide multifunctional social, 
economic and environmental benefits that 
support sustainable neighbourhoods and 
communities. Development proposals should 
identify and respond positively to the unique 
attributes of waterways, giving particular 
consideration to their:
a. Environmental function and ecological 
qualities;
b. Contribution to the Borough’s network of 
open spaces;
c. Recreational and amenity value; 
d. Distinctive features that help to shape and 
reinforce the Borough’s physical, cultural 
and historical character; 
e. Support for the visitor economy; and
f. Potential to facilitate water transport, for 
both passengers and freight.
B Development proposals on sites containing or 
adjacent to a main river, ordinary watercourse 
or other water space must:
a. Demonstrate how the objectives of the 
Thames River Basin Management Plan, 
Vision for the Tidal Thames, London River 
Restoration Action Plan, Marine Plan for 
the South East and other relevant local 
guidance, including the River Corridors 
Improvement Plan SPD and Ravensbourne 
Catchment Improvement Plan, have been 
taken into account, where appropriate;
b. Ensure that there is no adverse impact on 
the natural functioning of the watercourse, 
including by maintaining an undeveloped 
buffer zone with an adequate set back 
distance from the watercourse, as agreed 
with the Council and the Environment 
Agency;c. Investigate and maximise opportunities to 
enhance or restore river channels, flood 
flow pathways, floodplains and other 
natural flood management features with the 
objective of returning them to their natural 
state wherever possible;
d. Incorporate measures to enhance the 
ecological, amenity, recreational and 
historic value of water spaces, including by 
enhancing public access to these spaces; 
and
e. Contribute to a safe riverside environment 
by making appropriate provision for riparian 
life-saving equipment such as grab chains, 
access ladders, life buoys, along with 
information signage and CCTV.
C Development proposals should seek to 
improve water quality and must ensure that 
there is no deterioration in the quality of a 
watercourse or groundwater, in line with the 
European Water Framework Directive 2000.
D The Lewisham section of the Thames 
Policy Area is designated in the Local Plan, 
as reflected in the Policies Map. All new 
development within the Thames Policy Area 
will be expected to respond positively to the 
distinctive character and qualities of the River 
Thames and its surrounds, in line with Policy 
LNA 4 (Thames Policy Area and Deptford 
Creekside).

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREE Convoys Wharf is included within London’s 
network of safeguarded wharves. The 
Council will continue to safeguard Convoys 
Wharf taking into account the Ministerial 
safeguarding Direction for the wharf and 
extant planning consents. Development 
proposals involving water transport at 
Convoys Wharf will be supported where they 
comply with London Plan policy SI15 (Water 
transport), along with other relevant policies.
F Development proposals for water and marine 
based residential, commercial, community, 
recreational and transport uses (including 
moorings and jetties) alongside or within a 
waterway will only be supported where they:
a. Are demonstrably a water-dependent use; 
b. Are appropriately located and designed, 
taking into account the nature and scale of 
the proposed use;
c. Respond positively to, and do not adversely 
impact on, the open character, historic 
setting and views of the waterway, its 
frontage (including foreshore) and the 
surrounding area;
d. Do not have a detrimental impact on river 
navigation and flood defence infrastructure;
e. Do not have a detrimental impact on the 
environment, including water quality in line 
with (B) above;
f. Do not impede or compromise existing 
public access points to the waterway, 
and extend or enhance access wherever 
possible; and
g. Ensure adequate access and servicing 
arrangements for all intended users of the 
development.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
11.53 The term ‘waterways’ refers to the network of 
linked waterways in London – also known as the 
Blue Ribbon Network – which includes the River 
Thames, its tributaries, canals and other water 
spaces. Waterways are of strategic importance, 
particularly in Lewisham given its Thames-side 
location, and provide multifunctional benefits 
to the environment and local communities. The 
Lewisham Characterisation Study (2019) is helpful 
in explaining the significant role waterways 
have played in the Borough’s historical and 
cultural development, and the way in which they 
contribute to local character today. 
11.54 Development proposals must demonstrate 
how they have taken into account the Thames 
River Basin Management Plan and the London 
River Restoration Action Plan, particularly in 
contributing to the European Water Framework 
Directive (WFD) 2000 objectives. They should 
also refer to and engage positively with the River 
Corridors Improvement Plan SPD. The SPD sets 
out local guidance to support the delivery of 
high quality development along the Borough’s 
river corridors whilst balancing objectives 
for environmental protection and flood risk 
management.
11.55 Lewisham’s river corridors are heavily constrained 
by urban development along much of their 
respective lengths. The River Thames has been 
heavily modified over time with the growth of 
London, including the construction of raised 
defences along much of its width. Considerable 
modifications have also been made to other 
river channels in the Borough over the past 
decades including through canalising and 
culverting. The compromising of natural river 
processes can adversely impact on biodiversity 
and water quality. The Council has recently worked with the Environment Agency and other 
partners to deliver investment in river corridor 
improvements as part of its ongoing regeneration 
programme. This includes works along the Rivers 
Ravensbourne and Quaggy to provide improved 
defences and dedicated landscaped areas for 
flood storage, local amenity and improved 
biodiversity. These schemes have demonstrated 
that it is possible to put rivers back at the heart 
of new development and we aim to continue 
building on these successes.
11.56 In order to ensure there is no adverse impact 
of the natural functioning of a watercourse, 
or the integrity of a flood defence, all new 
development must maintain an undeveloped 
buffer zone with an adequate set back distance 
from the watercourse. A relief of 8 metres from 
a main river and 5 metres from an ordinary 
watercourse should be secured, unless otherwise 
agreed by the Council and the Environment 
Agency. Buffer zones should be left free of 
permanent structures, ensure adequate access 
for the maintenance of flood defences and be 
sensitively integrated into development in order 
to enhance their amenity value. Development 
within 20 metres of a bank of a main river will 
need Environment Agency consent. Some rivers 
have defined flood defence assets and proposals 
will be required to identify assets and these into 
consideration, where appropriate.
11.57 On sites with existing flood defence 
infrastructure we will seek to ensure that the 
functional integrity of this infrastructure is 
secured over the lifetime of the development. 
We may require proposals to include a Condition 
Survey of all existing infrastructure and if 
necessary, make provision for any necessary 
repairs or maintenance, to be secured through a 
382legal agreement or planning conditions. Culverts 
are considered flood defences and sites with 
existing culverts will be expected to investigate the 
feasibility of deculverting, with robust justification 
provided where this is not considered possible.
Water quality
11.58 The European Water Framework Directive 2000 
(WFD) provides the legal framework for the 
protection, improvement and sustainable use of 
waterbodies including rivers and groundwater. 
The improvement of waterbodies to ‘good’ 
ecological status or potential, and not allowing 
the deterioration in the status of waterbodies, 
are key requirements of the WFD. Applicants 
are encouraged to refer the Thames River Basin 
Management Plan for details of the quality of 
waterbodies in the Borough and throughout the 
basin district, along with measures needed to meet 
the WFD objectives for water quality. Proposals 
will be expected to investigate and maximise 
opportunities to integrate these measures.
Water infrastructure
11.59 There is a network of wharves along the River 
Thames that are protected for use as a wharf by a 
safeguarding Direction issued by the Secretary of 
State on 1st March 2021117.  
11.60 Development proposals at Convoys Wharf should 
support and enable appropriate waterborne and 
riverside uses, consistent with the safeguarding 
Direction, London Plan policy S15 (Water 
transport) and extant planning consents. The 
Council recognises and supports community 
aspirations for the Lenox Project. This involves the restoration of the Lenox, a state-of-the-art naval 
ship that was built in 1678 in Deptford and was 
the first of Charles II’s thirty ships. The project has 
significant potential for heritage-led regeneration 
in the Borough, and can help to promote the 
visitor economy as well as understanding of 
Lewisham’s historical and cultural development. 
Any such alternative uses proposed at the 
safeguarded wharf must robustly justify why the 
site is no longer viable or capable of being made 
viable for waterborne freight.
11.61  It is important that water infrastructure, including 
residential and commercial moorings, do not 
adversely impact on the Borough’s waterways. 
Where new development is proposed on, within or 
adjacent to a waterway, including the foreshore, 
applicants should consult with the relevant bodies 
including Environment Agency, Port of London 
Authority, Marine Management Organisation, 
the Canal and River Trust, and river catchment 
partnerships such as Your Tidal Thames. Early 
engagement will help to ensure that development 
is appropriate to its location and does not result 
in a detrimental impact on waterways, including 
on navigation, water quality, biodiversity, flood 
defences and local character. Proposals must 
demonstrate that there will be adequate access 
and servicing arrangements to support all 
intended users of the development, and that any 
new provision is sensitively located into the site 
and its surrounds. Development proposals that 
unnecessarily inhibit or detract from existing 
public access to waterways, or preclude future 
opportunities for enhanced access from being 
delivered will be refused. 
117 This refers to the safeguarding Direction issued by the 
Secretary of State for the former Department of Housing, 
Communities and Local Government, now Department for 
Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTURESD10 Water supply and wastewater
A Development proposals for new water supply 
and wastewater facilities or the expansion of 
existing facilities will be supported where the 
development:
a. Makes provision for infrastructure 
that is required within the Borough as 
demonstrated by an asset management or 
similar investment plan;
b. Will not result in an unacceptable adverse 
impact on the environment, human health, 
public safety, amenity and local character; 
and
c. Will be constructed in a timely and 
sustainable manner.  
B Development proposals should have regard 
to Drainage and Wastewater Management 
Plans (DWMPs) and must demonstrate that 
the local water supply and public sewerage 
networks have adequate capacity both on 
and off-site to serve demand arising from the 
development; or where such capacity does 
not exist and there are no programmed works, 
arrangements are made to ensure adequate 
provision prior to occupation. A Water Supply 
and/or Drainage Strategy may be required to 
demonstrate that suitable arrangements are in 
place to serve the development.C Development proposals should ensure the 
separation of surface and foul water systems, 
including by rectifying misconnections.  
Proposals should prioritise mains foul drainage 
and avoid the use of non-mains drainage 
for foul water disposal, particularly in Source 
Protection Zones. Where non-mains drainage 
is proposed for foul water the most sustainable 
drainage options must be implemented, as 
supported by a Drainage Strategy.
D Development proposals should be designed to 
be water efficient, reduce water consumption 
and minimise pressure on the combined sewer 
network by integrating SuDS and complying 
with the London Plan requirements for water 
efficiency. Planning conditions will be applied 
to ensure that water efficiency standards are 
met.
E Development proposals within a Source 
Protection Zone will only be supported 
where there is no risk of contamination to 
groundwater sources, or if a risk is identified, 
it is suitably demonstrated that adequate 
mitigation measures will be implemented.
F Development proposals for piled foundations 
must ensure that disturbances to the ground 
will not lead to adverse impacts on water 
quality, including turbidity in the water supply. 
Development proposals on or in proximity 
to sites with contaminated land must not 
introduce new pathways for contamination 
materials to reach groundwater.
384Explanation
11.62 Development sites and localities must be 
supported by efficient and well-functioning 
sewerage and wastewater infrastructure. The 
Council will continue to work with its key 
stakeholders, including Thames Water and other 
water companies, on its Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan. However, the short-term nature of water 
companies’ investment plans means that it is 
not possible to identify all of the infrastructure 
required over the plan period. The Local Plan 
therefore provides in-principle support for 
new or upgraded water supply and wastewater 
infrastructure where required. 
11.63 Lewisham has a mix of separate and combined 
sewer systems. Sewer flooding can arise in 
the foul system when surface water enters 
via misconnection, or where the capacity of 
combined systems is exceeded. In both cases 
this results in surcharge of contaminated surface 
water. Thames Water record sewer flooding 
incidents by postcode area and this information 
should be referred.
11.64 Applicants should engage with Thames Water, or 
other water and sewerage undertakers, early in 
the planning and design process. Where there is a 
capacity issue and there are no planned capacity 
works or upgrades, the applicant should agree 
with the infrastructure provider a programme 
of necessary improvements. These should be 
implemented prior to occupation. A Water Supply 
and/or Drainage Strategy may be required, 
such as for major development in areas where 
there are concerns about existing infrastructure 
provision. This supporting information should 
include a detailed model of the network capacity 
to determine whether mitigation is required.11.65 New development should ensure that storm flows 
are attenuated or regulated into the receiving 
public network through on or off-site storage. 
Where it is proposed to connect to a combined 
public sewer, the site drainage should be separate 
and combined at the final manhole nearest the 
boundary. Where it is proposed to discharge to a 
public sewer prior approval from Thames Water 
will be required. Connections to trunk sewers 
should be avoided - an alternative point of 
connection to a non-trunk sewer or requisition a 
new connection and associated pipe laying will 
be required. It is the responsibility of a developer 
to make proper provision for surface water 
drainage to ground, water courses or surface 
water sewer. It must not be allowed to drain to 
the foul sewer as this is the major contributor to 
sewer flooding.
11.66 The Thames Tideway Tunnel is a major project 
being undertaken by Thames Water and Thames 
Tideway Limited. The project will assist in 
upgrading to London’s sewerage system to cope 
with long-term future demands. The ‘supersewer’ 
will run across London and capture flows from 
sewer overflow points along the River Thames. 
There are two sites within Lewisham, one at Earl 
Pumping Station and one at Deptford Church 
Street. New development should not adversely 
impact on the construction, operation and long-
term maintenance of the tunnel infrastructure.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTURE11.67 The built environment plays a significant role 
in the way water is consumed, distributed and 
disposed of. The Environment Agency has 
declared the Thames Water region as to be 
“seriously water stressed” and this trend is likely 
to be exacerbated by climate change. This policy 
supports London Plan objectives for delivering 
a sustainable and secure water supply, and 
addressing water scarcity.
11.68 New residential development must meet 
the London Plan standard for mains water 
consumption, which reflects the Optional 
Requirement set out in Part G of the Building 
Regulations. Major non-residential development 
must meet BREEAM excellent standard for the 
‘Wat 01’ water category, to achieve at least 
a 12.5% improvement over defined baseline 
performance standard. In addition, major 
developments and high or intense water use 
developments (such as hotels) should include a 
grey water and rain water harvesting system, and 
applications must provide robust justification 
where this is not considered feasible. Planning 
conditions will be used to ensure water efficiency 
targets are met.
11.69 There are groundwater abstraction points in 
Lewisham that are used for the public water 
supply. The Environment Agency has identified 
and mapped Source Protection Zones (SPZs) 
and aquifers within the Borough. Development 
proposals must assess and manage risk to 
groundwater contamination in these areas and 
elsewhere across the Borough. Proposals that 
present an unacceptable risk to groundwater 
quality will be refused.
386SD11 Ground conditions
A Development proposals that will enable 
contaminated sites to be brought back into 
beneficial use will be supported where the 
requirements of B-D below are satisfied.
B Development proposals must demonstrate that 
any risks associated with land contamination, 
including to human health, public safety and 
the environment will be adequately addressed 
in order to make the development safe.
C Development proposals on land which 
is suspected of being contaminated or 
potentially contaminated, or if a sensitive use 
is proposed, must submit a Preliminary Risk 
Assessment (Phase 1 Study) to identify the 
level and risk of contamination on the site and 
adjacent land, and where necessary:
a. Undertake a Site Intrusive Investigation 
(Phase 2 Study) to provide a detailed 
assessment of contamination and risks to all 
receptors;
b. Prepare a Risk Management and 
Remediation Strategy appropriate to the 
individual site circumstances; and
c. Submit a Verification Plan and Closure 
Report prior to the occupation of the 
development.D Development proposals involving the 
storage or use of hazardous substances, or 
development of a site in the vicinity of a 
hazardous installation, will only be permitted 
where it is demonstrated that appropriate 
safeguards are in place to ensure there is no 
unacceptable risk to human health, public 
safety and the environment. 
E Planning conditions may be applied to ensure 
that remedial measures will be implemented 
and the development is safe prior to 
occupation.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
Contaminated land
11.70 Contaminated land is defined within the 
Environmental Protection Act 1990. It refers 
to land that has been polluted with harmful 
substances to the point where it could pose 
an unacceptable risk to human health and the 
environment. Environmental health and planning 
legislation requires the Council to ensure that 
land is assessed for contamination and made 
suitable for current and proposed future uses. 
Through the planning process we will seek that 
all development is appropriate to its location, 
whilst requiring landowners and developers 
to fulfil their responsibility for securing safe 
development where a site is affected by 
contamination.
11.71 In order to appropriately identify and manage 
the risks associated with land contamination 
development proposals must undertake a 
series of steps to ensure that development is 
safe. In the first instance a Preliminary Risk 
Assessment must be undertaken. This should 
consist of a desktop study and site walkover 
report that shows all previous and existing uses 
of the site and adjacent land. It should assesses 
the potential contamination risks to identified 
receptors. Following this preliminary assessment 
applicants will be required to submit, where 
appropriate:
• A Site Intrusive Investigation which provides a 
more detailed assessment of site characteristics 
and risks to receptors;
• Where contamination is present, a Risk 
Management and Remediation Strategy to deal 
with the identified hazards to human health and 
the environment, along with site management 
and monitoring arrangements;• A Verification Plan for any remediation works, 
completed by a suitably qualified professional, 
in order to ensure effective measures to protect: 
occupiers of the development and neighbouring 
land uses; the structural integrity of new and 
existing buildings; and any watercourses or 
aquifers; and
• A Verification/Closure Report, to be submitted 
prior to occupation, which demonstrates 
completion and validation of the works set out in 
the approved Risk Management and Remediation 
Strategy, including results of sampling and 
monitoring carried out in accordance with the 
Verification Plan.
11.72 The Council’s Environmental Protection service 
maintains a Contaminated Land Register and 
the Council’s website provides information that 
can direct applicants to further resources which 
may assist with site investigations and possible 
remedial measures. Planning conditions may be 
used to secure appropriate measures prior to the 
commencement and occupation of development.
11.73 When contaminated land has the potential 
to affect watercourses or groundwater, the 
Environment Agency should be contacted, as 
in certain circumstances it is the responsible 
authority under the Environmental Protection Act 
1990.
388Hazardous substances
11.74 Hazardous installations consist of sites and 
facilities for chemical processing, fuel and 
chemical storage and pipelines. It is important 
that any risks associated with hazardous 
substances (including to human health, safety 
and the environment) are appropriately managed 
and mitigated. There are listed hazardous 
installations both within and in proximity to 
the Borough, including the Lower Sydenham 
Gas Holders. Whilst hazardous substances are 
controlled by the separate need for hazardous 
substances consent along with health and safety 
regulations, the Local Plan also has a role in 
ensuring public safety from major accidents, 
consistent with the NPPF and its associated 
guidance.
11.75 All planning applications for hazardous 
installations, or the use of land in proximity 
to them, must suitably demonstrate that 
development will not constitute a risk to the 
population or the environment. In considering 
proposals and potential risks, we will apply the 
Health and Safety Executive (HSE) land use 
planning methodology and consult with the HSE, 
Environment Agency and other stakeholders 
as appropriate. Depending on individual site 
circumstances proposals may be required to 
submit a Preliminary Risk Assessment and/or a 
Risk Management Strategy that clearly identifies 
risks and sets out measures to appropriately 
manage and mitigate these.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTURETable 11.2: Safeguarded waste sites  
Figure 11.5: Safeguarded waste sites
390SD12 Reducing and sustainably managing waste 
A The Council will ensure that waste is 
sustainably managed in ways which protect 
human health and the environment. A circular 
economy approach will be promoted in 
Lewisham in order to conserve and make a 
more efficient use of resources, to achieve 
increases in the re-use and recycling of 
materials and reductions in waste going 
for disposal. Development proposals must 
apply the waste hierarchy and follow circular 
economy principles, in line with Policy SD 13 
(Design to support the circular economy).
B To help London achieve waste net self-
sufficiency, meet the Borough’s strategic waste 
apportionment target and other requirements, 
including the London Mayor’s recycling and 
composting targets, the Council will work in 
partnership with stakeholders including the 
South East London Joint Waste Planning 
Group. The following  are strategically 
safeguarded waste sites in Lewisham:
a. South East London Combined Heat and 
Power (SELCHP) energy recovery facility, 
New Cross
b. Recycling Centre (HTL Waste Management 
Services), New Cross
c. Reuse & Recycling Centre (London Borough 
of Lewisham), New Cross.
C Development proposals that will result in the 
loss of an existing waste site through a change 
of use will only be permitted where adequate 
replacement waste processing capacity is 
secured in accordance with London Plan policy 
SI9 (Safeguarded waste sites).D Development proposals for new waste 
management facilities will only be permitted 
where:
a. They are required within the Borough to 
meet an identified strategic need, having 
regard to the proximity and self-sufficiency 
principles;
b. It is demonstrated that the waste 
management capacity at existing 
safeguarded waste sites has been 
maximised, and there are no opportunities 
for appropriately increasing capacity at 
these sites to meet the identified need;
c. They are located within a Strategic 
Industrial Location, or involve alterations 
or extensions to an existing facility located 
outside a SIL, and have high quality 
supporting infrastructure necessary for the 
intended use;
d. They achieve a positive carbon outcome or 
demonstrate that steps are in place to meet 
the minimum greenhouse gas performance 
target, in line with London Plan policy 
SI8 (Waste capacity and net waste self-
sufficiency); and
e. They will not result in any adverse impacts 
on human health, the natural environment 
and local amenity, having regard to relevant 
legislation and other development plan 
policies.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREE Development proposals for waste management 
facilities must be located and designed with 
reference to the Agent of Change principle. 
They should be fully enclosed on all sides and 
have a roof along with fast-acting doors, and 
must be designed with these measures where 
the development is likely to have a significant 
impact on impact on local amenity.
F Where development proposals involve 
alterations to an existing waste management 
facility, they must demonstrate how they 
have maximised opportunities to improve the 
environmental performance of the facility as 
well as to reduce and mitigate its impact on 
local amenity.
392Explanation
11.76 The waste hierarchy (see Figure 11.6 ) is set out 
by the Waste Framework Directive 118 and provides 
a framework for how waste management can be 
made more sustainable. The aim is to move up the 
hierarchy away from a reliance on waste disposal. 
The London Plan principles on the circular 
economy for the sustainable use and management 
of materials and waste (see Figure 11.7 ) aligns 
with the hierarchy. The circular economy is one 
where materials are retained in use at their highest 
value for as long as possible and are then re-used 
or recycled, leaving a minimum of residual waste. 
The successful implementation of the waste 
hierarchy and circular economy principles are 
necessary to reduce the volume of waste that is 
produced and will need to be managed both in 
Borough and across London. The policy supports 
the Council’s Waste Management Strategy 2021-
2031. The strategy includes targets for recycling 
and composting which are cross-referenced in the 
Local Plan monitoring framework.11.77 The London Plan includes a strategic objective for 
London to be waste net self-sufficient by 2026. 
This means that all waste generated in London 
should also be managed within it, rather than 
being exported elsewhere. To support this objective 
the London Plan apportions a per cent share of 
London’s total waste to be managed by each 
borough, which is set out in tonnes. It then requires 
boroughs to allocate sufficient land and identify 
facilities to manage the apportioned tonnages of 
waste. The Council will continue with the approach 
to pool and manage the waste apportionment 
within its sub-region, working in partnership with 
other local authorities in the South East London 
Joint Waste Planning Group (SELJWPG). This 
includes Lewisham, Bexley, Bromley, Royal Borough 
of Greenwich and Southwark along with the City 
of London Corporation. The South East London 
Joint Waste Technical Paper has been prepared by 
the SELJWPG and provides further details on the 
pooled apportionment and waste management 
sites with capacity to manage this over the long-
term. The Technical Paper will be subject to periodic 
review and updating where necessary.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTURE39411.78 There are 3 strategic waste management sites in 
Lewisham which are safeguarded by the Local 
Plan.  They are located within the SIL at Surrey 
Canal Road. These sites and facilities are necessary 
to ensure that the Borough’s London Plan waste 
apportionment can be met, along with the pooled 
apportionment of the constituent SELJWPG 
authorities. In addition, there are a number of 
sites within the Borough with waste management 
permits from the Environment Agency. The London 
Plan states that waste sites should only be released 
to other land uses where waste processing capacity 
is re-provided elsewhere within London, based on 
the maximum achievable throughput of the site 
proposed to be lost. 
11.79 The South East London Joint Waste Technical Paper  
demonstrates that there is currently sufficient waste 
management capacity in the constituent Boroughs 
to meet the London Plan pooled apportionment. 
It also shows that there is a sufficient surplus 
of capacity that will provide for a robust buffer 
against any future changes to the sub-region’s 
apportionment requirements. Development 
proposals for new waste management facilities 
(including extensions to existing facilities) will 
therefore only be supported where they are required 
to meet an identified strategic need within the 
Borough, taking into account the pooled capacity 
within the sub-region, and also having regard to 
the proximity and circular economy principles. We 
will require all applications to provide evidence 
of a local need and to demonstrate that capacity 
at existing sites has been fully maximised before 
pursuing other development alternatives, taking 
into account the technical feasibility and financial 
viability. Consideration should be given to the 
enhancement of existing facilities through the site selection process. Development proposals for new 
or enhanced waste management facilities must be 
located within SILs, unless the proposal relates to an 
existing authorised facility, which are the Borough’s 
designated locations for general industrial and 
storage uses.  Other employment areas are not 
appropriate for this type of use. This is because the 
successful delivery of spatial strategy relies on the 
intensification of Mixed-use Employment Locations, 
Locally Significant Industrial Sites and certain non-
designated employment land, giving priority to 
Class E(g) (office and light industrial) uses to meet 
future employment needs. Development proposals 
for waste management will be assessed against 
relevant London Plan policies.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREFigure 11.7: Circular economy principles 
(London Plan and Dave Cheshire, AECOM)
396SD13 Design to support the circular economy
A Development proposals should apply circular 
economy principles in order to conserve resources 
and improve resource efficiency, with reference 
to London Plan policy SI7 (Reducing waste and 
supporting the circular economy).
B Major development proposals should aim to be 
net zero-waste. Development proposals that 
meet the threshold for being referable to the 
Mayor of London must submit a Circular Economy 
Statement, as part of the Sustainable Design 
Statement, in line with London Plan policy SI7.
C Development proposals must sustainably manage 
both the type and volume of recyclable materials 
and waste arising from the development during the 
construction and operational phases.
D Development proposals must be designed to 
ensure adequate on-site provision for the sorting 
of recyclable material, composting of organic 
material and the disposal of general waste during 
the occupation stage. They must make provision 
for:
a. Dedicated internal and external storage 
facilities, with flatted residential development 
including temporary storage space for 
each unit and communal storage for waste 
materials pending collection;
b. Safe and convenient access to storage 
facilities, both for building occupiers and 
collection services;c. Well sited and designed development that avoids 
and mitigates adverse impact on the amenity of 
building occupiers and neighbouring site users 
and uses; and
d. Separate provision for commercial and household 
waste where mixed-used development is 
proposed.
E All proposals for new multi-storey development, 
including flatted residential development, must also 
make provision for sensitively designed storage and 
collection systems at each floor unless it is suitably 
demonstrated that other designs can appropriately 
service the development. Proposals should avoid 
the use of forecourts or ground floor internal waste 
storage where this may adversely impact on the 
amenity of the building’s occupiers and surrounding 
properties
F Where public realm is included as part of a 
development proposal appropriate provision for 
recycling and waste disposal facilities will be required. 
Provision should be sensitively located and designed 
with accessible and clearly legible facilities to enable 
the public to easily distinguish between options for 
sorting of recyclable material, disposal of general 
waste and where appropriate, composting of organic 
material.

11 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INFRASTRUCTUREExplanation
11.80 Development proposals should refer the London 
Plan and London’s circular economy route 
map119 for further policies and guidance on 
the application of circular economy principles. 
Major development proposals present significant 
opportunities for innovative design and 
construction. Development proposals that are 
referable applications to the Mayor of London 
must submit a Circular Economy Statement 
demonstrating how the circular economy 
principles have been taken into account. This 
should be included as part of the Sustainable 
Design statement. The London Mayor’s Circular 
Economy Statement Guidance should be referred 
for further information.
11.81 Development proposals should maximise 
opportunities to design adaptable buildings and 
spaces. Residential developments are unlikely to 
change use given housing needs and residential 
land values in the Borough. However this should 
not discourage designs that can extend the life 
of developments, for example, with durable 
materials and adaptable spaces. Non-residential 
developments, such as retail and commercial 
uses, are likely to have shorter lifespans or a 
range of end-users and are therefore well suited 
to adaptive design. 11.82 All development proposals must consider 
options for sustainably managing the materials 
used and arising from the development using 
the design-led approach. This will ensure 
the most appropriate and practical solutions 
are employed during the construction and 
occupation stages. It is important that recycling, 
composting and waste management facilities 
are well designed, particularly in the interests of 
amenity. New multi-storey flatted development 
poses unique challenges given the number of 
households that require provision, the limited 
space available for sorting, collection and 
servicing, and the unique nature of managing 
waste through vertically stacked buildings. 
However, this should not preclude occupiers 
benefitting from suitable and convenient access 
to facilities, and that waste collection services 
are not compromised by poorly designed and 
laid out buildings.
11.83 Public realm must also be adequately serviced 
with readily accessible and clearly legible 
recycling and waste disposal facilities, where 
appropriate. Public spaces should include 
adequate provision of facilities that encourage 
easy separation of recyclable and waste 
materials at the point of disposal. Not only will 
this assist with reducing waste but it can help to 
protect local amenity through the avoidance of 
unsightly litter.

A The integration of land use and transport, 
along with an effective public transport 
network, are essential to delivering inclusive, 
safe, healthy, liveable, walkable and sustainable 
neighbourhoods in Lewisham. Development 
proposals  must make the most effective use 
of land and optimise the capacity of sites by 
taking into account connectivity and access to 
existing and planned future public transport. 
Priority should be given to reducing car use 
and both promoting and enabling movement 
by walking, cycling and the use of public 
transport.
B Development proposals should seek to improve 
and must not adversely impact on the effective 
functioning and safe use of Lewisham’s 
transport network and public realm, including 
walking and cycling transport infrastructure.C The land, buildings, space and supporting 
infrastructure required for the construction 
and operation of Lewisham’s network of 
strategic and other transport infrastructure 
will be safeguarded, including for the schemes 
identified in Table 12.1 . Development 
proposals will be required to provide adequate 
protection for, and respond positively to the 
need to facilitate the delivery of, the Borough’s 
network of transport infrastructure. 
D To encourage and enable  modal shift 
away from car use to more sustainable 
transport modes, as well as to tackle local 
deprivation by ensuring equality of access to 
opportunities, the Council will work positively 
and in partnership with stakeholders to secure 
improvements to the public transport network

E Development proposals should use the design-

to remove barriers to access and introduce 
measures that encourage and enable 
movement by walking and cycling. They 
must address the movement and connective 
function of the public realm along with its 
place qualities with reference to Policies 
QD3 (Public realm and connecting places) 
and TR3 (Healthy streets as part of healthy 
neighbourhoods).
Assessing and mitigating transport impacts
F Transport Assessments, Transport Statements 
and/or Travel Plans must be submitted with 
applications for Major development and 
other development proposals that are likely 
to impact on the capacity and functioning of 
the transport network (including walking and 
cycling transport infrastructure, deliveries and 
servicing, and the Bakerloo line extension). 
These should be commensurate with the 
nature and scale of development proposed and 
provide a sufficient level of information for 
the Council, Transport for London and other 
relevant authorities to assess applications, 
and for development proposals to adequately 
address impacts at the local, network-wide 
and strategic level where relevant.G  Development proposals that do not comply 
with (B) and (C) above, or otherwise prohibit 
or prevent the necessary and safe functioning 
of Lewisham’s transport infrastructure and 
network, will be refused unless it can be 
demonstrated that adverse impacts will be 
avoided or appropriately mitigated. Proposals 
must deliver direct mitigation measures, with 
suitable alternative provision that is agreed by 
the relevant transport authorities and service 
providers, including Transport for London, and/
or planning contributions, where appropriate.
H Development proposals will be assessed having 
regard to the cumulative impact of development 
including within Lewisham and neighbouring 
local authority areas. 
I Where there are identified capacity issues with 
respect to the additional travel demand expected 
to be generated by new development proposals, 
planning permission will be contingent on the 
provision of the necessary public transport 
and/or walking and cycling infrastructure to 
cater for this demand, in line with London Plan 
Policy T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport 
impacts). Consideration will be given to both 
existing and planned transport infrastructure, 
taking into account timeframes and funding 
committed for any future schemes. The Council 
will use measures to ensure that development is 
appropriately phased in order to avoid excessive 
strain on the transport network and to ensure 
additional infrastructure demands arising from 
the development (including for community 
and green infrastructure) can be appropriately 
accommodated.

12 TRANSPORT AND CONNECTIVITYExplanation
12.1 An effective, resilient and safe transport network 
is necessary to ensure equality of access to 
opportunities for people in Lewisham and to 
facilitate Good Growth. The integration of land use 
and transport is an important consideration both 
at the strategic Borough-wide and site level. The 
Local Plan supports the London Mayor’s Transport 
Strategy, the Council’s Transport Strategy and 
Local Implementation Plan and the Lewisham Cycle 
Strategy by seeking to rebalance the transport 
system away from car use and towards more 
sustainable transport modes. This policy sets out 
our approach to facilitate this ‘modal shift’ so 
that Lewisham contributes to the achievement 
of the London Plan target for 80 per cent of all 
journeys in London to be made by walking, cycling 
or public transport by 2041; as in inner-London 
borough, Lewisham’s modal shift target is 90 per 
cent. The policy also forms part of our response to 
the climate emergency as a means to significantly 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions locally, along 
with tackling the associated issues of poor air 
quality and noise. 
12.2 There is an uneven distribution of public transport 
provision in the Borough. Neighbourhoods around 
New Cross, Deptford, Lewisham and Catford are 
generally well served by rail and bus transport. 
A high concentration of stations link to frequent 
services on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), 
National Rail and London Overground networks. 
However, other parts the Borough do not benefit 
from the same level of provision and connectivity. 
Furthermore, bus and rail orbital routes are 
somewhat limited, making radial movements 
typically faster than orbital trips. The main orbital 
road links, such as the South Circular, contribute 
to orbital trips being more attractive by car. This situation, combined with the uneven distribution 
of public transport infrastructure, has contributed 
to a greater reliance on car use in some areas.
12.3 Investment in transport infrastructure is 
necessary to support the levels of growth 
planned within the Borough as well as to 
substantially increase the proportion of journeys 
being made by walking, cycling and public 
transport. An indicative list of strategic transport 
schemes is set out in Table 12.1 . These schemes 
have been signposted as they will play a key role 
in supporting the delivery of the spatial strategy 
for the Borough. However a wider complement of 
transport projects are also needed to address the 
accessibility issues in local areas. This list should 
therefore be read together with Lewisham’s 
Transport Strategy and Local Implementation 
Plan, Lewisham’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan and 
Table 10.1 in the London Plan120.  
120 London Plan (2021) Table 10.1 provides an indicative 
list of transport schemes across London. 
406Whilst the delivery of the spatial strategy is not 
dependent on the Bakerloo line extension  the 
scheme will play a vital role in supporting growth 
and regeneration, particularly in the Opportunity 
Areas and the Bell Green and Lower Sydenham 
area.  It will also help to address the increase 
in passenger demand arising from London’s 
growth. Further details are set out in Policy TR2 
(Bakerloo line extension).
12.4 We will work proactively with key stakeholders 
(including the Greater London Authority / 
Transport for London and Network Rail) along 
with landowners and development industry 
partners to deliver new and improved transport 
infrastructure. This includes safeguarding the 
land, sites, buildings, space and associated 
infrastructure required to facilitate the 
construction and safe operation of Lewisham’s 
transport network. Development proposals will 
be required to provide adequate protection for, 
and respond positively to the need to facilitate, 
strategic and other transport infrastructure.
12.5 High quality public realm underpins the 
integrated approach to land use and transport. 
By improving the public realm and making places 
and streets well-connected, greener, safer and 
more accessible, we aim to encourage and better 
enable movement by walking, cycling and public 
transport. Further details on public realm are set 
out in Policies QD3 (Public realm and connecting 
places) and TR3 (Healthy streets as part of 
healthy neighbourhoods). Assessing and mitigating transport impacts
12.6 It is important that new development avoids and/
or mitigates any potential adverse impacts on the 
transport network. In order to ensure that impacts 
are appropriately identified and addressed through 
the planning process, development proposals will 
be required to include a Transport Assessment, 
Transport Statement and/or Travel Plan, where 
appropriate. The information should be sufficiently 
detailed and accurate to allow for the clear 
identification and assessment of specific impacts 
and to inform any necessary mitigation measures.
12.7 Transport Assessments should be undertaken 
in line with relevant good practice guidance, 
including that published by the Greater London 
Authority / Transport for London. Transport 
modelling may be required to demonstrate 
that a proposal will not result in any adverse 
impacts, either individually or cumulatively in 
combination with other development. Healthy 
Streets Assessments must be included as part of 
the Transport Assessment for major development 
proposals, in line with Policy TR3 (Healthy streets 
as part of healthy neighbourhoods). Where new or 
improved public realm is proposed within or around 
open spaces and biodiversity sites, this must be 
sensitively integrated to ensure that there will be 
no adverse impact on the environment.
12.8 Travel Plans must reflect the Local Plan priority 
given to supporting and enabling sustainable 
transport modes, including active travel along with 
use of public transport. They should address the 
accessibility requirements of all likely users of the 
development, taking into account the needs of 
disabled people and others with specialist mobility 
requirements.

408TR2 TR2 Bakerloo line extension 
A The Bakerloo line extension is fundamental 
to improving public transport access as well 
as supporting growth and regeneration in 
Lewisham and London. The Council will work 
in partnership with stakeholders to secure 
the timely delivery of the BLE in accordance 
with the London Plan. It will also seek to 
maximise the opportunities associated with 
the BLE by directing new investment to 
significantly improve accessibility across the 
Borough, tackle deprivation and optimise the 
development potential of sites in proximity to 
the BLE.
B Development proposals must demonstrate 
that they will facilitate and not preclude the 
delivery of the BLE, with reference to Policy 
TR1 (Sustainable transport and movement). 
They must take into account taking into 
account Ministerial safeguarding Directions 
and relevant Mayor of London / Transport 
for London infrastructure requirements and/
or feasibility studies associated with BLE, and 
should consult with relevant transport bodies 
at the early stage of the planning process;  C Development proposals on sites located within 
400 metres of a proposed Bakerloo line station 
or safeguarded area must demonstrate that 
development will not preclude or delay the 
delivery of the BLE,  will not lead to excessive 
cost in the delivery, and must be compatible 
with the BLE (for example, in relation to 
vibration from the tunnels), both during 
construction and in operation. Foundation and 
basement design will be particularly critical for 
over tunnel alignments, ground level needs at 
stations and for other work sites. Development 
proposals must also be designed to optimise 
the accessibility provided by the introduction 
of the BLE into the local area. This may include 
provision for new or improved public realm and 
transport infrastructure enhancements.
D Development proposals should optimise the 
use of land and capacity of sites taking into 
account the BLE and future improvements 
to Public Transport Access Levels enabled by 
its delivery. The Council will seek to ensure 
that development on sites in proximity to 
existing, planned or potential future Bakerloo 
line stations is appropriately phased in order 
to secure the most beneficial use of land, 
particularly to help meet Lewisham’s housing 
needs.

12 TRANSPORT AND CONNECTIVITY12.9 Despite its inner-London location Lewisham does 
not currently benefit from direct access to the 
London Underground network. However, the 
London Plan commits to extend the Bakerloo 
line from Elephant and Castle to Lewisham and 
beyond. We will continue to advocate and plan 
positively for the extension of the Bakerloo line. 
This strategic transport scheme will improve 
connectivity, increase the capacity and resilience 
of the transport network in London. It will also 
contribute to the delivery of Good Growth in 
Lewisham by encouraging and enabling modal 
shift which in turn can contribute to reducing 
carbon emissions and improving air quality. 
12.10 The Secretary of State has made formal 
safeguarding Directions for the Bakerloo line 
extension which will support the project in 
safeguarding sites and routing alignment. The 
Bakerloo line extension will make a higher 
number of homes possible within the existing 
Opportunity Area and that proposed at Bell 
Green/Lower Sydenham. As such, the extension 
is a catalyst for change, providing an opportunity 
to enhance the transport offer at Lewisham town 
centre which will support and enable growth 
while also enhancing the public realm and 
connectivity. At Lewisham, it will also provide 
an improved strategic public transport hub with 
improved National Rail and DLR stations and bus 
services. The Directions require the local planning 
authority to consult TfL on planning applications 
within the safeguarding zone’. A map of the 
safeguarding Direction area is included on 
the Policies Map. There is not currently a 
safeguarding Direction for Phase 2 of the BLE (i.e. the phase extending south beyond Lewisham 
station) as this phase is in the design and 
feasibility stages. Applicants should consult the 
Mayor of London and TfL at the early stage of 
the planning process for the latest information on 
infrastructure requirements for the BLE. Where 
the preferred route is not confirmed, feasibility 
studies can be helpful to provide an indication of 
land or sites that may be essential to enable the 
delivery of the BLE.
12.11 The Bakerloo line extension is critical to the 
achievement of our growth and regeneration 
objectives. The BLE will assist in addressing the 
existing inequality in access to public transport, 
particularly in the Borough’s southern area 
where there is a designated Strategic Area for 
Regeneration. The BLE will also play a vital role 
in stimulating inward investment and helping 
to unlock the development potential of sites, 
including those around stations and within areas 
along its route. For example, it will incentivise 
landowners to assemble and bring forward 
sites for redevelopment and help to ensure the 
optimal use of land, including higher density 
development in highly accessible areas. The 
scheme could potentially enable a future London 
Plan Opportunity Area designation in the Bell 
Green and Lower Sydenham area. The BLE Local 
Economic Impact Assessment (2020) sets out 
some of the key benefits this project offers for 
Lewisham and southeast London.Explanation

12 TRANSPORT AND CONNECTIVITY12.12 Given the expected transformative effects of 
the BLE it is important that new development 
helps to facilitate and does not preclude its 
delivery. This includes the safeguarding of land 
and buildings required for the construction 
and operation of the extension, including for 
its route, stations, portals, ventilation shafts 
and other operational functions. The nature 
and phasing of new development close to the 
route alignment or sites required for stations or 
construction has the potential to impact upon 
the deliverability of the scheme. Development 
proposals within 400 metres (approximately 
5 minutes walking distance) of a proposed 
Bakerloo line station will be heavily scrutinised 
and must demonstrate how they will ensure 
that development will not prejudice the 
scheme’s delivery, and responds positively to 
its introduction in the locality. This includes 
transport and public realm measures to enhance 
legibility and access to the station and the 
surrounding area by all sustainable modes of 
travel. Where the 400 metres zone extends 
into neighbouring Boroughs the relevant Local 
Planning Authority should be consulted on 
relevant policy requirements. 12.13 Development proposals should optimise the 
use of land and capacity of sites taking into 
account the BLE and future improvements to 
Public Transport Access Levels enabled by its 
delivery. A pragmatic and carefully managed 
approach to site development will be required. 
This is in order to ensure that new development 
contributes to the delivery of sustainable 
neighbourhoods and communities, with density 
levels that are appropriate to the site context, 
including public transport accessibility and 
local area character. For Major development 
proposals and development proposals delivered 
comprehensively through the masterplan 
process, we will seek to ensure that development 
is appropriately phased. Planning conditions 
may be applied to ensure that all or particular 
elements of a scheme proceed in a certain 
sequence. This includes the use of Grampian 
conditions.121  The Council will continue to liaise 
with landowners on a site and area-wide basis 
to understand their aspirations for landholdings, 
any redevelopment plans and the timing for this. 
Planning permission may be contingent on the 
provision of the necessary infrastructure to cater 
for additional demand arising from the scheme, 
in line with the Policy TR1 (Sustainable transport 
and movement) and London Plan Policy T4 
(Assessing and mitigating transport impacts).
121 This refers to conditions which prohibit development 
authorised by the planning permission or other aspects 
linked to the planning permission (e.g. occupation of 
premises) until a specified action has been taken (such as 
the provision of supporting infrastructure). Further details 
are set out in the National Planning Practice Guidance.

12 TRANSPORT AND CONNECTIVITYFigure 12.4: Strategic walking and cycling routes 
414TR3 Healthy streets as part of healthy neighbourhoods
A The Healthy Streets Approach will be 
promoted and implemented in Lewisham in 
order to support the delivery of inclusive, 
healthy, safe, liveable, walkable and 
sustainable neighbourhoods. Priority will 
be given to approaches and measures 
that encourage and  enable movement by 
walking, cycling  and public transport, so they 
become people’s preferred choice of travel in 
Lewisham.
B Development proposals must demonstrate 
how they have applied the London Plan 
Healthy Streets Approach and Indicators 
through the design-led approach. All major 
development proposals must submit a Healthy 
Streets Assessment as part of the Transport 
Assessment. Proposals will be supported where 
they have engaged positively with the Healthy 
Streets Approach to deliver public realm and 
other improvements that support walking, 
cycling and the use of public transport. Cycle 
infrastructure must be designed in accordance 
with the London Cycling Design Standards.
C The Healthy Streets Approach will have 
particular importance within town centres, 
along and around Growth Corridors and other 
key movement corridors that link Lewisham’s 
neighbourhoods and town centres with each 
other and those outside of the Borough. This 
includes corridors located in areas with lower 
Public Transport Access Levels and areas 
experiencing higher levels of deprivation. 
Development proposals must have regard 
to relevant guidance that supports corridor 
improvements, including the Council’s A21 
Development Framework.D Development proposals must safeguard and 
contribute to maintaining and enhancing 
the Borough’s network of walking routes 
and cycleways, including the Thames Path, 
South-East London Green Chain, Waterlink 
Way and other components of the Lewisham 
Links. Opportunities to enhance connections 
between existing and proposed future routes 
should be investigated and implemented 
wherever appropriate and feasible, including 
the expansion of cycle hire along these routes. 
Development proposals that adversely impact 
on the safety, quality and convenience of 
the Borough’s network of walking routes 
and cycleways, and associated infrastructure 
(including dedicated cycle parking provision), 
will be refused unless appropriate mitigation 
measures are provided.
E High quality public realm is integral to the 
delivery of the Healthy Streets Approach. 
In line with Policy QD 3 (Public realm and 
connecting places) development proposals 
must be designed to maximise the contribution 
that public realm makes to encourage and 
enable active modes of travel. This includes 
measures to reduce vehicle dominance and 
enhance access, permeability and connectivity 
to and within sites by maintaining or 
integrating safe and legible routes for walking 
and cycling along with removing barriers to 
movement, such as gates, guardrails and 
stepped kerbs.

12 TRANSPORT AND CONNECTIVITYF To support the Healthy Streets Approach 
development proposals should provide end-
of-trip facilities for cyclists that are easy to 
access and designed in accordance with the 
London Cycling Design Standards. These 
facilities should be provided at a level that is 
commensurate with the nature and scale of 
development and the required level of cycle 
parking, in line with the parking standards of 
Policy TR4 (Parking).
G To help facilitate liveable and sustainable 
neighbourhoods in Lewisham, the Council will 
work with stakeholders and local communities 
to investigate the feasibility of, and implement 
where appropriate, traffic management and 
other measures to improve the quality and 
amenity of residential areas. This may include 
interventions to reduce, re-route or calm 
vehicular traffic (particularly around schools 
and other community facilities) and/or lower 
speed limits in localities, as well as to enhance 
the quality and safety of the walking and cycle 
environment.
H Development proposals must be designed to 
ensure that the public realm is not adversely 
impacted by installations, including advertising 
columns, and seek opportunities to remove 
redundant installations wherever possible.
I To help facilitate modal shift the Council 
will work positively with its partners and 
stakeholders to raise awareness of active travel 
and to enhance opportunities for the public to 
access related training and funding.

Figure 12.5: Healthy Street Wheel (Lucy Saunders)
12.14 The Healthy Streets Approach is set out in the 
London Plan and underpins the Good Growth 
policies. It will be strongly supported in Lewisham 
in order to achieve a significant step-change 
away from car use to walking, cycling and the use 
of public transport. Key projects and initiatives 
that will support the Healthy Streets Approach 
are included in Lewisham’s Transport Strategy 
and Local Implementation Plan and Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan.  
12.15 Guided by the Healthy Streets Approach 
and its associated ‘Indicators’ we will work 
with stakeholders and development industry 
partners to deliver a wide range of public realm 
improvements. Together these will contribute 
to making Lewisham’s neighbourhoods more 
liveable and its streets safer, greener, less 
polluted, more legible and accessible to all. 
Development proposals should give priority to 
movement by walking and cycling in order to 
make active travel a more attractive option for 
people to move throughout the Borough.
12.16 Lewisham’s population is expected to continue 
to increase in the context of London’s growth. 
Maintaining the current levels and high 
proportion of journeys made by car is not 
efficient or sustainable. Many of London’s streets 
are already heavily congested and the road 
network has limited capacity to absorb further 
increases in the number of vehicles. In response 
to this situation, we will seek to deliver a more 
efficient and effective use of land. This includes 
rebalancing road space by promoting travel by 
walking, cycling and public transport.12.17 The Healthy Streets Approach will apply to all 
streets in the Borough. However to support 
the spatial strategy the Local Plan emphasises 
the need for public realm improvements in 
key locations, such as town centres, along 
and around Growth Corridors, within areas 
experiencing higher levels of deprivation and 
those with low Public Transport Access Levels. 
This includes the A21 Corridor which has the 
potential to significantly improve north to south 
connections and encourage multi-modal journeys 
by linking walking routes and cycleways with 
bus and rail services. Similarly, public realm 
improvements along the Ringway Corridor 
(Southend Land and Whitefoot Lane), New Cross 
Road / A2 and South Circular (A205) can help 
to improve orbital movements east to west. In 
addition to Growth Corridors it is imperative that 
there is good connectivity within and between 
town centres, along with improved access to 
community facilities and public transport nodes. 
417
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
12 TRANSPORT AND CONNECTIVITYDevelopment proposals should support the 
delivery of a fully integrated active travel and 
public transport network in Lewisham, with good 
linkages to neighbouring Boroughs and wider 
London.
12.18 High quality and effectively managed public 
realm is integral to the successful delivery of 
the Healthy Streets Approach.   This policy will 
work together with Policy QD3 (Public realm 
and connecting places). Development proposals 
must identify and proactively respond to issues 
of severance, poor connectivity, amenity and 
pollution (including air quality) to support 
the creation of healthy, attractive, vibrant and 
accessible neighbourhoods and places.  By 
transforming the quality of streets and other 
elements of the public realm, we also aim 
to encourage people to spend more time in 
public spaces. This can in turn provide more 
opportunities for recreation and socialising as 
well as help to support the vitality and viability of 
town centres and other places.
12.19 By referring the Indicators of the Healthy Streets 
Approach, and the London Mayor’s relevant 
guidance, development proposals should 
demonstrate how buildings, including their main 
access points, create a positive relationship with 
the street and help to improve local area amenity. 
Proposals should explore options to increase 
widths to footpaths and design buildings with 
vehicular access sited away from adjoining street 
junctions. Where such interventions cannot 
feasibly be delivered planning contributions may 
be sought for public realm enhancements to help 
mitigate impacts.  12.20 Improving safety on Lewisham’s roads is also 
a key objective of this policy. Where priority is 
given to safe movement by walking and cycling, 
there is a greater likelihood of reducing car useas 
well as the dominance and speed of vehicles 
speeds. This approach will support the Mayor of 
London’s ‘Vision Zero’ strategy of eliminating 
all deaths and serious injuries on the London 
transport network from all road collisions by 
2041.
12.21 Addressing the current high levels of inactivity 
amongst Londoners is a key focus of the Healthy 
Streets Approach. According to data cited in 
the London Plan, currently only 34 per cent of 
adult Londoners report having walked or cycled 
for two ten-minute periods on the previous day. 
This lack of activity is a cause of many of public 
health issues, including Type 2 diabetes, colon 
cancer, coronary heart disease and depression. 
Implementation of this policy within the Borough 
will deliver people-oriented infrastructure (such 
as street furniture, landscaping, and cycle 
parking) to encourage active travel, improving 
the health of our local communities over the 
long-term.
418TR4 Parking
A A carefully managed approach to parking, 
and particularly car parking, will be taken to 
support the delivery of inclusive, healthy, safe, 
liveable and sustainable neighbourhoods. 
In line with the London Plan, car-free 
development should be the starting point 
for all development proposals in places that 
are, or are planned to be well-connected by 
public transport with developments elsewhere 
designed to be car-lite, 
B Development proposals for car-free 
development will be supported where they 
are located in highly accessible and well-
connected locations. Elsewhere, car-free 
development will be supported where it can be 
suitably demonstrated that:
a. The development is appropriately located 
at a well-connected location with good 
walking and cycling access to local 
amenities and services; or
b. The development is appropriately located 
within an Opportunity Area, Growth Node, 
Regeneration Node, Growth Corridor or 
town centre where the Local Plan makes 
provision for significant public realm 
enhancements that will bring about 
attractive conditions for walking and cycling 
and improve access to local amenities and 
services; and    
c. There is an existing Controlled Parking Zone 
(CPZ), or a future CPZ can be established 
through planning contributions;
d. There is sufficient capacity on the public 
transport network or potential for active 
travel interventions or implementation of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in the local 
area to cater to the additional demand 
arising from the development, taking into 
account existing and planned transport 
infrastructure;
C Development proposals must not exceed the 
maximum car parking standards set out in the 
London Plan, including for:
a. Residential parking;
b. Office parking;
c. Retail parking; and
d. Hotel and leisure uses parking (including 
consideration of coach parking).
D Development proposals must make adequate 
provision for residential and non-residential 
disabled persons parking, recognising that car-
free development has no general parking but 
should still provide disabled persons parking. 
All such provision must be in accordance with 
the relevant London Plan standards and the 
requirements for design and management of 
parking bays.
E Development proposals must make provision 
for high quality and fit-for-purpose cycle 
parking in accordance with the London Cycle 
Design Standards. They must meet and 
wherever possible seek to exceed the minimum 
cycle parking standards set by London Plan 
(which for Lewisham are the ‘higher minimum’ 
standards). This includes sufficient provision 
of short and long-stay spaces along with 
spaces to accommodate larger cycles including 
adapted cycles for disabled people and cargo 
bikes.  
419
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
12 TRANSPORT AND CONNECTIVITYF Major development proposals, development 
proposals located within town centres and 
employment areas, or other developments 
likely to generate a significant number of 
visitors should integrate dedicated space 
for cycle hubs to accommodate provision of 
cycle parking including for cycle hire schemes 
and space for cargo bikes wherever feasible. 
Proposals for the comprehensive development 
of sites, including through masterplans, 
must demonstrate how they have maximised 
opportunities to deliver this provision in order 
encourage and enable cycling. 
G The Council will consider the need for 
Controlled Parking Zones to manage additional 
or new demand arising from development 
across the Borough, and will implement these 
where appropriate.
H In order to manage the parking demand 
associated with new development the 
Council will consider on a case-by-case basis 
whether it is appropriate to require that the 
development is Permit Free (except for Blue 
Badge holders). Proposals for new car-free 
development must be Permit Free.I Where car parking is appropriate, a minimum of 20 
per cent of total car parking spaces provided on-site 
must have active provision of charging points for 
electric or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles, with passive 
provision for all remaining spaces. In the case that 
a development has a Travel Plan in place, the levels 
of usage of electric or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles 
should be monitored, with new charging points 
installed as demand increases. 
J Parking Design and Management Plans (PDMPs) 
must be submitted with development proposals that 
include parking. PDMPs must also be submitted 
for development proposals without parking but 
which are likely to generate a significant demand for 
parking or impact on existing parking provision. 
K Development proposals for residential and 
commercial uses will be expected to investigate 
opportunities to implement rapid charging points, 
having regard to the Council’s Low Emissions Vehicle 
Charging Strategy.
L Surface-level car parking should be designed 
to be permeable, with reference to Policy SD8 
(Sustainable drainage),
42012.22 An effective and well-functioning road network 
is essential to supporting local businesses and 
London’s economy, the resilience and efficiency 
of emergency services and the public transport 
network. As the population grows the road 
network will not be able to absorb the additional 
cars that would result from continued levels of 
car ownership and use. In order to achieve the 
Local Plan’s strategic objectives and the London 
Mayor’s objective for 90 per cent of journeys in 
inner-London to be made by walking, cycling 
and the use of public transport, parking must be 
carefully managed and controlled. Reduced car 
parking provision together with improved walking 
and cycling infrastructure can support the 
creation of places that are designed for people 
rather than vehicles. 
12.23 The London Plan parking standards will be 
applied including the maximum standards for car 
parking. The London Plan makes clear that car-
free development should be the starting point 
for all development proposals in places that are, 
or are planned to be well-connected by public 
transport. Elsewhere, developments should be 
designed to provide the minimum necessary car 
parking (car-lite). 
12.24 Whilst some areas of the Borough may benefit 
from high Public Transport Access Levels, 
the lack of step-free access at stations can 
significantly constrain travel options and access 
for some users. We will continue work with key 
stakeholders, such as Transport for London and 
Network Rail, along with development industry 
partners to address step-free access and deliver 
this provision  which is necessary for inclusive 
and well-connected neighbourhoods.12.25 Development proposals must be designed to 
encourage and enable movement by walking 
and cycling. This will require that careful 
consideration is given to the design of public 
realm along with the provision of high quality 
and dedicated facilities for cyclists, including 
easily accessible, safe and secure cycle parking, 
taking into account the need to accommodate 
cargo-bikes. London Plan Policy T5 (Cycling) 
provides that Lewisham is a borough where the 
‘higher minimum’ cycle parking standards apply.
12.26 Cycle hire schemes are becoming an increasingly 
attractive, convenient and cost-efficient option 
for people to make part or all of their journeys 
by cycling. There are a number of schemes 
within the Capital with different operational 
requirements, ranging from dedicated docking 
stations to ‘remote collection and drop-off’, 
which are aided by new technology. To encourage 
cycling we are broadly supportive of these 
schemes, whilst recognising spaces do not 
count towards the cycle parking requirement 
for new development. The use of cycle hire 
schemes must be carefully managed to ensure 
that docking stations or cycles do not result in 
unsightly or hazardous street clutter, or otherwise 
adversely impact on the public realm, safety 
and local amenity. We will encourage proposals 
to investigate opportunities to make provision 
of dedicated space to accommodate cycle hubs 
and cargo bikes, so that they can be sensitively 
integrated into the site and neighbourhood. This 
is particularly for major development proposals, 
proposals within town centres and employment 
locations or those which are likely to attract 
a significant number of visitors (for example, 
cultural or education facilities).Explanation

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
12 TRANSPORT AND CONNECTIVITY12.27 The use of car clubs and electrically charged 
or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles can provide an 
alternative to car ownership and conventional 
gas fuelled vehicles. Development proposals 
must  make appropriate provision for rapid 
electrical vehicle charging points,  also having 
regard to the Council’s Low Emission Vehicle 
Charging Strategy,. However in light of the 
climate emergency the use of car clubs and Ultra-
Low Emission vehicles will need to be carefully 
managed. Whilst electric vehicles reduce tailpipe 
emissions they are carbon-intensive to produce 
and still add to congestion, road danger and 
severance. They also generate Particulate Matter 
through tyre and brake wear and can therefore 
contribute to poor air quality.
422TR5 Deliveries, servicing and construction
A Development proposals should facilitate 
sustainable freight, where possible, through 
water, rail, and road including for ‘last-mile 
distribution’. They must also facilitate and 
enable safe, clean and efficient delivery and 
servicing for all of the development’s intended 
occupiers and uses, including emergency 
services. Delivery and servicing requirements 
should be considered at the early stage of the 
design-led approach, particularly in mixed-use 
development, in order to ensure practical site 
layouts and building designs that protect local 
amenity and avoid or mitigate adverse impacts 
to the highway network.
B Provision of adequate space and facilities for 
deliveries and servicing should be made off-
street, with on street loading bays or other 
facilities only used where it is demonstrated 
this is necessary due to feasibility. Major 
and other larger developmentsshould make 
provision for well-integrated facilities to allow 
for deliveries to be received outside of peak 
hours and for secure, temporary storage of 
parcels or goods.
C Development proposals for commercial and 
industrial uses should ensure that parking 
provision for servicing and delivery is 
commensurate with the specific operational 
needs of the development. The level and 
type of parking provision will be considered 
on a case-by-case basis with reference to 
Policy TR4 (Parking). Proposals must provide 
evidence to demonstrate that the provision is 
appropriate to location, nature and scale of 
commercial or industrial use.D Major developments and other development 
proposals that are likely to generate a 
significant number of vehicle movements from 
deliveries, servicing or construction will be 
required to submit a Delivery and Servicing 
Plan and/or Construction Logistics Plan as 
part of the Transport Assessment. This should 
provide a sufficient level of detail about the 
servicing, delivery and freight requirements 
of the development from the construction to 
occupation stages, and demonstrate that all 
likely adverse impacts on local amenity and 
the highway network have been avoided or 
mitigated, recognising that final details may be 
sought by condition. Consideration should be 
given to the timing of deliveries.
E For major developments and other 
developments which are to be delivered 
comprehensively through a masterplan, 
proposals will be required to prepare and 
implement a site-wide strategy for deliveries, 
servicing and construction. This should 
support the design-led approach and help 
to enable coordination and integration of 
servicing requirements across the site(s). 
Development proposals, particularly those 
including commercial uses, are encouraged to 
optimise the use of land by making provision 
for shared storage, micro-consolidation and 
distribution facilities appropriate to use(s), 
scale and location of development.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
12 TRANSPORT AND CONNECTIVITYExplanation
12.28 Freight movement is an important consideration 
in the planning and design process. The London 
Plan seeks to facilitate sustainable freight 
movement by rail, river and road through the 
consolidation of activities, modal shift and 
improved coordination in the timing of deliveries. 
12.29 Careful consideration will need to be given to 
development proposals involving large-scale 
freight consolidation and distribution activities. 
All such proposals should be appropriately 
located, for example, in Strategic Industrial 
Locations. Consideration may also be given to 
the potential use of existing or proposed piers 
and structures to support small scale, last-mile 
distribution. Proposals must clearly demonstrate 
how they will address sustainable freight 
movement in the Borough without adversely 
impacting on the road network, local amenity or 
the environment. Consolidation and distribution 
uses should also be commensurate with the role 
and function of the site or area within which they 
are located. 
12.30 To support sustainable freight, and as part 
of Lewisham’s Transport Strategy, we will 
explore options and work with stakeholders to 
make provision for centralised delivery hubs, 
including secure lockers, in appropriate locations 
throughout the Borough. This will support our 
objectives around traffic reduction and reducing 
road danger, with consequential benefits in terms 
of address traffic congestion, poor air quality and 
noise pollution.12.31 Largely driven by advances in technology, the 
logistics and freight industry is rapidly shifting 
to a model of ‘last mile’ delivery. It is also 
adapting to changes in consumer behaviour 
and the rising popularity of home deliveries, 
including for groceries, other retail items and 
takeaway meals. These changes have contributed 
to the prevalence of delivery vehicles on the 
road network. They have also introduced new 
challenges for the design of buildings and spaces.
12.32 Delivery and servicing requirements for new 
development needs to be considered at the early 
stage of the design-led approach. Provision of 
adequate space and facilities should be made 
off-street and well-integrated into the site 
and locality. Larger developments, including 
residential and mixed-use schemes, have the 
capacity to generate a significant number of 
service and delivery trips, which will need to be 
addressed. Proposals should incorporate delivery 
receipt and storage facilities that suit the needs 
the intended occupiers and uses, include secure 
storage and where possible, containerised 
(cold storage). Opportunities should be taken 
to consolidate or coordinate provision in order 
reduce the number vehicle movements.
12.33 All major development proposals, and other 
proposals that are likely to result in a significant 
number of freight movements, including in 
the construction and operation stages will be 
required to submit a Delivery and Servicing Plans 
and/or Construction Logistics Plan. These should 
be prepared having regard to the latest Transport 
for London Guidance.
424TR6 Taxis and private hire vehicles
A Development proposals for offices, taxi ranks, 
and other operational space associated with 
taxis and private hire vehicle businesses 
(including minicabs) will only be supported 
where:
a. They are appropriately located, with priority 
given to sites within or in close proximity to 
town centres and at or near stations;
b. The development will not result in a harmful 
overconcentration of similar uses in the 
locality;
c. It is suitably demonstrated that there will 
be no adverse impact on amenity and the 
highway network, including existing on-
street parking provision;
d. Walking routes and cycleways  will not 
be adversely impacted, particularly where 
these are used for access to bus stops, 
station entrances and other public transport 
services;
e. The development, is of a high quality 
design; 
f. Offices and ranks are accessible and safe 
during operational hours, including through 
the use of appropriate lighting and CCTV; 
and
g. Parking spaces delivered on-site to meet 
the operational use of a building (including 
offices, hotels, community facilities and 
major public facilities) have active charging 
points for all designated taxi spaces, in line 
with the London Plan.B Development proposals will be assessed having 
regard to the cumulative impact of facilities 
for taxis and private hire vehicles in the locality 
and the London Plan strategic target to 
increase mode share for walking, cycling and 
public transport to 80% of all trips by 2041, 
and 90% in inner-London. 
425
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
12 TRANSPORT AND CONNECTIVITYExplanation
12.34 This policy sets out requirements for new 
development associated with taxi and private 
hire vehicle businesses, including minicabs. This 
type of development is distinguished from the 
land and facilities used for car clubs or car share 
services, which are dealt with separately in Policy 
TR4 (Parking).
12.35 The Local Plan seeks to deliver inclusive, healthy 
liveable and sustainable neighbourhoods by 
encouraging and enabling active travel and 
the use of public transport. However, it is 
recognised that other modes of travel play a role 
in supporting local residents, businesses and 
visitors, including taxis and private hire vehicles. 
This travel mode makes up a small proportion of 
local journeys, around 1 per cent of all trips per 
day in Lewisham.122 Yet it is an important part 
of London’s transport network and valuable for 
a wide range of users. This includes people with 
reduced mobility who require accessible door-
to-door transport services, or who those who 
do not have access to reliable alternative means 
of travel, for example, due to the lack of public 
transport accessibility or infrequent services.
12.36 Taxis and minicabs also provide a safe and 
regulated transport option. They assist people to 
complete journeys beyond the reach of the bus 
or train network, or in many cases, provide the 
only safe and convenient transport option during 
the early morning, evening and night-time. In 
addition, the taxi and private hire vehicle industry 
plays a role in the local and wider regional 
economy, and is in itself a source of jobs.  As of July 2019, there were over 20,000 licensed 
taxi drivers and 100,000 licensed private vehicle 
hire drivers registered in London.
12.37 A carefully managed approach is therefore 
necessary to ensure the appropriate management 
of land for transport functions, including that 
required for taxis and private hire vehicles. 
Facilities should ideally be located in close 
proximity to town centres or train stations where 
there are compatible land-uses, opportunities 
for linked trips and where journeys are most 
likely to originate or end. Proposals will be 
expected to demonstrate that development will 
not result in an overconcentration of similar 
uses in the locality. The cumulative impact of 
development will therefore be a consideration in 
the assessment of proposals.
12.38 Development proposals for taxis and private 
hire vehicles must be of a high quality design. 
Taxi offices, ranks and other facilities should 
be appropriately sited and provide all users of 
the development with good levels of safety and 
security, including through sensitively integrated 
lighting and the use of CCTV. It is also important 
that facilities are designed to be accessible to all.

426TR7 Digital connectivity
A Digital connectivity infrastructure is necessary 
for access to services and other opportunities, 
inclusive communities and growth and 
diversification of the local economy. The Council 
will work with stakeholders to address barriers to 
digital access and secure the provision of high 
quality, fast and reliable digital infrastructure 
across Lewisham..
B In line with London Plan Policy SI6 (Digital 
connectivity infrastructure) development 
proposals will be required to take appropriate 
measures to enable full-fibre, or equivalent 
infrastructure, connectivity to all end users 
within new development, along with meeting 
the expected demand for mobile connectivity 
generated by the development. Proposals must 
demonstrate that the development will be 
‘connection-ready’ on first occupation.
C Development proposals must demonstrate how 
they will improve digital connectivity on sites 
located in areas where full-fibre broadband, 
or equivalent infrastructure, is not currently 
available or on sites that are otherwise poorly 
served by broadband coverage, including in 
designated employment areas and town centres. 
Proposals must have regard to Lewisham’s 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan and other relevant 
information on broadband coverage.
Infrastructure and equipment design
D Development proposals for digital connectivity 
infrastructure and associated equipment will 
only be supported where it can be suitably 
demonstrated that:
a. The infrastructure and equipment is the 
minimum needed to meet operational requirements, having regard to future demand 
or planned improvements; 
b. Opportunities for infrastructure and equipment 
sharing have been fully investigated and taken 
into account;
c. There will be no significant adverse impact on 
the visual amenity of the occupiers of the host 
building, where relevant, and neighbouring 
occupiers;
d. There will be no adverse impact on open space 
and biodiversity;
e. If located on a main road or walking route, a 
minimum residual footway is provided;
f. Detrimental impact on the external appearance 
of the host building or structure, street scene 
or space on which the equipment is located will 
be avoided or appropriately mitigated; and
g. The infrastructure and equipment is sensitively 
located and appropriately designed, and does 
not detract from local area character, having 
particular regard to:
i. The need to preserve or enhance the 
significance of heritage assets, including 
Listed Buildings and conservation areas;
ii. The use of design treatments to ensure 
the least possible visual impact, including 
colour, landscape and other interventions 
to help screen or conceal cabling and other 
apparatus; and
iii. The cumulative impact of 
telecommunications installations on a 
structure, site or area.
E In order to minimise visual impact all digital 
connectivity infrastructure and equipment should 
be removed as soon as reasonably practicable 
once it is not required for use, and older 
equipment should be upgraded wherever feasible.

12 TRANSPORT AND CONNECTIVITY12.39 Digital connectivity infrastructure is playing an 
increasingly important role in the functioning 
of cities and society. It is transforming how 
infrastructure and services are provided, with 
innovative ‘Smart City’ technologies that make 
use of information to deliver more resource 
and cost efficient provision. It is also helping 
to facilitate different forms of communication 
between people as well as enabling more 
convenient and wider access to goods and 
services. In addition, digital connectivity 
infrastructure is important for business and now 
considered essential to sustainable economic 
development.
12.40 Digital connectivity infrastructure also has 
implications for physical connectivity and 
the transport network. For example, new 
technologies are changing the way in which 
people work and commute, often reducing the 
need for workers in some industries to travel. The 
Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the transition 
to online and flexible working arrangements. 
Further, smart technologies are supporting 
efficiencies in the distribution and logistics 
sector, with improved timing and coordination 
in servicing and deliveries. Over time these 
technologies may have significant impacts on the 
transport network by helping to reduce demand 
and/or the volume of movements, particularly 
during traditional peak hours.Explanation
12.41 Digital connectivity infrastructure is necessary 
to support inclusive and sustainable 
neighbourhoods and communities. Not all 
areas of Lewisham benefit from the same level 
of provision. Premium full-fibre broadband is 
currently only available in 13 per cent of the 
Borough and there is very limited availability 
in the area covering the Lewisham Creative 
Enterprise Zone.123 It is vitally important that 
full-fibre broadband coverage is provided and 
enhanced. This is to ensure equality of access 
to services for people in Lewisham and to 
support our economic development objectives, 
particularly to grow the cultural and creative 
industries. We will therefore work with industry 
stakeholders and development industry partners 
to ensure the provision of high quality, fast and 
reliable digital connectivity infrastructure across 
the Borough, including full-fibre or equivalent 
broadband.

428Infrastructure and equipment design
12.42 It is important that digital connectivity 
infrastructure is of a high quality design and 
appropriately managed. This will ensure that 
development does not adversely impact on 
amenity, local character, heritage assets, open 
space and biodiversity and the functioning 
of the public realm.  Development proposals 
should be sited and designed so to avoid or have 
the least detrimental visual impact and must 
respond positively to local character including the 
significance of heritage assets and their setting.  
Proposals should consider how to conceal 
equipment by using design treatments including 
colour, landscaping  and GRP shrouds or screens. 
, i Development located on a principal street 
frontage must be well designed and sensitively 
integrated onto or within a building, structure, or 
space and disguised from view wherever feasible.
12.43 Development proposals must demonstrate that 
they have optimised opportunities to mitigate 
visual impacts. Applicants should engage 
with neighbouring landowners, infrastructure 
providers and service operators to investigate 
the feasibility for sharing equipment, such 
as masts and cabinet boxes. This should 
include consideration of any planned future 
improvements necessary to meet the needs of 
current or future occupiers within a site or area.12.44 The Manual for Streets should be referred for 
guidance on appropriate residual distances where 
development is located on a main road. In town 
centres and other high traffic areas, the minimum 
residual distance of 1.8 metres may not be 
sufficient to enable appropriate pedestrian flow, 
and the minimum width will be determined based 
on the number of pedestrians per square metre 
and pedestrian flows per minute.
12.45 Digital connectivity infrastructure  including 
supporting structures and equipment (such as 
masts, cabinet boxes, satellite and other dishes, 
antennae, cabling, shrouds and stands) should be 
removed as soon as reasonably practicable once 
it is not required. This will help to ensure that the 
quality of townscapes, streetscapes and public 
realm are not adversely impacted by unnecessary 
clutter.

434Celebrating Lewisham’s 
diversity and valuing its 
distinctiveness
13.1 Lewisham is a diverse Borough comprising many 
communities of people, neighbourhoods and 
places, all of which have distinctive identities that 
should be celebrated and valued. The Local Plan 
aims to respond to the unique qualities of our 
communities and neighbourhoods in supporting 
Good Growth. To achieve the Vision for Lewisham 
and secure the successful delivery of the Plan’s 
spatial strategy, new development must respect 
and contribute positively to Lewisham’s local 
distinctiveness.
13.2 To assist people with understanding and 
appreciating Lewisham’s local distinctiveness, 
and to establish ‘place-based’ priorities for 
guiding investment and sensitively managing 
new development, this part of the Local Plan 
is organised around five character areas. These 
areas contain a number of neighbourhoods which 
together share similarities that distinguish them 
from other parts of the Borough124.  This includes 
similarities in the prevailing urban form, historic 
character, topography, landscape and other 
features. Figure 13.1  illustrates the extent of the 
character areas and their neighbourhoods.13.3 Each character area will play an important role 
in supporting the delivery of the Borough’s 
spatial strategy, helping to accommodate 
growth that meets local needs (such as for 
genuinely affordable housing, new workspace 
and supporting infrastructure). To set clear 
expectations in this respect, and to ensure that 
new development is sensitively integrated into 
our neighbourhoods, the Local Plan sets out 
a future vision, key (spatial) objectives and 
place principles for each area. These should be 
used to inform investment decisions and guide 
development proposals.
13.4 In addition, each character area is accompanied 
by site allocation policies. These establish land 
use principles and design guidelines for strategic 
development sites. These sites have been 
included within the Local Plan because they are 
considered necessary to support the delivery of 
the spatial strategy for the Borough.
124 The setting of the character areas has been informed 
by the Lewisham Characterisation Study (2019), 
which should be referred for further information. We 
acknowledge the neighbourhood boundaries overlap with 
each other, and that communities may define themselves 
around different geographies and social contexts. 
However, the organisation of the Borough in this way 
provides a useful starting point for a place-based planning 
and delivery framework.

13 LEWISHAM’S NEIGHBOURHOODS AND PLACESLewisham in the context of London
13.5 It is recognised that neighbourhoods and 
communities are defined around different 
geographies and social contexts, and that 
people’s sense of place is not solely shaped 
by the extent of Lewisham’s administrative 
boundaries. Places and spaces beyond the 
Borough also contribute to local distinctiveness 
and influence the way in which people relate 
to their surroundings. The vision and place 
principles for each character area are therefore 
informed by Lewisham’s relationships with other 
London boroughs, particularly those adjoining it.
13.6 The overarching objective for “An Open Lewisham 
as part of an Open London” reflects our 
commitment to strengthening relationships with 
the rest of the Capital. This will not only promote 
inclusive neighbourhoods and communities but is 
necessary to support the delivery of the London 
Plan’s spatial development strategy. The Local 
Plan sets out a shared vision for how Lewisham’s 
character areas should evolve over time, building 
on their functional relationships with other parts 
of London. This includes, for example, cross-
boundary relationships established through 
transport connections and the public realm, the 
network of green infrastructure (including open 
spaces and waterways), town centres and the 
local economy. As well, the character areas will 
be influenced by their changing sub-regional 
context, including significant new development 
delivered in Opportunity Areas near the Borough, 
such as Canada Water and Old Kent Road in 
Southwark and at Greenwich Peninsula.
436Delivering the spatial 
strategy and meeting local 
needs
13.7 To help to facilitate Good Growth in Lewisham the 
Local Plan includes site allocation policies. These 
are detailed policies for strategic development 
sites that are critical to the delivery of the spatial 
strategy. The sites will play an important role in 
addressing the Borough’s needs for new housing, 
workspace and main town centre uses, along with 
supporting infrastructure (including community 
facilities, transport and green infrastructure).
13.8 Each site allocation includes information on the 
development capacity of a site for different types 
of land uses. The process for identifying sites 
and the methodology used for setting capacity 
figures are set out in the “Lewisham Local Plan: 
Site Allocations Background Paper” – this should 
be referred for further information. The site 
capacities are indicative only and should not be 
read prescriptively for the purpose of planning 
applications, where the optimal capacity of a site 
must be established on a case-by-case basis using 
the design-led approach, and having regard to 
Table 13.1: Site allocations – indicative delivery outcomes over 20 year Plan period

area. This demonstrates that the Local Plan has 
identified sites with sufficient capacity to meet 
and exceed the Borough’s housing targets as well 
as exceeding the needs identified in our latest 
Employment Land and Retail Capacity Studies125. 
This will allow for flexibility and enable the 
delivery of sufficient homes and non-residential 
floorspace, should some of the site allocations 
not be brought forward for development or their 
delivery delayed.
125 For the South area, the housing capacity figures are 
set out as a range. This is owing to the significant uplift in 
development capacity that could be achieved on selected 
sites in Bell Green / Lower Sydenham through delivery of 
Phase 2 of the Bakerloo line extension.Figures may differ slightly due to rounding

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE14.1 Lewisham’s Central Area contains the 
neighbourhoods of Lewisham, Hither Green and 
Catford. It has a strong relationship with the 
Ravensbourne, Pool, and Quaggy rivers and their 
river valley corridors. The housing character is 
generally varied as a result of post-WWII patterns 
of development, with Conservation Areas and 
listed buildings within and adjacent to the 
area. The Central Area contains the linked but 
complementary town centres of Lewisham and 
Catford.
14.2 The character of Lewisham Major Centre 
and its surrounds is strongly informed by its 
shopping and leisure destinations, as well as its 
highly active public places, including the rail 
interchange and market. It has a distinctive urban 
character with a tall buildings cluster which is 
surrounded by lower density residential terraces. 
Whilst public realm improvements have been 
delivered through the redevelopment of larger 
sites over recent years much of the town centre 
remains fragmented and disconnected from its 
surrounding neighbourhoods .There remain areas 
with poorer quality public realm, particularly 
on Lewisham High Street.  There are significant 
site redevelopment opportunities, including the 
1970s built shopping centre and multi-storey car 
park, which alongside planned public transport 
improvements, will allow the character of 
Lewisham to be ‘reimagined’.14.3 Catford Major Centre comprises the civic hub 
of the Borough with a key focal point at the 
historic Broadway Theatre. The town centre has 
a distinctive urban character with office and 
commercial buildings which are surrounded 
by smaller scale, established residential areas 
and high quality open spaces. Some sites have 
recently been redeveloped to a high quality 
design standard, such as the Catford Stadium, 
which has enabled river restoration works. 
However the layout of larger sites and blocks, 
and the location of the South Circular dissecting 
the town centre, creates issues of severance and 
poor permeability with the town centre and its 
surrounds.. The quality of the public realm is 
generally poor throughout the centre, particularly 
along the South Circular and at its junction with 
Rushey Green (A21). There are significant site 
redevelopment opportunities, which alongside 
planned transport improvements, will allow the 
character of Catford to be ‘reimagined’.
14.4 The A21 Corridor is currently dominated by  
vehicles, giving rise to issues of congestion, noise 
and poor air quality. Its poor quality public realm 
inhibits movement by walking and cycling. The 
High Street is generally not well connected to its 
surrounding neighbourhoods, and is dominated 
by larger sites and blocks leading to irregular 
east-west connections. Whilst the character of 
the Corridor is well established around Lewisham 
Hospital (with opportunities to ‘reinforce’ the 
existing character), opportunities exist for 
intensification along the majority of the corridor. Context and character
44014.5 Hither Green is characterised by predominantly 
established residential areas of a Victorian 
character which are serviced by local centres and 
parades, including near Hither Green station and 
along Hither Green Lane.. The prominence of the 
rail lines creates severance and limits connectivity 
through the neighbourhood and east towards Lee. 
The station approach to the west of the station has 
poorer quality public realm. There are opportunities 
for the sensitive intensification of the area through 
small sites development to ‘reinforce’ the existing 
local character and enhance the vitality and 
viability of commercial areas.

14 LEWISHAM’S CENTRAL AREAVision
Figure 14.1: Central Area14.6 By 2040 the linked but complementary town 
centres of Lewisham and Catford will evolve as 
vibrant hubs of commercial, cultural, civic and 
community activity. The character and role of 
the centres, and the A21 corridor that connects 
them, will be re-imagined by building on the 
area’s many attributes and excellent transport 
links. The arrival of the Bakerloo line together 
with the modernisation of Lewisham interchange 
will open opportunities for everyone to benefit 
from.
14.7 New housing, including a high proportion of 
genuinely affordable housing, business space and 
jobs, and community facilities will be focussed 
along the A21 Corridor (Lewisham High Street, 
Rushey Green and Bromley Road), encompassing 
Lewisham and Catford town centres, as well 
as out-of-centre retail parks. The A21 will be 
transformed using the Healthy Streets Approach,  
with public realm enhancements that better 
connect neighbourhoods and make walking, 
cycling and the use of public transport safer and 
more convenient. Lewisham Major Centre will 
become a highly accessible Metropolitan Centre 
of exceptional quality; its continued evolution 
supported by new transport infrastructure 
and the renewal of larger sites, including the 
shopping centre. The re-routing of the South 
Circular (A205) will enable the comprehensive 
regeneration of Catford major centre into 
London’s greenest town centre, with high quality 
public realm enhancing links to the stations and 
supporting its role as the Borough’s main civic 
and cultural hub. In Hither Green and elsewhere, 
the character of established residential areas will 
be reinforced, with their sensitive intensification 
providing for improvements throughout the wider 
area.14.8 Residents and visitors will benefit from excellent 
access to high quality parks, open and green 
spaces. The river valley network will have 
greater prominence. Improvements to the 
environmental quality and amenity value of 
the Rivers Ravensbourne, Quaggy and Pool 
will be realised through their re-naturalisation, 
particularly around the key visitor destinations 
of Lewisham and Catford centres. Waterlink Way, 
running alongside the River Ravensbourne, will 
be enhanced, with breaks in the route repaired to 
form the central feature of a network of walking 
and cycle routes that link open and green spaces.
442Key spatial objectives 
Table
TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION OUR KEY SPATIAL OBJECTIVES (NOT LISTED IN ORDER OF PRIORITY) 
ARE TO:
1 Secure the delivery of the Bakerloo line extension and Lewisham interchange upgrade to improve public transport 
access within the Borough and to help unlock the development potential of the Opportunity Area.
2 Facilitate the renewal of Lewisham Major Centre into a well-connected modern metropolitan centre and 
employment hub. Strengthen the centre’s role as a community and cultural destination, building on the 
presence of a thriving market at its heart. Enhance routes and permeability within and through the centre by the 
redevelopment of larger sites, including the shopping centre.
3 Secure the re-routing of the South Circular (A205) to enable the comprehensive regeneration of Catford Major 
Centre into London’s greenest town centre, and reinforce and expand its role as the Borough’s main civic and 
cultural hub. 
4 Transform the A21 Corridor, South Circular (A205) and the A20 by applying the Healthy Streets Approach with 
public realm improvements that make walking, cycling and the use of public transport safer and more convenient. 
Enhance the place qualities of the A21 Corridor by integrating new high quality housing development along and 
around it, and redeveloping out-of-centre retail parks and buildings for a wider mix of uses.
5 Strengthen the role of Staplehurst Road and Hither Green Lane Local Centres, and other commercial areas 
nearby, to secure their long-term vitality and viability and to make the neighbourhood more liveable. Improve 
connectivity within and through Hither Green by addressing severance caused by railways and major roads, 
including public realm enhancements at the Hither Green station approaches and their surrounds.
6 Reinforce and enhance the character of established residential areas, local centres and parades whilst delivering 
new homes and area improvements through their sensitive intensification.
7 Protect and enable the renewal of industrial land at Bromley Road. Improve the quality of the townscape around 
Bellingham local centre, particularly at Randlesdown Road and Bellingham station approach.
8 Enhance the environmental quality and amenity value of the Ravensbourne and Quaggy Rivers. Improve public 
access to the rivers with new and improved routes, focussing on Waterlink Way and Silk Mills Path.
9 Protect and enhance open and green spaces, including waterways. Deliver the Lewisham Links, a connected 
network of high quality walking routes and cycleways  that link these spaces and other key destinations.

14 LEWISHAM’S CENTRAL AREAFigure 14.2: Central Area key diagram 
444LCA1 Central Area place principles
A Development proposals must contribute to 
the delivery of Good Growth with reference 
to Policy OL1 (Delivering an Open Lewisham) 
and in doing so, demonstrate how they have 
responded positively to and will support the 
achievement of the key spatial objectives for 
the Central Area. 
B Development proposals must help to ensure 
the Central Area benefits from a high quality 
network of walking routes and cycleways that 
connect neighbourhoods and places, including 
green spaces and waterways, with reference to 
Policy GR4 (Lewisham Links).
C Staplehurst Road  and Hither Green Lane are 
designated as  Local Centres reflecting the role  
they play in the provision of local services and 
community facilities, along with their accessible 
location near Hither Green station. To help 
secure the long-term viability of the Local 
Centres, development proposals should:
a. Address severance caused by the railway 
and improve access to and along the 
station approaches and the Local Centres 
through public realm enhancements. that 
make walking routes, cycleways and station 
entrances (including at Springbank Road) 
safer and more legible;
b. Enhance the character of the Local Centres 
through shopfront improvements, tree 
planting and, where appropriate, refurbishing 
or redeveloping buildings that detract from 
local character; and 
c. Facilitate the renewal of non-designated 
employment sites in proximity to the 
station to secure a complementary mix of 
commercial and other uses.D The distinctive character of the residential 
hinterland within Catford, Lewisham and 
Hither Green will be reinforced. To help meet 
the Borough’s future needs, particularly for 
housing, sensitively designed and high quality 
development on small sites will be supported 
where this responds positively to the area’s 
local and historic character.
E The river valley network is a defining feature 
of the Central Area which development 
proposals must respond positively to by:
a. Ensuring that development is designed 
to improve the ecological quality of the 
Ravensbourne and Quaggy rivers, including 
by naturalising the rivers, wherever 
opportunities arise; 
b. Ensuring the layout and design of 
development gives prominence to the rivers 
and the river valley, and enhances their 
amenity value, including by better revealing 
them; 
c. Facilitating the provision of new and 
enhanced connections to and along 
the rivers and river valleys, including by 
extending and improving the Waterlink Way. 
Walking routes and  cycleways that enhance 
access to the river from the town centres 
of Lewisham and Catford, and the A21 
Corridor, will be strongly supported; and
d. Designing development with reference to 
the River Corridor Improvement Plan .

14 LEWISHAM’S CENTRAL AREAFigure 14.3: Central Area connections 
446LCA2 Lewisham major centre and surrounds
A Continued investment in Lewisham Major 
Centre to enable its future designation 
as a Metropolitan Centre of sub-regional 
significance in London is a strategic priority. 
To realise this objective and secure the centre’s 
long-term vitality and viability, development 
proposals must contribute to a coordinated 
process of transformational improvement to the 
town centre and its environment. They should 
deliver a complementary mix of main town uses, 
along with new housing, whilst ensuring that 
the centre’s predominant commercial role is 
maintained and enhanced. 
B Development proposals will be required to help 
facilitate, and must not prejudice, the delivery 
of transport infrastructure necessary to ensure 
the centre can effectively serve, and benefit 
from, a wider sub-regional catchment and 
to support Opportunity Area objectives. This 
includes the Bakerloo line extension, Lewisham 
station interchange, land required for bus 
services,  as well as new and improved walking 
routes and cycleways. Further requirements are 
set out in Policy TR1 (Sustainable transport and 
movement) and the site allocation policies for 
the Central Area.
C Development proposals should respond 
positively to the evolving urban character of 
the centre and its surrounds. They must be 
designed with reference to their relationship 
with existing clusters of tall and taller buildings, 
the prevailing townscape and skyline, having 
regard to Policy QD4 (Building heights). 
Development must be designed to provide 
an appropriate transition in bulk, scale, massing, height and character from residential 
neighbourhoods around the centre, the edges 
of the centre and  the centre’s commercial core, 
with generous setbacks provided along the 
Ravensbourne and Quaggy rivers, main roads 
and other corridors for movement.
D Development proposals must contribute 
to enhancing the public realm by applying 
the Healthy Streets Approach. They should 
promote and enable movement by walking, 
cycling and the use of public transport in 
order to make the town centre a significantly 
more accessible, safer, healthier and attractive 
place. This will require that a clear hierarchy of 
streets is established within the town centre 
and its surrounding neighbourhoods, along 
with a cohesive and legible network of walking 
routes and cycleways running through and/
or connecting key commercial destinations, 
public transport nodes, public open spaces and 
residential areas.  Particular consideration will 
need to be given to movements to and from 
Lewisham station interchange, connecting Silk 
Mills Path and residential neighbourhoods to 
the north, and Lewisham Gateway and the 
wider town centre area to the south.
E Development proposals must be designed to 
improve access and permeability in the town 
centre and its surrounding area, particularly 
where sites are to be delivered through 
comprehensive redevelopment. This includes 
new or enhanced east-west routes through the 
Lewisham Shopping Centre site, along Loampit 
Vale and Thurston Road, and from Silk Mills 
Path to Connington Road and Lewisham Road.
447
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
14 LEWISHAM’S CENTRAL AREAF Development proposals must maximise 
opportunities to improve the ecological quality 
and amenity value of the river environment. 
This includes improved access to the River 
Ravensbourne by extending and enhancing 
Waterlink Way that traverses the wider 
town centre area, and the River Quaggy 
at Lee High Road. Development proposals 
should make provision for attractive and 
robust embankments as an integral feature 
of the design, particularly along the River 
Ravensbourne in order to enhance connections 
from Silk Mills Path to Lewisham transport 
interchange and the Lewisham Gateway site, 
leading to the town centre and the Primary 
Shopping Area.
G Lewisham market is at the heart of the town 
centre and will be protected as an important 
commercial destination, community anchor 
and visitor attraction. Development proposals 
should assist in securing the long-term viability 
of the market by protecting and enhancing 
its amenity, delivering public realm and access 
improvements, and making provision for 
facilities for traders. Effective management of 
the market and associated public realm will 
be essential to its long-term viability, and the 
Council will work with stakeholders to secure 
appropriate management arrangements.
H Within the designated town centre area and at 
its edges, development proposals must provide 
for an appropriate mix of main town centre uses 
at the ground floor level. Retail uses should 
be concentrated within the Primary Shopping 
Area, forming the main use across the shopping 
frontages, and supported with a wider range of complementary commercial, leisure and 
cultural uses elsewhere. Evening and night-time 
economic activities will be supported where 
they contribute positively to the local area, 
with reference to Policy EC18 (Culture, creative 
industries and the night-time economy).
I Development proposals must make provision 
for positive frontages with active ground floor 
frontages  within the town centre and at its 
edges. This includes along Lewisham High 
Street, Molesworth Street, Rennell Street and 
Lewisham Grove – which together help to frame 
the Primary Shopping Area – as well as Loampit 
Vale, Lee High Road and Lewisham Road. 
Development must reinforce or create a positive 
relationship with the public realmat the street 
or ground floor level, and where appropriate 
podium levels of buildings. Where new housing 
is proposed within the town centre this will only 
be acceptable on the upper floor levels.
J To ensure Lewisham Major Centre maintains 
its role as one of the Borough’s principal 
commercial and employment locations, 
development proposals must retain or re-
provide existing workspace, and deliver net 
gains in industrial capacity wherever possible. 
A broad range of workspace typologies will be 
supported within the centre and its immediate 
surrounds, with priority given to Class E(g) uses, 
including hybrid workspace combining office 
and light industrial uses appropriate to the 
area. Provision of workspace suitable for small 
and independent businesses, including units 
of 500 square meters or less, will be strongly 
encouraged. 
448LCA3 Catford major centre and surrounds
A Reinforcing the role of Catford Major Centre 
as Lewisham’s principal civic and cultural 
hub is integral to the delivery of the spatial 
strategy. To realise this objective and to secure 
the centre’s long-term vitality and viability, 
development proposals must contribute 
to a coordinated process of town centre 
regeneration that responds positively to 
Catford’s distinctive character. They should 
deliver a complementary mix of main town 
centre uses, along with new housing, whilst 
ensuring that the centre’s predominant civic, 
commercial and cultural role is maintained and 
enhanced.
B Development proposals must be delivered 
through the masterplan process in accordance 
with the Catford Town Centre Framework and 
where appropriate, site allocation policies.
C The realignment of the South Circular (A205) 
at Catford Major Centre will be facilitated 
through the Local Plan and delivered through 
a partnership approach with Transport for 
London and other key stakeholders. The road 
realignment  will enable the comprehensive 
regeneration of the town centre and 
enhance the liveability of its surrounding 
neighbourhoods. Development proposals 
must maximise opportunities presented by the 
road realignment to make provision for safe 
movement along and across the South Circular 
and its junction at Rushey Green (A21), new 
and improved public realm and high quality, 
publicly accessible open spaces.D Development proposals should respond 
positively to the evolving urban character of 
the town centre and its immediate surrounds. 
Development must be designed to provide 
for an appropriate transition in scale, bulk, 
mass, height and character from residential 
neighbourhoods around the centre, the edges 
of the centre, and the centre’s commercial and 
civic core, with generous setbacks provided 
along the Ravensbourne River, major roads 
and other corridors for movement.
E Development proposals must contribute 
to enhancing the public realm by applying 
the Healthy Streets Approach. They should 
promote and enable movement by walking, 
cycling and the use public transport to make 
the town centre a significantly more accessible, 
safer, healthier and attractive place. This will 
require that a clear hierarchy of streets is 
established within the wider town centre area, 
along with a cohesive and legible network of 
walking routes and cycleways running through 
and/or connecting key, commercial, civic and 
cultural destinations, public transport nodes, 
public open spaces and residential areas.  
Particular consideration will need to be given 
to movements to and from Catford and Catford 
Bridge stations and along Rushey Green 
(A21). Careful consideration will also need to 
be given to the relationship between vehicular, 
pedestrian and cycle movements and access at 
Sangley, Brownhill and Plassy Roads, and the 
South Circular (A205).

a. Retaining the Broadway Theatre as an 
integral local landmark and cultural 
destination within the centre. Development 
should be designed to ensure the theatre 
remains a prominent visual feature marking 
the eastern gateway to The Broadway;
b. Designing development with reference 
to the historic fabric of the local area. 
In particular, development should seek 
opportunities to enhance the townscape 
by reinstating the network of historic lanes 
within the town centre; and
c. Addressing the relationship of new 
development with the Culvery Green 
Conservation Area to the south.
G Development proposals must respond 
positively to the distinctive character of the 
Broadway and the buildings of townscape 
merit along it.  They should reinforce and 
enhance thefunction of the Broadway as a 
key movement corridor by walking and cycling 
as well as a focal point of community and 
commercial activity.
H Development proposals must maximise 
opportunities to improve the ecological quality 
and amenity value of the river environment. 
This includes measures to deculvert and 
naturalise the River Ravensbourne near 
Catford and Catford Bridge Stations, and to improve public access to the Waterlink Way 
by repairing the existing break in the path 
and extending the route to join with the River 
Pool Linear Park. Development proposals 
should make provision for attractive and 
robust embankments as an  integral feature 
of the design to enhance connections to town 
centre’s western gateway, Ladywell Fields and 
the train stations.
I Catford market forms an integral part of 
the town centre and will be protected as an 
important commercial destination, community 
anchor and visitor attraction. Development 
proposals should assist in securing the long-
term viability of the market by protecting 
and enhancing its amenity, delivering public 
realm and access improvements, and making 
provision for facilities for traders.
J Development proposals must provide for an 
appropriate mix of main town centre uses. 
Retail uses should be concentrated within the 
Primary Shopping Area, forming the main use 
across the shopping frontages, and supported 
with a wider range of complementary 
civic, commercial, leisure and cultural uses 
elsewhere. Evening and night-time economic 
activities should help to reinforce Catford’s role 
as an important cultural destination, and will 
be supported where they contribute positively 
to the local area, with reference to Policy EC18 
(Culture, creative industries and the night-time 
economy).
450K Development proposals must make provision 
for positive frontages within the town 
centre and at its edges with active ground 
floor frontages along Rushey Green, The 
Broadway and within the Primary Shopping 
Area.. Development must reinforce or create 
a positive relationship with the public realm 
at the street or ground floor level, and where 
appropriate, podium levels of buildings.
L Catford Major Centre is a key commercial and 
employment location. It has a unique civic and 
cultural function that distinguishes it from, 
and helps to complement, Lewisham Major 
Centre. Development proposals must retain or 
re-provide existing workspace and deliver net 
gains in industrial capacity wherever possible. 
A broad range of workspace typologies 
will be supported within the centre and its 
immediate surrounds, with priority given to 
Class E(g) uses, including office floorspace 
and hybrid workspace combining office and 
lighter industrial uses appropriate to the area. 
Provision of workspace suitable for small and 
independent businesses, including units of 
500 square meters or less, will be strongly 
encouraged, particularly where the space is 
designed to support the cultural and creative 
industries.

14 LEWISHAM’S CENTRAL AREALCA4 A21 corridor 
A The transformation of the A21 Corridor 
(Lewisham High Street, Rushey Green and 
Bromley Road) and its immediate surrounds 
into a network of liveable and healthy 
neighbourhoods with a distinctive urban 
character is integral to the delivery of the 
spatial strategy. Development proposals 
must demonstrate how they have responded 
positively to the A21 Development Framework 
through the design-led approach.
B Development proposals along the A21 
Corridor and its immediate surrounds must 
contribute to enhancing the place qualities of 
the corridor by:
a. Responding positively to the evolving urban 
character of the area through the sensitive 
intensification of sites, where appropriate;
b. Helping to establish a distinctive and legible 
urban grain along and around the Corridor, 
including clusters of development of an 
urban scale situated at major road junctions;
c. Ensuring new development reinforces 
or creates a positive relationship with 
the public realm, including through the 
provision of positive frontages along the 
Corridor, and active ground floor frontages 
incorporating commercial and community 
uses, where appropriate, particularly in town 
centres and edge-of-centre locations; 
d. Maximising opportunities to integrate 
tree planting and other urban greening 
measures; ande. Enhancing connections between the Major 
Centres of Catford and Lewisham, as well as 
neighbourhoods surrounding the Corridor, 
through the delivery of new and improved 
public realm.
C Development proposals must reinforce and 
enhance the role of the A21 as a strategic 
movement corridor by applying the Healthy 
Streets Approach. This principal north-
south route should be supported by a 
complementary network of legible, safe and 
accessible walking routes and cycleways that 
link with it to enhance connections between 
neighbourhoods and places, including open 
spaces such as Ladywell Fields, Lewisham Park, 
Mountsfield Park and the River Ravensbourne. 
D Development proposals should investigate 
and maximise opportunities to reinstate or 
enhance the network of finer grain east-west 
connections for walking and cycling to and 
from the A21 Corridor, and the river valley, 
particularly where sites are to be delivered 
through comprehensive redevelopment.
45214.9 Lewisham’s Central Area features the linked but 
complementary Major Centres of Lewisham and 
Catford. These centres together with the A21 
road make up a strategic growth corridor within 
the Borough. A London Plan Opportunity Area 
broadly covers the extent of this corridor. To fully 
realise the growth potential of the Opportunity 
Area it is vital that the regeneration and renewal 
of the Major Centres is delivered and new 
transport infrastructure is secured, including the 
Bakerloo line extension and upgrade of Lewisham 
interchange, which is one of London’s main 
strategic transport interchanges. .
14.10 The regeneration and renewal of Lewisham Major 
Centre, enabling its transition to a Metropolitan 
Centre, is a key Local Plan objective which is 
supported by the London Plan. A significant 
amount of investment has been directed to 
the town centre in recent years. This reflects 
the strong commitment by the Council and 
other stakeholders to deliver a high quality, 
modern Metropolitan Centre. A number of 
major developments have been consented or 
completed, bringing a significant amount of new 
homes, business space and community facilities 
to the centre together with public realm and 
environmental improvements. This includes the 
removal and reconfiguration of the gyratory at 
Lewisham Gateway and river restoration works. 
There remain opportunities for additional sites to 
come forward whose redevelopment will enhance 
the function and place qualities of the centre. Lewisham Shopping Centre is noteworthy given 
the size of the site and its prominent position 
at the heart of the centre. Its redevelopment is 
essential to improving access and permeability 
within and through the centre as well as to 
enhance the amenity of Lewisham market, an 
important visitor destination in its own right.
14.11 Catford Major Centre is the civic heart of the 
Borough where the Council’s main offices 
are located. It contains a number of historic 
buildings including civic and cultural venues, 
such as Broadway Theatre, which give it a 
distinctive character and identity. The town 
centre has a growing evening and night-time 
economy along with a range of shops and 
services, including the Catford market, which 
cater to the daily needs of local residents. 
However, the centre suffers from areas of 
poorer quality public realm, particularly around 
the South Circular which acts as a barrier 
to movement and segregates the centre 
from its surrounding neighbourhoods. The 
realignment of the road is critical to enable 
the comprehensive regeneration of the town 
centre. This will bring substantial public benefits 
including a significant amount of new housing 
and business space along with a revitalised 
centre. To help inform the Local Plan and 
support its implementation, the Council has 
prepared the Catford Town Centre Framework.Lewisham’s Central Area
453
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
14 LEWISHAM’S CENTRAL AREA14.12 There are opportunities to enhance the liveability 
of Hither Green by reinforcing and strengthening 
the role of its Local Centres at Staplehurst Road 
and Hither Green Lane. This can in turn help 
to attract new investment to this part of the 
neighbourhood. The long-term viability and 
vitality of the centres can be supported by access 
and public realm improvements, particularly 
around Hither Green station and its western 
approaches. The railway and major roads present 
barriers to movement within and through the 
local area, including to open spaces such as 
Mountsfield Park and the River Quaggy at Manor 
Park.
14.13 An effective and resilient transport network 
is essential to the achievement of inclusive, 
healthy and liveable neighbourhoods. There are 
a number of strategic transport schemes within 
the Central Area which will help to support the 
levels of growth planned both in Lewisham and 
across London. This includes the Bakerloo line 
extension and the Lewisham station interchange. 
Along with securing these public transport 
projects the Local Plan seeks to deliver a well-
integrated network of high quality walking 
routes and cycleways to promote and enable 
modal shift away from cars. The transformation 
of the A21 Corridor using the Healthy Streets 
Approach is integral to the delivery of the 
spatial strategy. The A21 Corridor is the principal 
north-south route within Lewisham, linking 
the major centres of Lewisham and Catford as 
well as neighbourhoods further south along 
Bromley Road. It has significant potential 
for accommodating growth and improving connections between neighbourhoods and 
places, including open spaces such as Ladywell 
Fields, Lewisham Park, Mountsfield Park and the 
River Ravensbourne.
14.14 Transport for London has completed an Outcome 
Definition study along the A21. This shows 
that significant improvements are needed to 
encourage and enable modal shift, including 
improved cycle infrastructure, bus priority 
measures and additional pedestrian crossings. 
Although projects are subject to Government 
funding, any developments or future plans in 
the area should support this. Providing clear 
connections and routes on side streets off the 
A21 will be key to ensure that the area can cope 
with the increased demand, and to improve the 
links between Lewisham and Catford. 
14.15 The river corridor network is a defining feature of 
the Central Area, with the Rivers Ravensbourne 
and Quaggy traversing it. There are opportunities 
to improve the ecological quality and amenity 
value of the waterways, both by naturalising 
rivers and enhancing public access to them. 
The comprehensive redevelopment of sites 
within and around Lewisham and Catford Major 
Centres have significant potential in this respect. 
The Lewisham Links are a connected network 
of walking routes and cycleways centred on 
the network of green infrastructure, including 
waterways. Development proposals must support 
the delivery of the Lewisham Links, particularly 
by enhancing public access to and along the 
Waterlink Way.

intensification, along with the introduction of a 
wider range of uses, will provide a more optimal 
use of land to support the long-term vitality 
and viability of the town centre, and help it to 
achieve Metropolitan Centre status. Development 
will also enable public realm and environmental 
improvements, with key opportunities to 
reinstate the Rivers Quaggy and Ravensbourne 
and to create a more coherent network of 
walking routes and cycleways connecting to the 
surrounding area. 
459
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
14 LEWISHAM’S CENTRAL AREA14.23 Development requirements
1. Development must improve access to and 
permeability across the wider town centre area. 
This includes continued improvements to provide 
a legible and safe network of walking routes and 
cycleways to create a direct link between the 
station and town centre, as well as enhanced 
connections between public spaces and 
surrounding neighbourhoods.
2. Applicants must work in partnership with 
Transport for London to deliver the road 
realignment, encompassing parts of Lewisham 
High Street, Rennell Street, Molesworth Street 
and Loampit Vale.
3. Development must not prejudice the delivery 
of transport infrastructure. Proposals will be 
required to safeguard land necessary to secure 
the delivery of enhancements to the station 
interchange in order to improve passenger 
movement and connections between buses, 
trains, the Docklands Light Rail, and the future 
Bakerloo line extension.
4. Positive frontages along main roads and key 
routes, with active ground floor frontages. 
5. Delivery of new and improved public realm and 
open space in accordance with a site-wide public 
realm strategy, including:
a. A programme of river restoration, including 
channel re-profiling, to improve the ecological 
quality of the water environment and enhance 
the amenity provided by the Rivers Quaggy 
and Ravensbourne, along with Waterlink 
Way, taking into account the River Corridor 
Improvement Plan SPD; 
b. A central landscaped open space that 
celebrates the confluence of the rivers Quaggy 
and Ravensbourne. 14.24 Development guidelines
1. The design of development should set out and 
reinforce a clear hierarchy of streets and building 
heights, both within the site and in response to 
the wider town centre area, organised around a 
high quality public realm.
2. Buildings should provide for a range of footprint 
sizes to accommodate a variety of town centre, 
commercial and community uses, and be 
designed to provide flexibility to enable sub-
division of units.
3. High quality public realm must be fully integrated 
into the site area. Particular attention should 
be given to key walking routes, including the 
connections between the station interchange 
and High Street to the south, linking Lewisham 
Gateway to the heart of the town centre. 
Proposals should also be designed having 
regard to their relationship with adjoining sites, 
including those at Loampit Vale to the east and 
Conington Road to the north.
4. The Rivers Quaggy and Ravensbourne pass 
through the site but are culverted and canalised. 
Proposals will be expected to investigate and 
maximise opportunities to reinstate the rivers 
and their corridors as a prominent feature 
in the development, along with facilitating 
improvements to Waterlink Way. This should be 
supported by delivery of a new coherent public 
open space which focuses on the confluence of 
the rivers.
5. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
4606. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water. Given the adjacent watercourse, 
surface water should not be discharged to the 
public network.
7. Development must respond positively to the 
St Stephen’s and Belmont Conservation Areas, 
and the St Stephen’s Church (Grade II). Clear 
visual links to the church, situated to the east 
of the site boundary, should be established and 
maintained.

based layout with new and improved routes, both 
into and through the site, along with public realm 
and environmental enhancements.
Opportunities
14.28 This site forms the heart of Lewisham major 
centre and includes the Lewisham Market. It 
is dominated by the shopping centre, built in 
the 1970s, and the Lewisham House office 
block. Comprehensive redevelopment of the 
shopping centre, alongside the delivery of a 
significant amount of new housing on upper 
floors will enhance the quality of town centre 
and help it to achieve Metropolitan centre status. 
Redevelopment will provide opportunities to deliver modern retail and employment space, 
leisure, cultural and community facilities, to 
support the long-term vitality and viability of 
the town centre. Development can also enable 
transformative public realm enhancements to 
improve connections throughout the wider town 
centre area, and secure the long-term future of 
the market.
14.29 Development requirements
1. Landowners must work in partnership and n 
accordance with a masterplan, to ensure the 
appropriate co-ordination, phasing and balance 
of uses across the site, in line with Policy DM3 
(Masterplans and comprehensive development).
2. The site must be re-integrated with the 
surrounding street network to improve access 
and permeability into and through the town 
centre, with enhanced walking and cycle 
connections. This will require significant 
reconfiguration and re-orientation of the existing 
buildings and spaces to achieve a hierarchy of 
routes with clearly articulated east-west and 
north-south corridors together with a high 
quality market area.
3. Development must be designed to improve 
connections through the site including the 
creation of new east-west connections between 
Molesworth Street and Lewis Grove, along with 
a new north-south pedestrianised spine running 
through the site, linking the Lewisham Gateway 
site from Rennall Street at the north to Lewisham 
High Street / Molesworth Street at the south.

a. Improvements to Lewisham High Street and 
Market square. 
b. A central landscaped open space
c. A network of connections linking to the wider 
town centre area, including Cornmill Gardens, 
the Rivers Quaggy and Ravensbourne, and 
Blackheath, taking into account the River 
Corridor Improvement Plan SPD.
6. Protect and enhance Lewisham market.
7. Provision of dedicated public toilets appropriate 
to the scale of development.  
14.30 Development guidelines
1. Positive and active ground floor frontages should 
be an integral element of the development 
design. They should be accommodated adjacent 
to Lewis Grove and along the new north-south 
route through the site from Lewisham Gateway, 
including the junction with Molesworth Street 
to the south, as well as along Rennell Street and 
Molesworth Street.
2. A range of design treatments should be 
integrated along key routes to help activate 
frontages and create visual interest, including 
high quality shopfronts, building entrances and 
windows at the street level. Breaks should also 
be provided along the length of routes by the 
introduction of footpaths and amenity spaces, 
along with the interspersing of smaller business 
units.    
3. High quality public realm must be fully integrated 
into the site area. Particular attention should be 
given to key pedestrian locations, including at 
the High Street, Market Square and Molesworth 
Street. Public realm should also help to enhance connections to the wider town centre area, 
including Cornmill Gardens, the Rivers Quaggy 
and Ravensbourne, and Blackheath. 
4. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
5. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable and ensure infrastructure upgrades 
are delivered ahead of the site being occupied 
through a housing phasing plan.  Given the 
adjacent watercourse, surface water should 
not be discharged to the public network. New 
connections into the Lewisham High Street trunk 
sewer will not be allowed.
6. The site’s relationship with the Lewisham Market 
and Market Square should be one of the principal 
considerations in the development design.
7. The design of development must respond 
positively to a site’s position in the wider site 
allocation area, and to the scale and function 
of the High Street. The southern end of the site 
should operate as a transitional zone with more 
moderately scaled development. Comprehensive 
redevelopment, including the Beatties Building 
and Model Market, should encourage visitors into 
the heart of the town centre, and help to support 
pedestrian movement up the length of the High 
Street. Tall buildings  may be appropriate across 
the site, especially at the northern end of the site 
and to the west along Molesworth Street.
8. Buildings should provide for a range of footprint 
sizes to accommodate a variety of town centre, 
commercial and community uses, and be 
designed to provide flexibility to enable sub-
division of units.
4649. Development must respond positively to heritage 
assets including: The Clock Tower, Lewisham High 
Street (Grade II); Church of St Saviour and St 
John Baptist and Evangelist (RC), Lewisham High 
Street (Grade II); Former Prudential Buildings, 
187-197 Lewisham High Street (Grade II); and St 
Stephen’s Conservation Area. 
10. The eastern boundary of the St Stephen’s 
Conservation Area runs along Lewisham High 
Street, opposite the northern portion of the 
site. Proposals must address impacts on the 
significance of this heritage asset and its setting, 
including the impact on views from within the 
Conservation Area.
11. The Grade II Listed Clocktower should remain 
discernible and continue to function as a 
significant landmark and way finding feature.
12. Redevelopment options for the plots of land that 
do not fall within the ownership of the Lewisham 
Shopping Centre  should be explored, to better 
integrate them into a comprehensive scheme for 
the wider site allocation. This includes retail units 
along Lewisham High Street, and the Lewisham 
House block where the principle of land use 
has already been established through the prior 
approval process.

Ravensbourne and public access to Waterlink Way.
Opportunities
14.32 This site occupies an important transitional 
position leading into the heart of Lewisham major 
centre from the south, with frontages along the 
western side of the High Street and locally listed 
villas.  Redevelopment and site intensification will 
provide a more optimal use of land to support the 
long-term vitality and viability of the town centre. 
Redevelopment will also enable public realm and 
access improvements, particularly around the 
River Ravensbourne, enhancing the site’s qualities 
as a gateway to the centre. 
14.33 Development requirements
1. Development must be delivered in accordance 
with the A21 Development Framework and taking 
into account the River Corridor Improvement Plan 
SPD.
2. Positive frontages along Lewisham High Street, 
with active ground floor frontages.
3. Development will be required to retain or re-
provide the existing employment floorspace, 
currently situated to the west of Engate Street, 
and must not result in a net loss of industrial 
capacity.
4. Development must be designed to enhance the 
ecological quality and amenity value of the River 
Ravensbourne. 
5. Delivery of new and improved public realm, in 
accordance with a site-wide public realm strategy 
including enhanced public access to Waterlink 
Way.14.34 Development guidelines
1. The development design must respond to the site’s 
position relative to the wider town centre area. 
The site should function as a transitional zone into 
the centre, with moderately scaled development 
stepping up from Lewisham High Street.
2. Development should enhance the continuity of the 
frontages along the High Street.
3. Site redevelopment presents an opportunity to 
improve legibility and access to Waterlink Way at 
the northern part of the site. Proposals should also 
investigate opportunities to introduce a new east-
west link through the site from the High Street to 
Waterlink Way and the River Ravensbourne. 
4. Development should improve opportunities for 
walking, cycling and other active travel modes, 
contributing to the A21 Healthy Streets Corridor. 
Development should not result in a reduction in 
existing footway or carriageway space.
5. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against flood 
risk.
6. Applicants should work in partnership with Thames 
Water and engage with them early to minimise 
impacts on groundwater, manage surface water, 
divert existing sewers where applicable and ensure

plan.  Given the adjacent watercourse, surface 
water should not be discharged to the public 
network. 
7. Proposals should be designed having regard to 
the Lewisham Shopping Centre site, to ensure 
continuity of the High Street and a coordinated 
approach to public realm.
8. Proposals should have regard for the locally listed 
villas and seek to enhance their setting.

14.39 This site occupies an important transitional 
position from the surrounding residential area 
leading into the heart of Lewisham major centre 
from the north, adjacent to the Lewisham 
interchange. The River Ravensbourne runs 
along and through the site. The site is currently 
dominated by a fragmented series of car 
parks. Comprehensive redevelopment and site

14.46 Safeguarding for strategic transport 
infrastructure.
Opportunities
14.47 The site is located within Lewisham major centre 
on Thurston Road, running along the southern 
edge of the railway line.  It is currently used as a 
TFL bus station.  Transport for London proposals 
for the extension of the Bakerloo Line provide 
for the possibility of infrastructure requirements 
at this site, including a new ‘station box’. In 
March 2021 the Secretary of State issued a 
Safeguarding Direction for the BLE and this site 
has been identified as an area of surface interest, 
i.e. to be used as a temporary works site during 
the construction phase of the BLE. It may also 
be used as a temporary works site whilst making 
improvements to Lewisham Railway Station. In 
the longer term there will be an opportunity to 
re-provide the bus station. 
14.48 Development requirements
1. Applicants must consult with Transport for 
London and Network Rail to ensure this site 
makes appropriate provision for transport 
infrastructure and services.
2. The site is safeguarded as a temporary works 
site in order to deliver strategic transport 
infrastructure, including the BLE station box and 
improvements to Lewisham Railway Station.
3. The existing bus standing capacity and 
associated facilities must be temporarily re-
located.
4. Once the site has stopped being used as a 
temporary works site, it must be returned to its 
original use as a bus station for TFL. 14.49 Development guidelines
1. The design of any station improvements and/
or new BLE entrances should carefully consider 
TFL requirements regarding bus standing 
and associated facilities. The designs should, 
wherever possible minimise land take to ensure 
the site can be returned to its original use.
2. Any new station entrance should link into the 
provision made at Lewisham Exchange.

14.50 DC/16/097629 - Comprehensive redevelopment 
of the Lewisham Retail Park and Nos. 66 – 76 
Loampit Vale including the demolition of all 
buildings on site to facilitate the provision of 
4,343sqm of non-residential floorspace comprising 
(A1) Shops, (A2) Financial & Professional Services, 
(A3) Restaurants & Cafés, (B1) Business, (D1) 
Non-Residential Institutions and (D2) Assembly & 
Leisure uses and 536 residential units in buildings 
ranging from 4 – 24 storeys in height with private 
and communal open spaces, on-site energy centre, 
car and cycle parking, and associated landscaping 
and public realm works.
Site allocation
Mixed-use redevelopment with compatible main 
town centre, commercial and residential uses. 
Public realm enhancements, including a boulevard 
along Loampit Vale, with improved walking and 
cycle routes connecting to Lewisham interchange.
Opportunities
14.51 The site is located within Lewisham major centre 
on Loampit Vale, a main approach to the heart of 
the town centre from the west. The site is currently 
occupied by a warehouse with large format retail 
units and a car park, a community artist-led studio 
and project space along with a small terrace 
of seven properties. Redevelopment and site 
intensification, along with the introduction of a 
wider range of uses, will provide a more optimal 
use of land to support the long-term vitality and 
viability of the town centre. Redevelopment will 
also enable public realm and access improvements, 
better connecting the site to its immediate 
surrounds as well as enhancing access to Lewisham 
interchange.14.52 Development requirements
1. Landowners must work in partnership and in 
accordance with a masterplan, to ensure the 
appropriate co-ordination, phasing and balance 
of uses across the site, in line with Policy DM3 
(Masterplans and comprehensive development) . 
2. Development must not prejudice the delivery of 
transport infrastructure, including the Bakerloo 
Line extension.
3. The site must be re-integrated with the 
surrounding street network to improve access 
and permeability into and through the town 
centre, with enhanced connections to Lewisham 
interchange. This will require a hierarchy of routes 
with clearly articulated east-west and north-
south corridors, including walking and cycle 
friendly boulevards along Loampit Vale, Jerrard 
Street and Thurston Road.
4. Positive frontages with active ground floor 
frontages along key routes.
5. Delivery of new and improved public realm in 
accordance with a site-wide public realm strategy, 
including a new station square. 
14.53 Development guidelines
1. The design of development should respond 
positively to the importance of Loampit Vale 
as a major route, and provide an appropriate 
transition in bulk, scale and massing, towards 
Lewisham Gateway. 
2. Development should set out and reinforce a 
clear hierarchy of streets and building heights, 
both within the site and in response to the wider 
town centre area. A landmark or way finding 
building signalling the entrance to Lewisham 
town centre from Loampit Vale to the west may 
be acceptable.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
14 LEWISHAM’S CENTRAL AREA3. Tree lined pavements of a generous width, 
indicatively a minimum 6 metres, should define 
boulevards at Loampit Vale and Thurston 
Road with buildings set back at an appropriate 
distance.
4. Development should improve opportunities for 
walking, cycling and other active travel modes, 
contributing to the Healthy Streets Corridor 
between Lewisham and Deptford. Development 
should not result in a reduction in existing 
footway, cycle lane or carriageway space along 
Jerrard Street and Thurston Road.Development 
should be designed having regard to the 
Lewisham Exchange site to ensure continuity of 
the boulevards along Loampit Vale and Thurston 
Road, and a coordinated approach to public 
realm and access. This includes provision of a 
new ‘station square’ to create a coherent public 
space and visual link between the sites.
5. Transport for London proposals for the extension 
of the Bakerloo line through Lewisham 
town centre could have an impact on the 
redevelopment potential of both the Lewisham 
Retail Park and Carpetright sites. This is as a 
result of new tunnels running underneath and 
the possibility of a new ‘station box’ being 
located partly on the bus layover site (to the 
north of the Carpetright site), and across a 
portion of the northern part of the Carpetright 
site. The bus layover site has been identified 
as the preferred location for the proposed 
extension.6. Building lines may need to be set back to 
accommodate a dedicated bus lane for turning 
from Loampit Vale into Jerrard Street and the 
resultant depth of pavement.
7. Consideration should be given to the proximity 
of the proposed ‘bus layover’ site (part of the 
Lewisham Gateway development) when planning 
for sensitive uses on adjacent sites.
8. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water to minimise impacts on 
groundwater, manage surface water, divert 
existing sewers where applicable, allow access 
for maintenance and repair of sewers and ensure 
infrastructure upgrades are delivered ahead of 
the site being occupied. New connections into 
the trunk sewer will not be allowed.

14.54 Mixed-use redevelopment incorporating main 
town centre, commercial and residential uses. 
Opportunities
14.55 The site is located at the edge of Lewisham 
major town centre and occupies a transitional 
position at Loampit Vale leading to the station 
interchange. The site is currently used for MOT 
services. Redevelopment and site intensification, 
along with introduction of more compatible main 
town centre uses, will provide a more optimal 
use of land to support the long-term vitality 
and viability of the town. Development will also 
deliver design and public realm improvements 
that better complement the neighbouring 
properties.
14.56 Development requirements
1. Positive frontages along Loampit Vale, with 
active ground floor frontages.
2. Development must respond to the site’s 
transitional position at the edge of the town 
centre, and be designed to maintain and enhance 
the continuity of the building line to the west of 
the railway.
3. The maximum viable amount of employment 
floorspace must be re-provided, in line with 
Policy EC8 (Non-designated employment sites).
4. Development proposals must protect and seek to 
enhance green infrastructure, including the SINC 
adjacent to the site. 14.57 Development guidelines
1. The replacement provision of employment 
floorspace should be compatible with the 
neighbouring properties and the edge of centre 
location (previous B1 use class).
2. The site presents an opportunity for a moderately 
scaled development to act as a visual transition 
to the town centre where taller buildings 
are located. The new building line should be 
consistent with and enhance the townscape, 
positively responding to the terraces to the west 
of the railway.
3. Development may step up along Loampit Vale 
towards the railway embankment, where massing 
should be concentrated, particularly to minimise 
impact on the properties north and west.
4. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
5. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable, allow access for maintenance and 
repair of sewers and ensure infrastructure 
upgrades are delivered ahead of the site being 
occupied through a housing phasing plan. New 
connections into the Bell Green trunk sewer will 
not be allowed.
4806. Design should ensure that amenity of 
neighbouring properties, including the adjoining 
public house and gardens, is protected, in line 
with the Agent of Change principle. 
7. Development will be expected to conserve 
and enhance the setting of the Tabernacle, 
at Algernon Road, which is a Grade II listed 
building. It is clearly visible from Loampit Hill 
and stands out as a local landmark, as helps to 
function as a wayfinder.
8. The presence of the railway embankment and 
viaduct will require buildings to be set away to 
the east of the site.

complementary to the historic civic character of 
the immediate context. The historic roofscape 
including the Baths, St Mary’s church, and 
the Coroners court will be expected to remain 
dominant in the townscape and skyline. 
2. Development proposals should seek 
opportunities to incorporate flexible space, which 
could be used as community space.
3. Development should enhance permeability and 
connections between green/open spaces and 
town centres. Development on Ladywell Road 
should help to encourage activity between 
Ladywell Village and Lewisham High Street. 
4. The layout of the site should protect the 
amenity of Waterlink Way and enable access to 
it. Waterway Link runs through the site, from 
Ladywell Fields in the west, along the site’s 
southern boundary with St Mary’s Church, then 
northwards through the site, then along Wearside 
Road to the north of the site and through to 
Lewisham town centre.
5. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
6. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable, ensure infrastructure upgrades are 
delivered ahead of the site being occupied 
through a housing phasing plan and minimise the 
risk of flooding or surcharging when emptying 
swimming pools into the public sewer.

trees to be retained and replaced. Landscaping 
should form an integral part of the overall design. 
8. Development should maximise opportunities for 
historical interpretation. 
9. Large properties exist on either side of the site 
and there are terraced residential properties on 
the opposite side of Ladywell Road.  To the west 
of the site is Ladywell Fields, a public open space 
designated as Metropolitan Open Land, Green 
Corridor and a Site of Importance for Nature 
Conservation.  To the south of the site, the 
grounds of St Mary’s church are also designated 
as Metropolitan Open Land, Green Corridor and a

14.80 The site is located within Lewisham major centre 
and comprises the former Ladywell Leisure 
Centre and the land adjoining it. Part of the site 
fronting the High Street has been occupied by 
a meanwhile use, known as PLACE/Ladywell, 
consisting of a modular building integrating 24 
residential units and workspace. This building is 
to be demounted and re-located elsewhere in the 
Borough. Redevelopment and site intensification, 
along with the introduction of a wider range of 
uses, will provide a more optimal use of land

to appropriate re-provision of community 
infrastructure within the locality, in line with 
Policy CI1 (Safeguarding and securing community 
infrastructure).
4. The layout and design of development must 
respond positively to the housing estate 
immediately adjacent the site to the east, as well 
as the surrounding residential area. Development 
should support the delivery of a cohesive urban 
form and grain, with a clearly articulated network 
of routes across the site to improve permeability.
5. Delivery of new and improved public realm in 
accordance with a site-wide public realm strategy, 
including enhancements along the High Street.
14.82 Development guidelines
1. Development should set out and reinforce a clear 
hierarchy of streets, routes and building heights, 
both within the site and in response to the 
adjacent network of residential streets.
2. Development should improve opportunities for 
walking, cycling and other active travel modes, 
contributing to the A21 Healthy Streets Corridor. 
Development should not result in a reduction in

Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
4. Residential ground floor frontages may be 
acceptable away from the High Street including 
at Longbridge Way.
5. The site is adjacent to St Mary’s Conservation 
Area. Proposals will need to consider impacts

centre, at its northernmost point along Rushey 
Green. It is currently occupied by single storey 
retail building and car park and surrounded by an 
established residential area to the north, south 
and west. Comprehensive redevelopment and site 
intensification, along with the introduction of a 
wider range of uses, can deliver a more optimal 
use of land to support the long-term vitality 
and viability of the town centre. Redevelopment 
can also enable public realm and access

centre.
14.97 Development requirements
1. Development must be delivered in accordance 
the A21 Development Framework.
2. Positive frontages along Rushey Green and 
Bradgate Road, with active ground floor 
frontages on Rushey Green.
14.98 Development guidelines
1. Development should clearly define the edge of 
the A21 corridor with a well-integrated building 
line.
2. The existing frontage along Rushey Green 
should be re-designed as an active frontage that 
interfaces more positively with the adjoining 
public realm, marking the site as a transition 
point into Catford town centre.3. Development should ensure that town centres 
uses (such as bars, restaurants, take-aways) do 
not impact on local amenity, in line with policy 
EC18 H and K Culture, creative industries and the 
night-time economy.
4. Development should improve walking, cycling 
and other active travel modes, contributing to 
the A21 Healthy Streets corridor. Development 
should not result in a reduction in existing 
footway or carriageway space.
5. Whilst the residential character and scale of 
Bradgate Road should be acknowledged in 
massing along the northern boundary, the 
width of the A21 offers an opportunity for more 
moderately scaled development, subject to 
amenity considerations. 
6. Development  should be designed to protect the 
amenity of properties at Bradgate Road to the 
north, Patrol Place and Wildfell Road to the south 
and Scrooby Street to the west, having regard 
to the Agent of Change principle and policy 
QD10 (Infill and backland sites, garden land and

Opportunities
14.100 This site forms the heart of Catford major centre. 
It is key to the transformation of Catford and will 
act as a major catalyst for local area regeneration, 
as part of a comprehensive masterplan 
framework incorporating a number of key sites. 
It encompasses land to the rear of Rushey Green 
and Catford Broadway, and is bounded to the 
north and west by Holbeach Road and Thomas’ 
Lane, which provides pedestrian and vehicular 
access. The site is currently dominated by Milford 
Towers, residential blocks above a multi-storey 
car park, and ground floor retail units of various 
sizes, including a large format supermarket. 
Catford Market is located along the Broadway. 
Comprehensive redevelopment will deliver a 
significant amount of new housing together 
with modern retail (including a replacement 
large supermarket) and employment space, 
leisure, community and cultural facilities to 
support the long-term vitality and viability of 
the town centre, and reinforce its role as a civic 
and cultural hub. Development will also enable 
transformative public realm improvements to 
provide new and enhanced connections to and 
through the area.14.101 Development requirements
1. Development must be delivered in accordance 
with the Catford Town Centre Framework.
2. Access, servicing and public realm improvements 
must complement and integrate with measures 
set out in the A21 Development Framework.
3. The site must be e-integrated with the 
surrounding street network to improve access and 
permeability into and through the town centre. 
This will require significant reconfiguration, re-
orientation and re-planning of existing buildings 
and spaces to achieve a hierarchy of routes with 
clearly articulated east-west and north-south 
corridors.
4. Positive frontages with active ground floor 
frontages within the Primary Shopping Area and 
along key routes. 
5. Protect and enhance Catford market.
6. Delivery of new and improved public realm in 
accordance with a site-wide public realm strategy, 
including:
a. Improvements to Catford Broadway
b. Improvements to Rushey Green 
c. Provision of a new public open space to 
support the scale of development.
14.102 Development guidelines
1. It is important that development is designed to 
improve walking links through the site to Catford 
Broadway and Rushey Green. Routes should form 
part of and integrate with a network of new and 
existing connections to other key sites as well as 
to Catford and Catford Bridge stations.
2. Development should improve opportunities for 
walking, cycling and other active travel modes, 
contributing to the A21 Healthy Streets Corridor. 
Development should not result in a reduction in 
existing footway or carriageway space.

14 LEWISHAM’S CENTRAL AREA3. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
4. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable and ensure infrastructure upgrades 
are delivered ahead of the site being occupied 
through a housing phasing plan. Splitting flows 
across various connection points may be required 
as the existing network consists of small diameter 
pipes. An existing drainage plan should be 
submitted to aid in assessing pipe capacity. 
5. Building heights, scale and massing should 
provide for an appropriate transition from the 
perimeter of the site and its surrounds.
6. Buildings should provide for a range of footprint 
sizes to accommodate a variety of town centre, 
commercial and community uses, including a 
replacement large supermarket, and be designed 
to provide flexibility to enable sub-division of 
units.
7. Active or animated frontages should be 
integrated on all main routes around and through 
the site, and within buildings that address the 
street, including at Thomas’ Lane and Holbeach 
Road.
8. Development must make appropriate provision 
for and enhance Catford Market, with public 
realm treatments to generate visual interest and 
attract footfall.

Site allocation
14.105 Comprehensive mixed-use redevelopment 
with compatible main town centre, community 
and residential uses. Redevelopment and 
reconfiguration of the majority of buildings 
and spaces to facilitate the realignment of the 
A205 South Circular and associated public realm 
enhancements, including new public open space, 
improved walking and cycle routes, and vehicular 
access.
Opportunities
14.106 The ‘island’ is formed by the A21/A205 gyratory 
system, which separates the site from the heart 
of the town centre. It is currently occupied by 
large format retail park buildings and car parking, 
a timber yard, and shop units fronting Brownhill 
Road and Rushey Green (A21). Eros House is located at its northwest corner. Comprehensive 
redevelopment and site intensification, along 
with the introduction of a wider range of uses, 
will provide a more optimal use of land to 
support the long-term vitality and viability of 
the town centre. Redevelopment can also enable 
public realm and access improvements, better 
connecting the site to its immediate surrounds 
and enhancing its function as the southeast 
gateway to the town centre.
14.107 Development requirements
1. Development must be delivered in accordance 
with the Catford Town Centre Framework, and 
integrate with the measures set out in the A21 
Development Framework.
2. Development must not prejudice the delivery of 
transport infrastructure, including public realm 
enhancements associated with the re-alignment 
of the A205. The siting of buildings must ensure 
the traffic and transport improvements along the 
South Circular at Sangley Road, Plassy Road and 
Brownhill Roads can be implemented in full.
3. The site must be re-integrated with the 
surrounding street network to improve access 
and permeability in the local area, and to better 
integrate the site with the Primary Shopping 
Area. This will require a hierarchy of routes with 
clearly articulated east-west and north-south 
corridors.
4. Positive frontages with active ground floor 
frontages along key routes.
5. Delivery of new and improved public realm in 
accordance with a site-wide public realm strategy. 
This must integrate provision of new public open 
space appropriate to the scale of development.
50414.108 Development guidelines
1. In order to optimise the site’s capacity, and 
to ensure a more complementary fit with the 
prevailing urban grain, ‘out of centre’ style 
low-density large format units or warehouses 
will be resisted. Development should create a 
positive relationship with the planned changes 
to and realignment of the South Circular, with 
active ground floor frontages complemented by 
appropriate buffers and set back distances.
2. Retail and commercial elements should reflect 
the site’s immediate town centre context, 
providing a mix of unit sizes and workspaces to 
support a wide range of uses and businesses.
3. The layout and design of development should 
clearly articulate and improve the boundaries of 
the site. Public realm, landscaping and buildings 
should be well integrated and function to both 
define and overlook walking routes within and 
adjacent to the site.
4. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
5. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable, allow access for maintenance and 
repair of sewers and ensure infrastructure 
upgrades are delivered ahead of the site being 
occupied through a housing phasing plan. New 
connections into the Lewisham trunk sewer will 
not be allowed.6. The design of development should respond 
positively to the residential properties to the 
site’s east, having regard to existing townscape 
features. Tall buildings should be located centrally 
on the site and not be located along the site’s 
eastern boundary.
7. Green space across the site should contribute 
towards a network of green infrastruc-ture across 
the town centre.
8. Development should improve walking, cycling 
and other active travel modes between Sangley 
Road, the Corbett Estate and Catford Town 
Centre, contributing to the A21 Healthy Streets 
Corridor. Development should not result in a 
reduction in existing foot-way or carriageway 
space. 
9. Options for the site currently occupied by Eros 
House should be explored to better integrate it 
into a comprehensive scheme for the wider site 
allocation.

14.109 Comprehensive mixed-use development with 
compatible main town centre uses, including 
civic and cultural uses, and residential uses. 
Realignment of the A205 (South Circular) to 
facilitate town centre regeneration along with 
public realm and access improvements.
Opportunities
14.110 The site comprises the civic and cultural heart 
of Catford major town centre, with the Civic 
Suite and Lawrence House buildings along with 
the Grade II Listed Broadway Theatre. Re-
alignment of the A205 South Circular, delivered 
in partnership with Transport for London, 
will address existing issues of severance and 
pedestrian and vehicular circulation within 
the local area, and facilitate transformational 
regeneration of the town centre. The realignment 
of the A205 will deliver major public realm 
and access improvements, better linking the 
site to the rest of the town centre and wider 
neighbourhood area. Redevelopment also 
provides opportunities to deliver enhanced or 
new civic space.
14.111 Development requirements
1. To ensure comprehensive development of the 
site, proposals must be delivered in accordance 
with the Catford Town Centre Framework, and 
integrate with the measures set out in the A21 
Development Framework.
2. Provision of a mix of main town centre uses, 
incorporating civic and cultural uses.
3. Preserve or enhance the Broadway Theatre as a 
performance facility. 4. Applicants must work in partnership with 
Transport for London to deliver the realignment 
of the A205 South Circular, ensuring it is integral

5. Delivery of new and improved public realm in 
accordance with a site-wide public realm strategy, 
including public realm enhancements along 
Catford Road and Catford Broadway, with priority 
given to walking and cycle movements in order 
to improve connectivity between the site and the 
town centre to the north.
14.112 Development guidelines
1. The bulk, scale, massing and height of 
development should respond positively 
and sensitively to the site location. Careful 
consideration should be given to heritage assets 
within and adjacent to this site, including the 
Grade II listed Broadway Theatre and Culverley 
Green Conservation Area.
2. Development should be designed to protect the 
amenity of residential properties, taking into 
account the theatre’s out of hours’ access and 
servicing needs, in line with the Agent of Change 
principle.
3. The siting and design of new development 
should consider existing framed views of the 
town centre from Bromley Road.  
4. Work in partnership with Transport for London 
to deliver the realignment of the A205 
South Circular, ensuring it is integral to the 
development of the site. 
5. The layout of the site should promote green 
links, along with safe walking and cycling routes 
between Canadian Avenue and Bromley Road, 
separate from the A205.

14.113 Re-routing of the A205 South Circular.
Opportunities
14.114 The A205 South Circular currently runs to the 
north of Laurence House.  The busy and con-
gested road currently severs the Civic Centre 
area and creates a barrier to movement for 
pedestrians. Complicated road junctions and a 
lack of safe pedestrian crossing points and cycle 
lanes further exacerbate the situation.  A new 
road layout design, with Catford Road realigned 
to the south of Laurence House, provides 
an opportunity to create a much improved 
consolidated and people focused public realm 
at the heart of the revitalised town centre. The 
provision of large and flexible open spaces, 
to enhance the setting of existing and new 
buildings, could allow for a range of activities to 
take place.
14.115 Development requirements
1. The land is required for the re-routing of the 
A205 South Circular.
2. De-designation of the Metropolitan Open Land 
located within the St Dunstan’s College will be 
de-designated, and used solely for the purposes 
of re-routing the A205 South Circular. 14.116 Development guidelines
1. The re-routed A205 South Circular should enable 
better flow of pedestrians and cyclists along the 
new road.
2. Development should improve opportunities for 
walking, cycling and other active travel modes 
along A205 Catford Road, contributing to the 
A21 Healthy Streets Corridor. Development 
should not result in a reduction in existing 
footway or carriageway space.

redevelopment with compatible main town 
centre and commercial uses. Reconfiguration of 
buildings and spaces to facilitate public realm 
enhancements including new public open space, 
river restoration, improved walking and cycle 
routes and vehicular access.
Opportunities
14.118 This site is located at the western edge of Catford 
major town centre, between the Catford and 
Catford Bridge railway lines and to the south of 
the A205 South Circular. It is currently occupied 
by large format retail units with associated 
surface car parking and light industrial uses. The 
River Ravensbourne cuts diagonally through the 
site to the north in a covered channel. The town 
centre boundary will be extended to include the 
site. A more optimal use of land can be made 
through site intensification as well as enhancing 
the site’s function as the southwest gateway to 
the town centre. Redevelopment will also enable 
public realm and environmental improvements to 
be delivered, with key opportunities to reinstate 
the River Ravensbourne.14.119 Development requirements
1. Development must be delivered in accordance 
the Catford Town Centre Framework.
2. Site layout and design should improve access 
to and permeability across the wider town 
centre area, with enhanced walking and cycle 
connections to Catford and Catford Bridge 
stations and Waterlink Way.
3. A rationalised and/or re-positioned access onto 
Catford Road together with internal road layout, 
to create a safe, coherent and more legible 
vehicular access both to and through the site.
4. Positive frontages with active ground floor 
frontages on key routes where appropriate. 
Residential uses will not be acceptable on ground 
floor or basement levels due to flood risk.
5. Development must deliver public realm 
enhancements and improve the site’s relationship 
with Catford and Catford Bridge stations as well 
as the A205 South Circular.
6. Provision of new public open or green space 
around the River Ravensbourne, linking to 
Stansted Road, taking into account the River 
Corridor Improvement Plan SPD.
7. Retention of the Old Pumping Station located at 
the southern end of the site.
8. Development proposals must conserve and seek 
to enhance green infrastructure.
51214.120 Development guidelines
1. The layout and design of development should 
clearly articulate and improve the boundaries of 
the site. Public realm, landscaping and buildings 
should be well integrated and function to both 
define and overlook walking routes within and 
adjacent to the site.
2. Innovative design solutions will be needed to 
overcome the level differences between the 
site and its surrounds, particularly to create an 
attractive boundary to the South Circular and to 
take advantage of the visual amenity provided by 
the Jubilee Ground.
3. To minimise overshadowing on existing homes 
to the west, the taller elements of development 
should be located towards the eastern part of the 
site, whilst ensuring there is no adverse impact 
on the Metropolitan Open Land nearby.
4. Waterlink Way runs along the site’s western 
and northern boundaries, providing a direct 
connection to the South Circular and wider 
town centre area, and via subway to Catford and 
Catford Bridge railway stations.  Development 
should provide a contiguous link and improve 
opportunities for walking and cycling and other 
active travel modes and deliver the Greenwich to 
Kent House Cycleway along the Waterlink Way 
Development should not result in a reduction in 
existing footway or carriageway space.
5. Development should maximise opportunities 
to enhance the ecological quality and amenity 
provided by the River Ravensbourne, including 
by revealing the river through deculverting, 
repairing gaps in Waterlink Way and improving 
public access to it.6. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk, maximise opportunities for river 
restoration and protect the sensitive groundwater 
zone.
7. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable and ensure infrastructure upgrades 
are delivered ahead of the site being occupied 
through a housing phasing plan.  Given the 
adjacent watercourse, surface water should 
not be discharged to the public network. New 
connections into the trunk sewer on Catford Hill 
will not be allowed.  There are opportunities to 
daylight the Ravensbourne which is culverted on 
this site and expand the surface water network.
8. Proposals should investigate and maximise 
opportunities to facilitate links through the 
railway arches.
9. Commercial uses will be supported underneath 
the railway arches, at the western edge of the 
site, with priority given to uses that are likely to 
attract footfall to the town centre and are highly 
compatible with residential uses.

Opportunities
The site is located on Bromley Road which forms 
part of the A21 corridor. It is currently occupied 
by an out-of-centre retail park consisting of 
large format retail buildings and car parking. The 
River Ravensbourne runs along the site’s western 
boundary. Comprehensive redevelopment and 
site intensification, along with the introduction 
of a wider range of uses, will provide a more 
optimal use of land. Rationalising of the retail 
offer will support the long-term vitality and 
viability of Catford major town centre, which is 
located nearby. Re-development will also enable 
public realm enhancements, including river 
restoration works and improved access to the 
River Ravensbourne.
14.121 Development requirements
1. Development proposals must be delivered 
in accordance with the A21 Development 
Framework.
2. The site must be re-integrated with the 
surrounding street network to improve access 
and permeability into and through the site. This 
will require a hierarchy of routes with clearly 
articulated east-west and north-south corridors, 
with direct walking and cycle access to a riverside 
amenity space.
3. Positive frontages along Bromley Road and 
Aitken Road. 4. Development must be designed to improve 
the ecological quality, carbon storage, flood 
storage and public amenity value of the River 
Ravensbourne, and seek to re-naturalise the river 
where feasible, taking into account the River 
Corridor Improvement Plan SPD. 
5. Delivery of new and improved public realm in 
accordance with a site-wide public realm strategy, 
including:
a. Provision of new public open and/or green 
space, linking to Aitken Road.
b. Public open space along the river.
c. Public realm enhancements along Bromley 
Road with the retention of the current green 
space and an improved walking and cycle 
environment.
14.122 Development guidelines
1. Development should clearly define the edge of 
the A21 corridor with a well-integrated building 
line, including by extending the established 
building line to the north. 
2. Development should improve opportunities for 
walking, cycling and other active travel modes, 
contributing to the A21 Healthy Streets Corridor. 
Development should not result in a reduction in 
existing footway or carriageway space.
3. A positive frontage should be established along 
the south side of Aitken Road to create a ‘two-
sided’ street which relates sympathetically to the 
properties to the north.
4. Development should be designed so that primary 
vehicular access is from the A21 and Aitken 
Road. Opportunities should be explored to align 
the street network with Barmeston Road to 
create a contiguous layout, where this would help 
to improve circulation and not adversely impact 
on local amenity.

14 LEWISHAM’S CENTRAL AREA5. Taller buildings that help with way finding 
along the A21 corridor may be acceptable, with 
development stepping up from Bromley Road. 
Taller elements should be positioned towards 
the centre of the site to manage and mitigate 
impacts on amenity, including overshadowing, on 
the surrounding residential areas.
6. Part of the site falls within the Culverley Green 
Conservation Area, which development must 
respond to positively.
7. Buffers between the adjoining employment 
sites will need to be introduced, and where they 
are existing, enhanced. These should include 
elements of green infrastructure wherever 
feasible.
8. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
9. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable and ensure infrastructure upgrades 
are delivered ahead of the site being occupied 
through a housing phasing plan.  Given the 
adjacent watercourse, surface water should not 
be discharged to the public network.10. Commercial uses that are compatible with 
existing and new residential properties will be 
supported in principle. All such provision should 
complement existing uses at the Bromley Road 
SIL to reinforce the local node of employment 
generating activity.
11. Where main town centre uses are incorporated 
these should not adversely impact on the town 
centre network. Development will be expected 
to achieve a significant reduction in the current 
amount of retail floorspace, with replacement 
retail provision focussed on servicing the site and 
its immediate surrounds.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVEContext and character
15.1 Lewisham’s North Area contains the 
neighbourhoods of North Deptford, Deptford, 
and New Cross. The waterway network helps to 
define the area, particularly the River Thames 
that establishes its northern boundary. The River 
Ravensbourne and Deptford Creek, the latter 
forming the boundary with Royal Borough of 
Greenwich, are also prominent physical features 
and reflect the Borough’s unique Thames side 
character.
15.2 The North Area has a rich and varied historic 
environment with a number of listed buildings 
and Conservation Areas. Historic buildings 
and structures include churches, Georgian 
townhouses, Victorian terraces, industrial 
warehouses and railway viaducts. Local character 
is also strongly influenced by the historic 
Royal Dockyard and maritime industries, with 
the first residential areas developed around 
the Greenwich railway. The area was heavily 
damaged in WWII and redevelopment through 
the subsequent interwar and post-war periods 
has given rise to a mixed urban character, with a 
number of large estates featuring large plots and 
mid-rise, medium density housing, including the 
Pepys Estate.15.3 The North Area contains much of the Borough’s 
employment land stock which contributes to 
its  distinctive industrial character. There are 
employment sites situated throughout, including 
the regionally important Strategic Industrial 
Location at Surrey Canal Road and clusters 
of Locally Significant Industrial Sites around 
Deptford Creekside. Several larger industrial 
sites have recently undergone a plan-led process 
of regeneration. Continued renewal of vacant 
and underused industrial sites will influence the 
area’s evolving character whilst providing for 
new homes, jobs and community facilities along 
with environmental improvements. For example, 
planning consent has been granted for major 
mixed-use developments at Convoys Wharf and 
Surrey Canal Triangle.
15.4 The character of the North Area is also strongly 
informed by the layout of historic roads and 
railway infrastructure that dissects much of the 
area. This infrastructure contributes to severance 
and limits permeability and circulation within and 
between neighbourhoods and places. There are 
key movement corridors within the area linking 
to other parts of London, such as Surrey Canal 
Road, Evelyn Street (B200) and New Cross Road 
(A2). However these roads are dominated by 
vehicules, prone to traffic and congestion, and 
typically suffer from poorer quality public realm, 
which limits their suitability for movement by 
walking and cycling.
52015.5 The historic High Streets at Deptford and New 
Cross play a key role in shaping and reinforcing 
local character and identity. They offer provision 
of a rich and vibrant mix of shops, services and 
independent traders. Deptford market, situated 
at the heart of Deptford District Centre, is a focal 
point for community activity and a well-known 
visitor destination. New Cross District Centre is 
a vibrant town centre and thriving evening and 
night-time economy hub that serves its local 
catchment, including a large student population. 
The town centres benefit from their proximity to 
important cultural and educational institutions, 
including the Albany Theatre, Goldsmiths College 
and Trinity Laban Centre, which exert a strong 
influence over the area. These institutions play 
a critical economic role and have been vital to 
the growth of the creative and digital industries 
in the Borough. The North Area includes one of 
London’s first Creative Enterprise Zones.
15.6 The network of green infrastructure in the 
North Area, including parks, open spaces and 
waterways, are valuable natural and recreational 
assets within the predominantly urban context. 
Many newer developments have delivered 
public realm improvements, opening up access 
to and naturalising parts of Deptford Creek and 
the River Ravensbourne, as well as providing 
improved access to the River Thames. Many 
neighbourhoods however have a limited number 
of street trees and could benefit from urban 
greening.

15 LEWISHAM’S NORTH AREAVision
15.7 By 2040 the maritime and industrial heritage of 
the North area, linked to its unique position along 
the River Thames, will be celebrated as a vital focus 
for cultural activity and regeneration. The character 
and role of vacant and underused industrial sites 
around the Thames and Deptford Creek will be 
re-imagined to provide well integrated employment 
areas and mixed-use neighbourhoods. A new 
Creative Enterprise Zone will cement Lewisham’s 
position as a leader in the creative and cultural 
industries and support an inclusive local economy. 
The arrival of the Bakerloo line, with a new station 
at New Cross, will also open opportunities for 
everyone to benefit from.
15.8 The regeneration of larger brownfield sites will 
deliver a significant amount of new housing, 
including a high proportion of genuinely affordable 
housing, workspace and jobs, community facilities 
and open space. New mixed-use areas will be 
created at Convoys Wharf, the Timber Yard 
at Deptford Wharf and Surrey Canal Triangle. 
These will be well integrated with existing 
neighbourhoods and communities, including 
housing estates, ensuring all local residents 
enjoy access to decent homes, high quality living 
environments and good job opportunities. The 
historic High Streets at New Cross and Deptford 
District Centres will remain at the heart of 
community activity, reflecting the area’s culture 
and diversity. The centres will form an integral 
part of the Creative Enterprise Zone featuring 
modern and affordable workspace, including artists’ 
studio space, building on the presence of world 
renowned institutions such as Goldsmiths College, 
Trinity Laban Centre and the Albany Theatre. New 
workspace will be delivered through the renewal of 
industrial land, including sites around Surrey Canal 
Road and Deptford Creekside.15.9 Residents and visitors will benefit from excellent 
access to high quality parks, open and green 
spaces. The riverfront will be transformed into 
an attractive leisure destination that is well 
connected to its surrounding neighbourhoods. 
Enhancements to Waterlink Way at Deptford 
Creekside will also provide for improved access 
to the river valley corridor. A network of walking 
routes and cycleways will enhance connections 
within and beyond the area, with Folkestone 
Gardens a focal point for linking key radial 
routes, including the route of the former Grand 
Surrey Canal. New Cross Road (A2) will also be 
transformed using the Healthy Streets Approach 
with public realm enhancements that make 
walking, cycling and the use of public transport 
safer and more convenient, particularly around 
New Cross and New Cross Gate stations.

522Key spatial objectives 
Table
TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION OUR KEY SPATIAL OBJECTIVES (NOT LISTED IN ORDER OF PRIORITY) 
ARE TO:
1 Secure the delivery of the Bakerloo line extension, with a new modern station at New Cross Gate, to improve 
transport access and to help unlock the development potential of the Opportunity Area.
2 Continue to deliver modern business space through the regeneration of larger vacant and underused industrial 
sites, such as Convoys Wharf, Timber Yard at Deptford Wharf and Surrey Canal Triangle. Create new high quality, 
residential and mixed-use areas that are well integrated with existing neighbourhoods and communities, 
including the Pepys Estate.
3 Secure the future of Millwall Football Club in the Borough with a modern stadium as part of a new leisure and 
community destination, supported by a new Overground station.
4 Protect and enable the renewal of industrial land at Surrey Canal Road. Re-configure Strategic Industrial Land 
to create a high quality mixed-used, employment quarter at the edges of Deptford Park and Folkstone Gardens, 
with an improved transition between residential and industrial uses in the area.
5 Create new opportunities for business by making better use of land around railways, including railway arches 
and the ‘Bermondsey Dive Under’.
6 Establish a Creative Enterprise Zone to cement Lewisham’s position as one of London’s leaders in the creative, 
cultural and digital industries. Support and grow these industries through the renewal of industrial sites at 
Deptford Creekside Cultural Quarter, along with new workspace and artists’ studio space elsewhere. Build on the 
presence of world renowned institutions, such as Goldsmiths College, Trinity Laban Centre and Albany Theatre.
7 Deliver heritage-led regeneration schemes to preserve and enhance Lewisham’s industrial and maritime heritage, 
as well as the character and cultural identity of historic High Streets at Deptford and New Cross. Ensure 
Deptford market remains a vibrant hub of commercial and cultural activity at the heart of the community.
8 Apply the Healthy Streets Approach within and around Evelyn Street Local Centre to help secure its long-term 
vitality and viability. Better integrate the centre with surrounding neighbourhoods and Deptford High Street by 
ensuring new development creates a positive relationship with the centre, including new or improved links.
9 Transform New Cross Road (A2) Corridor and other major roads using the Healthy Streets Approach with public 
realm improvements that make walking, cycling and the use of public transport safer and more convenient, 
including the expansion of cycle hire throughout the North Area. Secure the removal of the Amersham Gyratory. 
Create a lively and continuous frontage along New Cross Road by repairing breaks in the townscape, such as 
through infill development and the introduction of active uses at the street level.
10 Maximise the recreational and amenity value of the River Thames and Deptford Creekside by transforming 
the riverside area into a vibrant neighbourhood and visitor destination. Secure Creekside’s continued role in 
accommodating boating communities, including boat dwellings.  Enhance public access to the river, including by 
repairing breaks in the Thames Path and Waterlink Way, as well as enabling river bus services at Convoys Wharf.
11 Protect and enhance open and green spaces, including waterways. Continue to deliver and expand the North 
Lewisham Links, a connected network of high quality walking routes and cycleways  that link these spaces. 
Ensure these routes address existing barriers to movement, such as those caused by the tangle of railways and 
major roads.
12 Safeguard the strategic waste management sites required to ensure Lewisham is net waste self-sufficient. 
Maximise opportunities to improve the environmental performance of existing waste facilities, including by 
developing decentralised energy networks linked to South East London Combined Heat and Power (SELCHP) 
and better mitigating amenity impacts of facilities.

524LNA1 North Area place principles
A Development proposals must contribute to 
the delivery of Good Growth with reference 
to Policy OL1 (Delivering an Open Lewisham) 
and in doing so, demonstrate how they have 
responded positively to and will support the 
achievement of the key spatial objectives for 
the North Area.
B Development proposals must help to ensure 
the North Area benefits from a high quality 
network of walking routes and cycleways that 
connect neighbourhoods and places, including 
green spaces and waterways, having regard 
to Policy GR4 (Lewisham Links). Folkestone 
Gardens should form a central point for a 
series of walking and cycle connections 
across the area, supported by public realm 
enhancements around the viaduct and Surrey 
Canal Road. 
C Development proposals must seek to foster 
community cohesion and improve accessibility 
by addressing elements of the built 
environment that segregate neighbourhoods 
and places from one another. This includes 
severance caused by the convergence of rail 
lines around Surrey Canal Road, the barriers 
to movement around and across other major 
roads, including New Cross Road and Evelyn 
Street (A200) and the wall at Leeway adjacent 
to Convoys Wharf.D Heritage-led regeneration will be vital 
to delivering high quality and distinctive 
neighbourhoods across the North Area. 
Development proposals must respond 
positively to the historic environment as an 
integral part of the design-led approach. 
Opportunities should be taken to preserve, 
better reveal and reinstate heritage assets and 
features that contribute to local character and 
identity, particularly where sites are delivered 
through comprehensive development. This 
includes heritage assets associated with:
a. Deptford’s maritime and industrial heritage, 
including the Royal Naval Dockyard;
b. The route of the Grand Surrey Canal, 
particularly by helping to facilitate the 
delivery of the Surrey Canal Linear Walk 
along with improving public access to it; 
and
c. The historic fabric and urban grain of the 
High Streets at Deptford and New Cross.
E Development proposals must respond 
positively to the River Thames and Deptford 
Creek with reference to Policy LNA4 (Thames 
Policy Area and Deptford Creekside). They 
must maximise opportunities to improve the 
ecological quality and amenity value of these 
waterways, including by creating or enhancing 
walking routes and cycleways to and along the 
waterfront, particularly the Thames Path and 
Waterlink Way at Deptford Creek.

526F Development proposals must respond 
positively to the historic and cultural character 
of New Cross and Deptford District Centres. 
A wide range of commercial, cultural and 
community uses will be supported within the 
centres to support their vitality and long-term 
viability as well as to expand their role as 
key nodes of employment activity within the 
Creative Enterprise Zone.
G Development proposals should reinforce and 
enhance the role of New Cross and Deptford 
Cultural Quarters by supporting and enabling 
the clustering of complementary cultural, 
community and commercial uses within these 
locations, with reference to Policy EC 18 
(Culture, creative industries and the night-time 
economy).
H Deptford market and market yard are at 
the heart of the Deptford District Centre 
and will be protected as an important 
commercial destinations and visitor 
attractions. Development proposals should 
assist in securing the long-term viability of 
the market by protecting and enhancing its 
amenity, delivering public realm and access 
improvements, and making appropriate 
provision of space and facilities for traders.I Development proposals must support the 
vitality and viability of Evelyn Street Local 
Centre by creating and maintaining a positive 
relationship with the centre, and responding 
positively to its location at a key transitional 
position between Deptford High Street and 
Convoys Wharf. This includes the provision 
of new and improved walking routes and 
cycleways to and around the centre, including 
links to open spaces. Proposals should also 
deliver other public realm enhancements 
to improve the place qualities of the centre 
including streets trees and other urban 
greening measures, with reference to Policy 
QD3 (Public realm), 
J Where relevant, development proposals  
must demonstrate how they have responded 
positively to the New Cross Area Framework 
and Surrey Canal Triangle SPD through the 
design-led approach.

15 LEWISHAM’S NORTH AREAA The transformation of the New Cross Road 
/ A2 Corridor and its immediate surrounds 
into a well-connected network of liveable and 
healthy neighbourhoods with a distinctive 
historic and cultural character is integral to the 
delivery of the spatial strategy. Development 
proposals must demonstrate how they will 
make the optimal use of land to support the 
delivery of a high quality, lively and thriving 
High Street whilst reinforcing and enhancing 
the Corridor’s movement function  
B Development proposals along the New Cross 
Road / A2 Corridor and its surrounds must 
enhance the place qualities of the Corridor by:
a. Responding positively to heritage assets, 
including the historic character and urban 
grain of New Cross Road and its wider 
setting;
b. Reinforcing the predominant commercial 
function and distinctive identity of the High 
Street, taking opportunities to introduce a 
wider and richer mix of uses into the area;
c. Enhancing the continuity of the High 
Street from Old Kent Road to Deptford by 
repairing breaks and activating frontages 
along it, particularly through the retention 
and introduction of appropriate commercial, 
cultural and community uses at the street or 
ground floor level;
d. Improving relationships between the 
north and south sides of New Cross 
Road to create a more cohesive High 
Street, including through public realm 
enhancements that reduce barriers to 
movement by walking and cycling and 
enable safe access along and across the 
road;e. Delivering public realm improvements 
that make the Corridor a more accessible, 
attractive and welcoming place;
f. Maximising opportunities to integrate 
tree planting and other urban greening 
measures; 
g. Supporting the continued evolution of the 
Corridor and its surrounds as a more liveable 
and healthy neighbourhood, including 
through the sensitive intensification and 
renewal of sites; and
h. Ensuring development will not result in an 
unacceptable routing or volume of cars and 
other vehicles onto primarily residential 
streets.
C Development proposals must reinforce the role 
of New Cross Road as a strategic movement 
corridor by applying the Healthy Streets 
Approach. This principal east-west route 
should be supported by a complementary 
network of legible, safe and accessible 
walking routes and cycleways that link 
with it to enhance connections between 
neighbourhoods and places. This includes 
connections to Deptford and New Cross 
District Centres, New Cross and New Gate 
stations, Goldsmith’s College and open spaces 
in the surrounding area, such as Bridgehouse 
Meadows, Fordham Park and Folkestone 
Gardens. Development proposals must 
secure the continuity and extension of North 
Lewisham Links Route 1, which runs parallel 
to New Cross Road, including a new bridge 
over the railway at the Hatcham Works and 
Goodwood Road sites.LNA2 New Cross Road / A2 corridor
528D The Council will work in partnership with the 
Mayor of London / Transport for London and 
other stakeholders to deliver new transport 
infrastructure and public realm improvements 
along and around New Cross Road, including:
a. A new high quality station interchange 
at New Cross Gate, which is necessary 
to secure the delivery of the Bakerloo 
line extension and significantly improve 
interchanges between walking, cycling and 
different public transport modes; 
b. Public realm enhancements designed to  
rebalance transport modes along New Cross 
Road with priority given to walking and 
cycling, including by widening pavements 
and reducing pinch-points; and

15 LEWISHAM’S NORTH AREAFigure 15.4: Creative Enterprise Zone
530LNA3 Creative Enterprise Zone
A A Creative Enterprise Zone is designated in 
Lewisham’s North Area. The CEZ reflects the 
presence of significant clusters of creative and 
cultural industries and institutions in the area, the 
positive contribution they make to Lewisham’s 
distinctive character, and the need to expand 
on their role as a catalyst for local economic and 
cultural development.
B To enhance existing clusters of creative and 
cultural industries in the CEZ, and to facilitate the 
creation of additional clusters, new high quality 
workspace and facilities will be secured through:
a. The regeneration of Mixed-use Employment 
Land;
b. Retaining and enhancing workspace provision 
at Deptford Creekside;
c. Focused renewal of SIL and MEL located at the 
convergence of Grinstead Road and Trundleys 
Road to establish a revitalised employment-led 
mixed-use quarter; 
d. Promoting a wide range of complementary 
commercial, cultural and community uses 
within and around New Cross and Deptford 
District Centres, including evening and night-
time economic activities; and
e. Designating Cultural Quarters at Deptford 
Creekside and New Cross and carefully 
managing development within them, in 
accordance with Policy EC18 (Culture, creative 
industries and the night-time economy).
C The continued growth and evolution of the 
creative and cultural industries within the CEZ will 
be supported, in particular, by:
a. Ensuring that development proposals protect 
existing industrial capacity and contribute to 
making provision for flexible workspace and 
facilities in suitable locations, at an appropriate 
range of rents. Development proposals will be considered favourably where they incorporate 
low-cost and an appropriate amount of 
affordable workspace, particularly space catered 
to micro, small and medium sized businesses, 
including start-ups and independents;
b. Ensuring new development proposals are 
designed to enable full-fibre digital connectivity, 
or equivalent infrastructure, to all end users;
c. Encouraging the temporary use of vacant 
buildings and sites for workspace catered to 
creative and cultural activities; and
d. Building on the vital role of the area’s cultural 
and education institutions in supporting the 
local economy, and seeking to strengthen their 
beneficial relationships with Lewisham’s creative 
and cultural industries.
D Within the CEZ development proposals involving 
the loss of Class E(g) office and light industrial 
and Sui Generis business space that is currently 
occupied or suitable for use by the creative and 
cultural industries, including artists workspace, 
will be strongly resisted. Development proposals 
involving the loss or change of use of type of 
workspace will only be permitted where they:
a. Ensure that an equivalent amount of Class E(g) 
workspace is re-provided within the proposal 
(which is appropriate in terms of type, use and 
size), incorporating existing businesses where 
possible; or
b. Within a Mixed-use Employment Location, 
seek to maximise the provision of Class E(g) 
office and light industrial workspace for uses 
in the creative and cultural industries, and 
demonstrate that reasonable efforts have been 
made to retain or re-provide such existing 
provision; and
c. Retain existing and make provision for new 
affordable workspace, in line with Policy EC4 
(Low-cost and affordable workspace).

A Development proposals must respond positively 
to the distinctive character the River Thames 
and Deptford Creek. They must also support 
and seek to maximise the multifunctional social, 
economic and environmental functions and 
benefits of the watercourses, with reference to 
Policy SD9 (Lewisham’s waterways).
B Development proposals on sites within the 
designated Thames Policy Area, and adjacent to 
Deptford Creek, must address the watercourse 
as an integral part of the design-led approach. 
They should help to reinforce and enhance the 
site’s relationship with the River Thames and 
Deptford Creek, including by:  
a. Maintaining and enhancing the ecological 
quality and nature conservation value of the 
river or creek and its corridor, including the 
walls and foreshore;
b. Maximising opportunities to enhance the 
aesthetic value of the watercourse and visual 
amenity provided by it, having particular 
regard to:
i. Views, vistas, landmark features and other 
points of interest;
ii. Building lines, along with the orientation 
and spacing between buildings; and
iii. Physical connections to the river or creek, 
including walking and cycle routes that 
enable access to the waterfront;
c. Addressing the river or creek as an important 
part of the public realm and contributing to 
the liveliness of the waterfront. Development 
should incorporate positive frontages and, 
where appropriate, accessible public spaces 
or facilities at the ground floors of buildings 
and their forecourts, particularly along the 
Thames Path and Waterlink Way;d. Maintaining the stability of the flood 
defences and investigating opportunities 
to retreat flood defences, particularly to 
increase flood storage, enhance biodiversity, 
and create or improve visual connections 
with the river or creek;
e. Resisting encroachment into the creek or 
river and foreshore; 
f. Making provision for an appropriate mix of 
uses on sites, along with enabling river-
related and marine uses, where appropriate, 
in line with other policies. Consideration 
must be given to the requirements of the 
existing boating community and Creekside’s 
continued role in accommodating boat 
dwellings to help meet housing needs; and
g. Ensuring development does not adversely 
impact on the amenity of uses within 
industrial areas and safeguarded wharves, in 
line with the Agent of Change.
C Development proposals on sites within the 
Thames Policy Area, and adjacent to Deptford 
Creek, must preserve or wherever possible 
enhance the significance of heritage assets 
and their setting. This will require that 
particular attention is given to the maritime 
and industrial heritage of the area, and that 
opportunities to preserve or reinstate heritage 
assets are fully investigated and implemented 
wherever feasible.

15 LEWISHAM’S NORTH AREALewisham’s North Area
15.10 Lewisham’s North Area has a key role to play 
in accommodating growth and where the 
Council will continue to support regeneration 
to secure inclusive, safe, healthy and liveable 
neighbourhoods. A large part of the area falls 
within a London Plan Opportunity Area and is 
therefore instrumental to the delivery of the 
spatial development strategy for London. There are 
pockets of deprivation across the North Area, with 
some localities in the 20 per cent most deprived 
in the country. Targeted interventions are required 
to tackle inequalities and the social, economic 
and environmental barriers that contribute to 
deprivation. The Local Plan sets out a strategy 
to ensure that growth and regeneration in the 
North Area is effectively coordinated, with a clear 
framework in place to facilitate the Bakerloo line 
extension. It requires that new development is 
well integrated with existing neighbourhoods 
and communities and maximises opportunities to 
deliver transformational area improvements for the 
benefit of everyone.
15.11 Mixed-use Employment Locations present the 
main opportunities for accommodating growth 
and securing new investment in the North Area. 
MELs are, for the most part, underused and 
vacant industrial sites. They are the Borough’s 
largest reservoir of brownfield land suitable for 
redevelopment and include the Convoys Wharf 
and Surrey Canal Triangle sites. There are now a 
number of MELs with planning consent for mixed-
use development and some sites have started to 
come forward. We will continue to support the 
comprehensive regeneration and renewal of MELs 
in order to improve the environmental quality of 
the North Area and to deliver significant amounts 
of new housing, including genuinely affordable 
housing, workspace, community facilities and public realm enhancements, including new public 
open and green space. There is also scope to 
consolidate SIL land around Trundleys Road to 
create a high quality mixed-use employment 
quarter with an improved relationship with 
Folkestone Gardens. This will be facilitated through 
the plan-led process, in line with Policy EC5 
(Strategic Industrial Locations), to ensure there is 
no net loss of industrial capacity. Site allocations 
set parameters for and will ensure certainty over 
the delivery of MELs and SIL. Guidance has also 
been prepared to support the Local Plan policies 
and provide clarity for the public on development 
opportunities and outcomes sought, including the 
Surrey Canal Triangle SPD and New Cross Area 
Framework.
15.12 The Local Plan designates a new Creative Enterprise 
Zone in North Lewisham. This is one of the first 
CEZs in the Capital and is backed by the Mayor 
of London. It reflects the strength of our cultural, 
creative and digital industries and their rapid 
growth in the Borough in recent years. The Local 
Plan aims to enable the conditions for these 
sectors to continue to prosper over the long-term. 
This includes a positive and proactive approach 
to managing industrial land in the North Area to 
intensify development on employment sites and 
secure the delivery of new high quality workspace, 
including low-cost and affordable workspace as well 
as artists’ studio space, for which there is a demand. 
This approach is complemented by other measures 
targeted at boosting these employment sectors. 
They include the designation of Cultural Quarters at 
Deptford Creekside and New Cross as well as Night-
time Economy Hubs. These other measures aim to 
build on the diversity and strengths of the area’s 
historic High Streets and their surrounds, as well its 
cultural assets and education institutions.
53415.13 Lewisham is in many ways defined by its 
connection to the River Thames and its 
tributaries. The Thames Policy Area is designated 
in the Local Plan. It requires that careful 
consideration is given to the character, amenity 
value and environmental quality of the River 
Thames and Deptford Creekside, along with the 
strategic function of the waterway network, 
including for passenger travel, river and marine-
based commercial uses. Development proposals 
must comply with the Agent of Change principle. 
This will ensure that designs avoid, minimise 
and appropriately mitigate disturbances (such 
as noise) and conflicts that may result from the 
wide range of land uses within the area, including 
on industrial sites and safeguarded wharves. 
The river network also has and will continue to 
play an important role in shaping Lewisham’s 
identity and character. Creekside is home to 
an established boating community including 
boat dwellings. The Port of London Authority’s 
Thames Vision also highlights the southern part 
of Deptford Creek as a potential Residential 
Mooring Opportunity Zone. The Borough has 
a distinctive maritime and industrial heritage, 
including the Royal Naval Dockyard and the 
Grand Surrey Canal, and there are opportunities 
to enhance, better reveal and reinstate heritage 
assets through heritage-led regeneration.15.14 An effective and resilient transport network 
is essential to inclusive, safe, healthy and 
liveable neighbourhoods. There are a number 
of strategic transport schemes within the 
North Area which will help to support the 
levels of planned growth both in Lewisham 
and across London. This includes the Bakerloo 
line extension, including a new station at New 
Cross Gate, along with a new station at Surrey 
Canal Road serving the London Overground. 
Along with securing these public transport 
schemes the Local Plan seeks to deliver a well-
integrated network of high quality walking 
routes and cycleways. The main aim is to realise 
a significant modal shift from journeys made by 
vehicles to more sustainable modes. This will 
be enabled through the transformation of New 
Cross Road / A2 Corridor and other major roads 
using the Healthy Street Approach. New Cross 
Road is a prominent east-west route within the 
area linking important visitor destinations. It has 
significant potential for improving connections 
between neighbourhoods and places, along with 
site redevelopment opportunities which can 
help to enable public realm enhancements and 
townscape improvements.
15.15 The North Lewisham Links is a well-connected 
network of high quality walking routes and 
cycleways that has been successfully delivered 
in key locations in the area, helping to improve 
access to parks, green spaces, waterways and 
other key destinations. Development proposals 
must continue to support the delivery of these 
vital routes. The success of this project has 
set a model for public realm enhancements 
throughout the Borough, which will be 
implemented in line with Policy GR4 (Lewisham 
Links).

Opportunities
15.24 Convoys Wharf is a large brownfield site covering 
an area of more than 16 hectares, which is 
strategically located along the River Thames. In 
the 16th Century it was the site of the Royal Naval 
Dockyard. The site has been vacant for many years 
having last been used for industrial activities. 
Comprehensive redevelopment of the site is 
integral to supporting regeneration in the Deptford 
area, with the creation of a new high quality mixed-
use quarter that responds positively to its historical 
context. With the site’s prominent riverside 
location, and proximity to Deptford High Street, 
there is significant scope for transformational public 
539
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
15 LEWISHAM’S NORTH AREArealm and environmental enhancements. These 
will support the delivery of a new residential area 
and visitor destination that is well-integrated 
with its surrounding neighbourhoods and 
communities. There are further opportunities to 
re-activate the safeguarded wharf that comprises 
part of the site, including for river based 
passenger transport.
15.25 Development requirements
1. Development must be delivered in accordance 
with a masterplan to ensure coordination of uses 
across the site.
2. Provision of commercial floorspace in line with 
Policy EC7 (Mixed-use Employment Locations).
3. The site must be fully re-integrated with 
the surrounding street network to improve 
access and permeability in the local area, 
with enhanced walking and cycle connections 
between public spaces and the site’s surrounding 
neighbourhoods. Development must also enable 
new public transport services within and through 
the site. This will require a hierarchy of routes 
with clearly articulated east-west and north-
south corridors, including publicly accessible 
routes to and along the River Thames. 
4. Provision of new community infrastructure to 
meet demand arising from the development, 
including a new school and health facilities.
5. Long-term protection and appropriate re-
activation of the existing safeguarded wharf and 
associated vessel moorings, including for river 
based passenger transport. 
6. Delivery of new and improved public realm and 
open space in accordance with a site-wide public 
realm strategy, and taking into account the River 
Corridor Improvement Plan SPD, including:
a. Repair of breaks in the Thames Path and 
extension of the route along the riverfront 
across the site, or as near as practical having 
regard to the safeguarded wharf
b. New public open space at key points along the 
riverfront, including the Royal Navy and Royal 
Caroline Squares
c. Integration of central public square / open space as a community focal point, with priority 
given to siting of the space between the 
Olympia Warehouse and the riverside
d. Enhancements to Sayes Court Park and its 
setting
e. A high quality station approach to the jetty 
(for river bus services), including walking and 
cycle routes 
7. Re-instatement of the Thames-side pier with the 
creation a new riverfront park and public cultural 
space, incorporating the Thames Path, with 
opportunities for waterside activities.
8. Positive frontages along key routes, with active 
ground floor frontages along the riverfront and 
elsewhere where possible
9. Development proposals must protect and seek to 
enhance green infrastructure, including the SINC.
10. The design of the development must be 
demonstrably informed by and reflect the site’s 
historical character and significance.
15.26 Development guidelines
1. Development should support the creation of a 
new high quality, mixed-use neighbour-hood and 
visitor destination that is well integrated with its 
surrounding neighbourhoods and communities.
2. Development should provide for a main access 
route north/south of Deptford High Street/
New King Street to the Thames frontage, with 
measures to improve legibility and access to 
Deptford High Street.
3. The development should be designed to 
maximise views to and from the River Thames. 
Where tall and taller buildings are proposed, 
consideration will need to be given to protected 
views, vistas and landmark features, including 
the Grade II* Listed St Nicholas Church, the 
panorama towards the Maritime Greenwich World 
Heritage Site, and protected vistas of St Paul’s 
Cathedral.
4. In response to the scale and location of 
the site, development should provide for 
complementary and distinctive character areas 
across it. These should reflect and reinforce the 
hierarchy of streets and open/green spaces, 
540with a differentiation in design, density, scale 
and massing, including a range of plot sizes and 
building heights. 
5. Development should make provision of open space 
to enlarge Sayes Court Park and celebrate the 
sites historic connection with John Evelyn. New 
gardens, landscaping and treatment of the public 
realm should connect with the memory of John 
Evelyn’s fa-mous 17th century garden that once 
flourished on the site. 
6. Development should be designed to improve 
connectivity with, and maximise the value of, 
existing neighbouring green spaces including 
Pepys Park to the west, Twinkle Park to the east 
and Sayes Court Park to the south.
7. The type of uses on the safeguarded wharf should 
be restricted to those specified in the S106, to 
ensure compatibility with residential use nearby, in 
line with the Agent of Change principle.
8. Development must support conservation objectives 
by preserving and enhancing heritage assets and 
their setting, using history and heritage to inform 
the masterplan, incorporating heritage assets 
into the layout of the site in a positive way, and 
celebrating their significance through increased 
public access and opportunities for interpretation. 
This includes:
a. The Grade II Listed Olympia Building which 
shall be retained, restored and regenerated to 
become an iconic landmark on the River Thames 
and a central feature of the development and a 
new cultural destination, with improved physical 
and/or visual links between Olympia Wharf, the 
riverfront and Sayes Court Park. 
b. Tudor naval storehouse, a Scheduled Ancient 
Monument of the highest significance, which 
shall be retained.
c. The historic boundary wall (including Grade II 
listed river wall, Grade II listed entrance gates 
at the south western corner and Grade II listed 
wall on the eastern side) is characteristic of 
a Naval Shipyard and shall be retained and 
restored, preserving a semblance of the past 
with improved connectivity.  New entrances to 
the site should be carefully sited and where the wall is lost, treatment should mark its former 
location.
d. Other features such as the central basement, 
slipway 1, mast pond, double dry dock, 
slipways 4 & 5, John Evelyn House and Sayes 
Court Manor and Grade II* Listed Master 
Shipwrights on the adjacent site should be 
considered in the design of the site.
e. Provision of open spaces at key points on 
the water’s edge including Royal Navy and 
Royal Caroline Squares to celebrate the sites 
archaeological remains and heritage features.
f. The Grade II* Listed St Nicholas Church 
located to the south east of the site.
9. Development proposals should explore 
options for removing the boundary wall to 
better integrate the site with its surrounding 
neighbourhoods. Careful consideration will need 
to be given to those elements of the wall that are 
heritage assets.
10. Transport for London, the Port of London 
Authority and the Marine Management Or-
ganisation should be consulted on development 
and design options.
11. Proposals should investigate and maximise 
opportunities for Decentralised Energy, including 
connections to SELCHP .
12. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against flood 
risk, improve biodiversity, maximise opportunities 
to improve riverside access and deliver a riverside 
buffer zone and deliver TE2100 plan actions.
13. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water to manage surface water, divert 
existing sewers where applicable and ensure 
infrastructure upgrades are delivered ahead of 
the site being occupied.

543
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
15 LEWISHAM’S NORTH AREA15.33 Development requirements
1. Development must be delivered in accordance 
with a masterplan (as secured through the 
hybrid planning consent) to ensure coordination, 
phasing and balance of uses across the site, 
and in line with Policy DM3 (Masterplans and 
comprehensive development).
2. Provision of commercial floorspace in line with 
Policy EC7 (Mixed-use Employment Locations).  
3. The site must be fully re-integrated with 
the surrounding street network to improve 
access and permeability in the local area, 
with enhanced walking and cycle connections 
between public spaces and the site’s surrounding 
neighbourhoods. This will require a hierarchy 
of routes with clearly articulated east-west 
and north-south corridors. Delivery of new 
and improved public realm and open space in 
accordance with a site-wide public realm strategy, 
including:  
a. Re-instatement of the route of the former 
Surrey Canal to form a high quality public 
open space linked to the wider walking and 
cycle network.
b. Positive frontages along Evelyn Street, 
Oxestalls Road, Grove Street and Dragoon 
Road and other key routes, with active ground 
floor frontages where possible.
15.34 Development guidelines
1. Building heights should respond positively to the 
existing Victorian properties on the opposite side 
of Evelyn Street and the Victoria Pub and Scott 
House on Grove Street. Taller elements may be 
appropriate along Surrey Canal Way and opposite 
Pepys Park, to mark the significant of these open 
spaces and to enable more residents to benefit 
from outlook across them. 2. Tall buildings will be most appropriate on the 
corners of Evelyn Street/Oxestalls Road and 
Grove Street/Dragoon Road, forming corners 
for the urban block, aiding with legibility and 
wayfinding.
3. Development should respond positively to 
the social and built heritage of the site, whilst 
ensuring uses are well integrated with the 
surrounding communities and neighbourhoods.  
A range of materials should be used across the 
site to reflect the historic character, including 
the timber wharf, warehouses and Victorian Villas 
that existed on the site as well as to link with 
other buildings such as the Laban Centre.
4. Development should be designed to enable 
vehicular access from Grove Street and restrict 
access from Evelyn Street. 
5. Development must address the future use of 
Blackhorse Bridge over the former Surrey Canal.
6. Development should enhance connections and 
legibility through the site, with routes running 
between Evelyn Street and Grove Street, and 
by creating a permeable streetscape with 
improved walking and cycle links to Evelyn Street 
(including the Cycle Super Highway), Pepys 
Estate, Pepys Park and Deptford Park to the 
Thames Riverfront.
7. Proposals should investigate and maximise 
opportunities for Decentralised Energy, including 
connections to SELCHP .
8. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against

Site allocation
15.36 Comprehensive employment-led redevelopment 
on this re-designated Locally Significant 
Industrial Site. Co-location of compatible 
commercial and residential uses. Public realm 
enhancements, including improved connections 
to Deptford Park.
Opportunities
15.37 The site forms the north-eastern end of the 
Surrey Canal Road Strategic Industrial Location, 
with Deptford Trading Estate located immediately 
to the south-east. An office block, Evelyn 
Court, takes up a significant part of the site, 
and there is an unimplemented Prior Approval 
for its conversion to housing. The site also 
includes Parker House in different ownership. 
By re-designating the site from SIL to LSIS, 
redevelopment and site intensification, along 
with the co-location of commercial and other 
uses, will provide a more optimal use of land 
and ensure the site maintains its employment 
function. Replacement provision of industrial 
land will be made at the Bermondsey Dive Under 
site. Development will also enable public realm 
enhancements, including improved access to 
Deptford Park from the Deptford Landings site, 
on the opposite side of Evelyn Street.15.38 Development requirements
1. Landowners must work in partnership and 
development must take account of the existing 
prior approvals and be delivered in accordance 
with a masterplan, to ensure coordination and 
phasing in the co-location of uses across the 
site, including on the plots currently occupied by 
Evelyn Court and Parker House, and in line with 
Policy DM3 (Masterplans and comprehensive 
development).
2. Development must not result in the net loss of 
industrial capacity, or compromise the function 
of the LSIS, in line with Policy EC6 (Locally 
Significant Industrial Sites).
3. Positive frontages along Evelyn Street and 
Grinstead Road.
4. New and improved public realm in accordance 
with a site-wide public realm strategy, including 
improved connections between The Deptford 
Landings  development at Oxestalls Road, 
Deptford Park and along the route of the former 
Surrey Canal and to facilitate the delivery of 
Cycleway 4. 
15.39 Development guidelines
1. Whilst replacement provision of SIL land 
will be made at the Bermondsey Dive Under 
site, development should be demonstrably 
employment-led to ensure the long-term viability 
of commercial uses at the site and wider SIL area. 
Further details on calculating industrial capacity 
are set out in with Policy EC6 (Locally Significant 
Industrial Sites).
5462. Development should be designed to respond 
positively with the development at The Deptford 
Landings, Oxestalls Road MEL.  
3. Non-employment uses, including residential 
uses, must be sensitively integrated into the 
development in order to ensure the protection 
of amenity for all site users, along with safe 
and convenient access. This will require careful 
consideration of the operational requirements of 
existing and potential future employment uses, 
including uses at the adjacent Deptford Trading 
Estate and in line with the Agent of Change 
principle.
4. The bulk, massing, scale and height of the 
buildings should respond positively to the 
existing residential properties along Grinstead 
Road and the three to four storey terraced 
properties along Evelyn Street, along with the tall 
buildings on the opposite side of Evelyn Street 
(Deptford Landings, Oxestalls Road MEL). 
5. Landscaping should be designed as an integral 
part of the overall development, with an 
enhanced relationship with Deptford Park and 
enhancements to the amenity of the site, focused 
around an enhanced walking/cycle route running 
along the site boundary. Development should 
not result in a reduction in existing footway or 
carriageway space.
6. Development should be designed to retain 
existing vehicular access onto Grinstead Road.
7. The demolition of the existing office block will be 
supported to enable the delivery of high quality, 
purpose built housing as a component of an 
employment-led mixed-use scheme.8. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
9. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
manage surface water and divert existing sewers 
where applicable. New connections into the 
Evelyn Street trunk sewer will not be allowed.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
15 LEWISHAM’S NORTH AREA15.44 Development guidelines
1. The rhythm of the frontage to Grinstead Road 
should relate well to Deptford Park, with 
development maximising the amenity provided 
by the park and active ground floor uses to 
improve the public realm and townscape along 
Grinstead Road.
2. Development should be designed to enhance 
safety, including by sensitively integrated 
external lighting and layout to allow for natural 
surveillance of new public realm, particularly 
around the railway arches, along Grinstead Road, 
along the Old Tow Path and within communal 
courtyards. 
3. The design of development should respond 
positively to Deptford Park, the neighbour-ing 
residential buildings, Sir Francis Drake Primary 
School and Old Tow Path. The tall-est building 
point should form a key landmark that is clearly 
visible from south of the vi-aduct and is located 
at the western edge of the site, along the railway.  
Two storeys of commercial floorspace should 
be integrated, in order to lift the residential 
elements above the railway. Building heights 
should drop down along Grinstead Road adjacent 
to the park, ensuring adequate daylight is 
provided to the existing neighbouring buildings.
4. The design of the development should allow 
views from Folkestone Gardens and Deptford 
Park, and across to Canary Wharf.5. Proposals should investigate and maximise 
opportunities for Decentralised Energy, including 
connections to SELCHP .
6. Applicants should consult and work in 
partnership with Network Rail, and landowners 
as appropriate, to optimise the use of the 
railway arches and create active frontages whilst 
retaining an appropriate clear zone.
7. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
8. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water to manage surface water, divert 
existing sewers where applicable and ensure 
infrastructure upgrades are delivered ahead of 
the site being occupied.

Industrial and commercial uses on land 
designated as Strategic Industrial Location and 
Locally Significant Industrial Site.
Opportunities
The site is situated to the north of the Surrey 
Canal Road Strategic Industrial Location and 
south of Silwood Street.  The presence of 
elevated railway tracks that run through and 
surround the site, together with SELCHP 
immediately to the east of the site, make 
it a wholly unsuitable site for residential 
development.   The site is currently owned by 
Network Rail but is no longer in operational 
use. Redevelopment of the land will provide 
the opportunity to enhance local amenity 
and provide new industrial land designated as 
Strategic Industrial Land and Locally Significant 
Industrial Land.  This in turn will allow the de-
designated of some sites within the existing 
Surrey Canal SIL for mixed use development. 
There are also arches beneath the railway that 
are currently vacant and in need of significant 
repair. The confined nature of the arches make 
them less suited to industrial uses traditionally 
found in SIL. However, there are opportunities 
for this part of the site to be developed as a 
Locally Significant Industrial Location, to deliver 
high quality, small scale workspace for a range of 
industrial and commercial uses. 15.58 Development requirements
1. Development must provide substitute industrial 
capacity, to enable the re-configuration of the 
Surrey Canal Road SIL and the release of SIL 
at Apollo Business Centre, Trundleys Road and 
Evelyn Court.
2. Development proposals within the SIL part of the 
site will be supported where the uses fall within 
the industrial-type activities specified by the 
London Plan.  
3. Development must not adversely impact on 
the function or effectiveness of the SIL to 
accommodate commercial and industrial uses 
or their ability to function on a 24-hour basis, 
in line with Policy EC5 (Strategic Industrial 
Locations).  
4. Industrial uses will be limited to those suited to 
the site, taking account of the nature of the site.  
Uses requiring large services vehicles will not be 
permitted due to the restricted access of the site.
5. Development proposals within the LSIS part of 
the site will be supported where the uses include 
Class E(g) light industrial, Class B industrial, 
small scale Class B8 storage and distribution 
and related Sui Generis uses; where they can be 
accommodated within the confines of the railway 
arches and can contribute to their viability. 
6. Development must not adversely impact on 
the function or effectiveness of the LSIS to 
accommodate commercial and industrial uses, in 
line with Policy EC6 (Locally Significant Industrial 
Sites).
56015.59 Development guidelines
1. Development should ensure the long-term 
viability of industrial and commercial uses at the 
site.
2. Development will be expected to make 
provision for high quality and flexibly designed 
employment floorspace and units that are 
well-suited to the operational requirements of 
commercial and industrial occupiers. Particular 
consideration will need to be given to the 
development’s functional and visual interface 
with the residential properties located along 
Silwood Street.
3. Development should seek to enhance the 
amenity for all site users, and provide safe and 
convenient site access. This will require careful 
consideration of the operational requirements 
of potential future employment uses and ensure 
coordination of industrial and commercial uses 
across the SIL and LSIS.
4. Applicants should consult and work in 
partnership with Network Rail, and landowners 
as appropriate, to optimise the use of the 
railway arches and create active frontages whilst 
retaining an appropriate clear zone.

retention,  enhancement and expansion of the 
football stadium. New and improved transport 
infrastructure, including a new rail station serving 
the East London line (London Overground). 
Reconfiguration of buildings and spaces to 
facilitate new and improved routes, both into 
and through the site, along with public realm 
and environmental enhancements, including new 
public open space.
Opportunities
15.63 Surrey Canal Triangle is a large brownfield site 
covering an area of more than 10 hectares. 
Part of the site is owned by Renewal and part 
is owned by the Council. The site is bounded 
by railway lines and bisected by Surrey Canal 
Road, with the Millwall Football Club stadium 
occupying a prominent position within it. There 
are 26 existing residential units located on the 
site. Comprehensive redevelopment of the site 
is integral to supporting regeneration in the 
area, with the creation of a new high quality 
mixed-use quarter and leisure destination that 
will help to secure a viable future for Millwall FC 
on this site. There is scope for transformational 
public realm and environmental enhancements to 
address existing issues of severance, and which 
are necessary to re-connect and better integrate 
the site with its surrounding neighbourhoods and 
communities, as well as the area’s wider network 
of open spaces.
563
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
15 LEWISHAM’S NORTH AREA15.64 Development requirements
1. Landowners must work in partnership and 
development must have regard to the 
overarching vision and development principles 
set out in the Surrey Canal Triangle SPD and 
the permitted development scheme already 
consented on Renewal’s land.  The masterplan 
must consider co-location, phasing and balance 
of uses across the site, in line with Policy DM3 
(Masterplans and comprehensive development).
2. Development of the Council owned land must 
capitalise on the opportunities presented by 
Millwall FC Stadium, including options for its 
re-provision and expansion, helping to secure the 
long term future of the football club  on this site. 
3. Development proposals must seek to enhance 
the existing sports facilities, and make these 
accessible to the public and allow for the long 
term future of the Millwall Community Scheme.
4. Development proposals must demonstrate a 
comprehensive and coordinated approach to 
supporting  healthy communities by integrating 
new and enhanced  publicly accessible sports, 
leisure and recreation opportunities, including 
open spaces and community facilities, in line with 
Policy CI1 (Safeguarding and securing community 
infrastructure).
5. Provision of commercial floorspace in line with 
Policy EC7 (Mixed-use Employment Locations). 
6. The site must be fully re-integrated with 
the surrounding street network to improve 
access and permeability in the local area, 
with enhanced walking and cycle connections 
between public spaces and the site’s surrounding 
neighbourhoods. This will require a hierarchy 
of routes with clearly articulated east-west 
and north-south corridors.  The site must also 
facilitate the delivery of Cycleway 10. 7. Delivery of new and improved public realm and 
open space in accordance with a site-wide public 
realm strategy, including:
a. A linked network of new high quality public 
open and green spaces as a central design 
feature
b. Enhancements to Bridgehouse Meadows 
and Bolina Gardens, including access 
improvements, in partnership with 
infrastructure providers.
c. High quality approaches to the existing 
South Bermondsey station and the future 
Overground station.
8. Provision for the new transport infrastructure 
within the site, including a new Overground 
station at Surrey Canal Road and an 
accompanying walking and cycle bridge, in 
partnership with TFL and infrastructure providers. 
9. Positive frontages along key routes, with active 
ground floor frontages where possible.
10. Development proposals must protect and seek to 
enhance green infrastructure, including the SINC.
15.65 Development guidelines
1. Development should support the creation of a 
new high quality, mixed-use neighbour-hood and 
visitor destination that is well integrated with its 
surrounding neighbourhoods and communities. 
Main town centre uses should be complementary 
in nature and scale and focussed on serving the 
development, whilst ensuring no adverse impact 
on exist-ing town centres. 
2. A new east-west route linking Folkestone 
Gardens / Deptford Park and Old Kent Road 
should form a central design feature, along 
with a clear north-south route linking South 
Bermondsey station to Bridgehouse Meadows 
and the new Overground station.
5643. Quietway 1 runs along the eastern edge of 
the site, and should form a key focus for 
enhancements to the cycle network.
4. The layout of the site should ensure that Millwall 
FC Stadium can continue to function as a large 
spectator destination on a long term basis and 
must ensure it does not preju-dice the ability of 
the stadium to expand. This includes appropriate 
arrangements for ongoing operation of the 
stadium, access, servicing and evacuation, 
without the need for relocation during 
construction of the Council owned land. 
5.  The design of development (including bulk, 
scale, massing and height of the buildings) 
should respond positively to its surrounding 
context and skyline including the heights of 
the railway viaducts, the SELCHP to the east of 
the site as well as Millwall FC Stadium located 
within the site. The site is a suitable location for 
tall buildings and the potential for tall buildings 
should be explored through the design-led 
process, taking into account protected views and 
vistas, including the panorama of the Bridge over 
the Serpentine.
6. New routes, public realm and open spaces 
should be designed to address severance within 
and outside of the site caused by railways, 
embankments, roads and SELCHP . Public realm 
and access enhancements should include :
a. Walking and cycle routes along Bolina Road, 
and improved connectivity to Cycleway 10,
b. Walking and cycle routes to Surrey Quays 
north alongside the Overground,
c. Walking and cycle routes and access to the 
new railway station at Surrey Canal Road and 
South Bermondsey stationd. Improved links to Bridgehouse Meadows 
including upgrades to the Connect 2 path 
running between Bridgehouse Meadows and 
Oldfield Grove
e. Improvements to enable bus services within 
the site.
7. The design of development should respond 
positively to the historical and industrial character 
of the area, including the unlisted historic 
buildings at Ilderton Road.  Connectivity with the 
old gas holders on Old Kent Road in the borough 
of Southwark should also be considered.
8. Proposals should maximise opportunities to 
for decentralised energy network development 
associated with South East London Combined 
Heat and Power Station (SELCHP).
9. Transport for London and Network Rail should be 
consulted on development and design options.
10. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
11. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water to manage surface water, divert 
existing sewers where applicable and ensure 
infrastructure upgrades are delivered ahead 
of the site being occupied. New connections 
into the Ilderton Road trunk sewer will not be 
allowed. As Bolina Road does not have capacity 
for the whole of the site, development should 
utilise the capacity at the south end of the site.

Opportunities
15.69 This vacant site is located in Kender Triangle, 
and is bounded mainly by Briant Street and 
Besson Street, with a small frontage onto New 
Cross Road to the north east. It is situated in 
proximity to New Cross Road local centre and 
New Cross Gate station. .  Site redevelopment 
will bring a vacant site back into active use and 
provide a more optimal use of land, with the 
introduction of a complementary range of uses, 
including new housing and community facili-
ties. Redevelopment will also enable townscape 
improvements and public realm enhance-ments, 
including new public amenity space to act as a 
focal point for the neighbourhood  15.70 Development requirements
1. Well integrated community facilities that create a 
new focal point for the neighbourhood.
2. The site must be fully re-integrated with the 
surrounding street network to improve access 
and permeability, with enhanced walking and 
cycle connections to residential areas and public 
spaces. This will require a hierarchy of routes 
with clearly articulated corridors between Briant 
Street, Besson Street and New Cross Road.
3. Positive frontages along Briant Street, Besson 
Street and New Cross Road, with active ground 
floor frontages.
4. Delivery of new and improved public realm and

more coherent and unified street edge. A taller 
building on this junction may be appropriate to 
assist with wayfinding.
2. The design of development should respond 
positively to the surrounding area, in particular: 
a. Hatcham Conservation Area and Telegraph Hill 
Conservation Area. 
b. The Locally Listed Music Room, All Saints 
Church and the low rise villas on New Cross 
Road, at 116-118 New Cross Road. 
c. The small scale backland buildings visible at 
the end of Fisher’s Court. 
567
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
15 LEWISHAM’S NORTH AREA3. Taller buildings will be most appropriately sited 
along Briant Street.
4. A unique but sensitive frontage on New Cross 
Road should respond to its position without 
creating an overly dominant façade. 
5. 5. Buildings should be focussed on the perimeter 
of the site to avoid overshadowing and wind 
tunnel effect.
6. There should be multiple active entrances and 
clear sight lines across the new public square, 
along with architectural differentiation of 
community facilities and private residential uses.
7. The layout of the site should create attractive 
and legible connections throughout the 
site, (including north-south from New Cross 
Road to Besson Street) enhancing links with 
neighbourhoods north and south of the site, 
and to Besson Street Gardens open space to the 
south west.
8. Applicants should work in partnership with

New and improved transport infrastructure, 
including land and facilities required to 
accommodate the Bakerloo line extension. 
Comprehensive mixed-use redevelopment with 
compatible main town centre and residential 
uses. 
Opportunities
The former site of the Hatcham Works is 
currently occupied by a retail park, including a 
Sainsbury’s supermarket. The site is strategically 
located within the New Cross Gate District 
Centre, immediately to the west of New Cross 
Gate station and fronting New Cross Road. In 
March 2021 the Secretary of State issued a 
Safeguarding Direction for the BLE and this 
site has been identified as a temporary works 
site during the construction phase of the BLE. 
Redevelopment will enable the delivery of new 
and improved transport infrastructure, including 
a new station to accommodate the Bakerloo 
line extension. Development can make a more 
optimal use of land, with site intensification 
and the introduction of a wider range of uses to 
support the vitality and viability of the District 
Centre.  
15.72 Development requirements
1. Development must be delivered in accordance 
with a masterplan that addresses the site’s 
relationship with New Cross Gate station and 
the Goodwood Road / New Cross Road site and 
any requirements associated with the transport 
network, taking into account the New Cross Area 
Framework SPD. The masterplan should consider 
co-location, phasing and balance of uses across 
the site, in line with Policy DM3 (Masterplan and 
comprehensive development)2. The site is safeguarded for the delivery of the 
BLE and as a temporary works site. This includes 
creation of a new Bakerloo Line station which 
should integrate with the existing station, in 
consultation with Transport for London and 
Network Rail. No prejudicial development should 
occur before the BLE is delivered.
3. The site must be fully re-integrated with 
the surrounding street network to improve 
access and permeability in the local area, 
with enhanced walking and cycle connections 
between public spaces and the site’s surrounding 
neighbourhoods. This will require a hierarchy 
of routes with clearly articulated east-west 
and north-south corridors. The site must also 
facilitate the delivery of Cycleway 11 along New 
Cross Road.
4. Delivery of new and improved public realm in 
accordance with a site-wide public realm strategy, 
including:
a. New walking and cycle access through the site 
from Hatcham Park Road / Hart’s Lane. This 
must include a clearly articulated east-west 
route within the site, also enabling a link from 
Hatcham Park Road to Batavia Road via a 
bridge over the railway.
b. Public realm improvements to enhance the 
station approach and improve the walking 
environment, including along New Cross 
Road and Hearts Lane, with a well-integrated 
station square.
c. Cycle parking infrastructure including a cycle 
hub.
5. Positive frontages along New Cross Road, Harts 
Lane and other key routes, with active ground 
floor frontages.
15.73 Development guidelines
5701. The design of development (including bulk, 
scale, massing and height of buildings) must 
respond positively to local character and should 
seek to enhance the setting of the heritage 
assets in the area including within the adjoining 
Hatcham Conservation Area, adjoining Telegraph 
Hill Conservation Area and nearby Deptford Town 
Conservation Area. In particular: 
a. all buildings, as defined within the context 
of New Cross Gate, should be set back from 
New Cross Road and should be located more 
centrally in the site to minimise visual conflict 
with the heritage designed street frontages 
to the south and south east, and with the 
modestly scaled residential character of the 
areas to the east and west. In particular, there 
should be no tall buildings visible over the 
roofscape of New Cross Road as viewed from 
the junction with Lewisham Way.  There should 
be no tall buildings close to New Cross Road 
so as to allow a contextual re-creation of the 
street frontage that protects and maintain the 
character of the street.  Means of mitigating 
or minimising the impact of tall buildings 
on the setting of Hatcham and Telegraph 
Hill Conservation Area and on views from 
within them should include consideration of 
silhouette, location and footprint, materiality 
and elevational design.
b. There should be a positive relationship with 
the site’s western edge that enhances the 
junction of Hatcham Park Road and access to 
the site, activates the east side of Harts Lane 
and preserves the character of Brighton Grove.
c. Given the low rise nature of the surroundings and the presence of designated conservation 
areas to the west, south and south east, 
proposals must be rigorously tested to 
demonstrate the impacts on the heritage 
assets in the vicinity, their setting and the 
neighbouring non-heritage designated 
townscape. 
2. The layout of the site should incorporate 
sufficient space to accommodate interchange 
between bus, tube, rail, cycling and walking.
3. Development should provide for a range of unit 
sizes to accommodate a rich mix of main town 
centre uses, with flexibly specified units that can 
be adapted for a variety of end users.
4. Transport for London and Network Rail should 
be consulted on development and design 
options. Development proposals should maximise 
opportunities to enhance biodiversity within the 
green corridor that stretches along the railway 
line to the east of the site.
5. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
manage surface water, divert existing sewers 
where applicable, allow access for maintenance 
and repair of sewers and ensure infrastructure 
upgrades are delivered ahead of the site being 
occupied through a housing phasing plan. New 
connections into either of the trunk sewers 
crossing the site will not be allowed.  The existing 
connection at the north end of the site is the 
most likely connection point.

15.85 This site comprises the former Deptford Green 
School, Upper School site, and associated 
grounds. It has been cleared and is now vacant 
following the relocation of the school. A new 
public park, Charlottenburg Park, has recently

Edward Street and Amersham Vale. 
2. New and improved public realm in accordance 
with a site-wide public realm strategy, including 
safe and legible walking and cycle routes through 
the site to Charlottenburg Park.
3. Protect and enhance the amenity value provided 
by Charlottenburg Park. 15.87 Development guidelines
1. The layout of the site should be designed to 
open up the site for walking and cycle routes that 
are well-integrated with the surrounding street 
network. This may include a central mews street 
that creates a route across the site.
2. Larger and taller building elements facing 
Charlottenburg Park may be appropriate in order 
to maximise the amenity value of the park, but 
careful consideration will be needed to ensure 
this is not compromised. A taller element at the 
northeast corner of the site, marking the corner 
of Amersham Vale and Edward Street, may also 
be acceptable.
3. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
4. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water to manage surface water, divert 
existing sewers where applicable, allow access 
for maintenance and repair of sewers and ensure

Albany Theatre on the site, in line with Policy 
CI1 (Safeguarding and securing community 
infrastructure).
3. Development must be designed to respond 
positively to the setting of the Conservation Area 
and the Grade II listed Deptford Ramp. 4. Delivery of new and improved public realm in 
accordance with a site-wide public realm strategy.
5. Positive frontages along Douglas Way and Idonia 
Street to protect and enhance the amenity of the 
market along Douglas Way.
15.91 Development guidelines
1. The bulk, scale, massing and height of buildings 
should ensure no unacceptable level of over 
shadowing of the existing open space in the 
northern part of the site, or any re-provided 
open space, and the residential properties to the 
north of the site. To avoid overshadowing taller 
elements should be concentrated to west of the 
site where the building would need to ‘turn the 
corner’ successfully.
2. Development should create positive frontages 
onto Idonia Street and Douglas Way, with active 
ground floor frontages incorporated into the 
development wherever possible, taking into 
account the operational requirements of the 
theatre and the need to protect the public realm 
and the market at Douglas Way.
3. The Albany Theatre is a non-designated heritage 
asset of historical, social and cultural significance. 
Deptford Conservation Area lies immediately east 
of the site. To the east of the site lies the Grade 
II listed Deptford Ramp, the oldest surviving 
railway structure in London, and was restored as 
part of the Deptford Market Yard development. 
The site also lies within an Area of Archaeological 
Priority.
5804. The community gardens are Neighbourhood 
Open Space and development proposals will be 
considered with reference to GR2 Open Space.
5. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable and ensure infrastructure upgrades 
are delivered ahead of the site being occupied 
through a housing phasing plan. New 
connections into the Douglas Way trunk sewer 
will not be allowed.

Site allocation
15.93 Comprehensive redevelopment for residential 
uses.
Opportunities
15.94 This site comprises the former Tidemill Primary 
School and associated grounds, the Old Tidemill 
Wildlife Gardens and 16 existing properties. It is 
located within Deptford District Centre. It is now 
vacant following the relocation of the school. 
The site immediately to the north comprises 
the Deptford Lounge library and community 
facility. The land will be brought back into active 
use through redevelopment, with new high 
quality housing.  Development will also enable 
public realm enhancements to improve the site’s 
relationship with the Deptford Lounge, and also 
support the vitality and viability of the town 
centre. 15.95 Development requirements
1. Retention of the former main school building and 
annexe, with conversions and roof extensions and 
the development of new additional buildings. 
2. Positive frontages along Frankham Street and 
Reginald Road.
3. Delivery of new and improved public realm and 
public open space in accordance with a site-wide 
public realm strategy, including a new landscaped 
square, framed by new and converted buildings.
4. The site must be fully re-integrated with the 
surrounding street network to improve ac-cess 
and permeability into and through the town 
centre, with enhanced walking and cy-cle 
connections to the Deptford Lounge, Griffin 
Square, and the wider town centre ar-ea. This 
will require a hierarchy of routes with clearly 
articulated east-west and north-south corridors. 
The site must also facilitate cycle lanes along 
Deptford Church Street.
15.96 Development guidelines
1. The design of development should respond 
positively to the surrounding building heights, 
particularly the retained school buildings, and 
take account of the proximity to the adjoining 
Deptford High Street and St Paul’s Church 
Conservation Area and nearby Deptford Creek 
Conservation Area, including the Crossfield 
estate, which is of heritage significance.  
Development should not be visible from within 
Deptford High Street and should not detract 
from the setting, character and appearance of 
Griffin Square.
583
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
15 LEWISHAM’S NORTH AREA2. To create a distinctive identity, different designs 
and scales across the site should be used to 
reflect different site conditions, spatial character 
and distinctive features and buildings that 
already exist on-site.
3. A cohesive public realm should create strong 
relationships to public realm elsewhere in 
Deptford. New public realm should be able to 
accommodate a range of appropriate activities 
whilst retaining an overall tranquil environment. 
Destinations should be created through a series 
of courtyard spaces and landscaping should be 
used to soften spaces and create an interesting 
streetscape. 
4. Consideration should be given to the retention 
of mature trees, especially those adjacent to 
the annexe and along the Frankham House 
boundary.
5. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
6. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water to minimise impacts on 
groundwater, manage surface water, divert 
existing sewers where applicable and ensure 
infrastructure upgrades are delivered ahead of 
the site being occupied.  There is potential for 
discharge in Deptford Creek. New connections 
into the Deptford Church Street trunk sewer will 
not be allowed and impacts on the Deptford 
Storm Overflow should be avoided.

to Deptford Creek.
Opportunities
15.99 The site comprises a Locally Significant Industrial 
Site located within the Deptford Creekside 
Cultural Quarter, in proximity to the Faircharm 
estate and Trinity Laban Centre. It is located 
within the Deptford Creek/Greenwich Riverside 
Opportunity Area that seeks to deliver new 
jobs and homes. It is occupied by a range of 
commercial uses, including workshops and 
offices focussed around the creative industries 
and has 7 existing residential units. Creekside 
Road runs through the site. Redevelopment and 
site intensification, along with the co-location 
of commercial and other uses will provide a 
more optimal use of land and support local 
area regeneration and the Cultural Quarter.  
Development will also enable public realm and 
environmental enhancements to improve the 
quality of the Creekside area 15.100 Development requirements
1. Landowner must work in partnership and in 
accordance with a masterplan, to ensure the 
appropriate co-location, phasing and balance of 
employment and other uses across the site and 
the emerging character of consented development 
schemes, in line with Policy DM3 (Masterplans and 
comprehensive development)
2. Development must not result in a net loss of 
industrial capacity, or compromise the function of 
the employment location, in line with Policy EC6 
(Locally Significant Industrial Sites). 
3. Positive frontages along Deptford Creek, Deptford 
Church Street and Creekside, with active ground 
floor frontages incorporated into the strong street 
edge provided by the historic boundary walls.
4. Delivery of new and improved public realm and 
open space, in accordance with a site-wide public 
realm strategy, including:
a. Waterside access and amenity space, with 
provision of a new public path along Deptford 
Creek linking to Waterlink Way, 
b. widened pavements at pinch points in 
Creekside, and 
c. the creation of new yards behind the street 
frontage. 
d. better inter-connectivity with Deptford High 
Street through a green corridor.
5. Development proposals must protect and seek to 
enhance green infrastructure, includ-ing the SINC, 
the intertidal terrace and the sand martin bank 
at Deptford Creek, taking into account the River 
Corridor Improvement Plan SPD.
6. Development proposals must protect and sustain 
the existing boat houses, Lewisham’s boat dwelling 
community, as this distinctive riverside setting 
forms part of one of the important characteristics 
of the Creekside Conservation Area.
58615.101 Development guidelines
1. Non-employment uses, including residential 
uses, must be sensitively integrated into the 
development in order to ensure the protection 
of amenity for all site users, along with safe 
and convenient access. This will require careful 
consideration of the operational requirements of 
existing and potential future employment uses.
2. Development proposals should prioritise the 
integration of new workspace, artists’ studio 
space and cultural facilities that contribute to 
the Deptford Creekside Cultural Quarter and 
other uses, including residential uses, must not 
adversely impact on the Cultural Quarter, in line 
with the Agent of Change principle.
3. The development should be designed having 
regard to the character and appearance of the 
Conservation Area, the buildings within it that 
make a positive contribution, the green and 
open spaces that are integral to the character of 
the Crossfield’s estate and provide amenity for 
residents and the Creek itself. 
4. Building heights will need to have regard to 
impacts on the existing boundaries that make 
a positive contribution to the character and 
appearance of the Creekside Conservation 
Area, (including the historic Crossfield’s Estate) 
and create a drop in scale from the heights on 
Deptford Church Street.  They should also have 
regard to the setting of Grade I Listed St Paul’s 
Church in Deptford, grade II listed Mumford’s 
Mill (RBG), grade II listed Railway Viaduct and 
the setting of Deptford High Street and St Paul’s 
Church Conservation Area.5. Development should be informed by an 
understanding of the site’s historic significance, 
in particular it’s past river related industrial 
activity, and respond to this through improv-
ing access to the Creek, creating new views of 
it and of significant historic buildings on its 
banks, creating opportunities for river related 
occupations, and revealing its history and 
presence through art, design, materials, layout 
and uses. 
6. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
7. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable, and ensure infrastructure upgrades 
are delivered ahead of the site being occupied 
through a housing phasing plan. There is 
potential for discharge into Deptford Creek.

viaduct arches to Ha’penny Bridge.
589
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
15 LEWISHAM’S NORTH AREA7. Development must improve the ecological quality 
and amenity value of the riverside environment 
at Deptford Creek, taking into account the River 
Corridor Improvement Plan SPD.
8. 8. Development proposals must protect and seek 
to enhance green infrastructure,  the intertidal 
terrace,  the sand martin bank at Deptford Creek 
and the SINC at Creekside Discovery Centre, The 
Creek and at Sue Godfrey Park.
9. Development proposals must incorporate ways of 
revealing and conveying the history and heritage 
of the site and its surroundings, including 
riverine, railway, industrial and social history, as 
well as marking the entrance to Deptford and the 
borough by train. 
10. Development should not impact on the World 
Heritage Site or other heritage assets within 
Royal Greenwich such as the Grade II Listed 
former Greenwich Town Hall and its’ prominent 
tower. 
15.106 Development guidelines
1. Development proposals should prioritise the 
integration of new workspace, artists’ studio 
space and cultural facilities that contribute to the 
Deptford Creekside Cultural Quarter. Other main 
town centre uses should be complementary in 
nature, ensuring no adverse impact on the vitality 
and viability of Deptford High Street.
2. The development should be designed so that the 
Cockpit Arts building retains a visual presence 
from Creekside, including where the building is to 
be re-provided.
3. The design of the development should enable 
the viaduct arches to be opened up and 
refurbished for commercial, cultural and/or 
community uses. 4. Artist studio space should be provided to 
complement creative uses that exist to the north 
and south of the site (Kent Wharf, Faircharm and 
Cockpit Arts), which together form an important 
cluster in the Cultural Quarter.
5. The potential for taller building elements to 
reflect the surroundings should be considered as 
part of a design led approach, and should ensure 
minimal impact on the Grade II listed railway 
viaduct and the Lifting Bridge Structure as well 
as the setting of the Grade I Listed St Paul’s 
Church in Deptford and the LVMF panoramic 
view from Blackheath Point. Taller elements 
should be located in the south eastern corner of 
the site, marking the junction of Creek and the 
railway viaduct. 
6. The proposed residential development located in 
close proximity to the safeguarded Brewery Wharf 
should be designed to minimise the potential 
for conflicts of use and disturbance, including 
utilising the site layout, building orientation, uses 
and appropriate materials to design out potential 
conflicts, in line with the Agent of Change 
principle.
7. The design of the development should respond 
positively to the character and nature of Deptford 
Creek and the existing street pattern and ensure 
increased permeability through the site with 
public access to a route running along Deptford 
Creek that connects into the wider Waterlink Way.  
Development should not result in a reduction in 
existing footway or carriageway space. 
8. Connections running south through the railway 
viaduct and east-west from Creekside along the 
northern edge of the viaduct should also be 
explored. 
5909. The design of the site should take account 
of views from within the Deptford Creekside 
Conservation Area, along Creekside, from the 
east bank of the Creek and from within Sue 
Godfrey Park Site of Importance for Nature 
Conservation.  Development should ensure new 
buildings maximise the aspect over the waterway 
and enable longer distance views beyond the 
waterway.
10. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
11. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water to manage surface water, divert 
existing sewers where applicable, allow access 
for maintenance and repair of sewers and ensure 
infrastructure upgrades are delivered ahead of 
the site being occupied. There is potential for 
discharge into Deptford Creek. New connections 
into the Creekside trunk sewer will not be 
allowed.
12. Network Rail should be consulted on 
development and design options including 
an east-west link along the northern side of 
the viaduct and access through the arch for a 
potential north-south link.

15.111 Development guidelines
1. Development proposals should prioritise the 
integration of new workspace, artists’ studio 
space and cultural facilities that contribute to the 
Deptford Creekside Cultural Quarter. Other main 
town centre uses should be complementary in 
nature, ensuring no adverse impact on the vitality 
and viability of Deptford High Street. A new 
education / community facility will be supported 
in principle, particularly where this enhances 
existing provision associated with the Trinity 
Laban Centre.

conflicts, in line with the Agent of Change 
principle.
4. Development should respond positively to 
Deptford Creek, which is a Site of Importance for 
Nature Conservation (Metropolitan importance) 
and forms part of the Waterlink Way. Protection 
should be given to the intertidal terrace and sand 
martin bank that have been previously enhanced, 
create ecological zones and a new tidal terrace, 
whilst retaining the right to navigate.
5. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.6. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water to manage surface water, divert 
existing sewers where applicable, and ensure 
infrastructure upgrades are delivered ahead of 
the site being occupied.  There is potential for 
discharge into Deptford Creek.
7. Development should be designed to protect the 
biodiversity and amenity value of the nearby Sue 
Godfrey Park, which is partly a Site of Importance 
for Nature Conservation.
8. SUDS should be an integral part of the 
development, seeking to reduce rainwater runoff 
into Deptford Creek.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVEContext and character
16.1 Lewisham’s East Area comprises the 
neighbourhoods of Blackheath, Lee and Grove 
Park. It is made up of historic villages that 
formed along the route to Greenwich, which 
expanded dramatically with the arrival of the 
railways. Burnt Ash Hill is an important historic 
north-south route that connects from Blackheath 
to Lee. The area forms the eastern edge of the 
Borough and this is reinforced by the continuous 
stretch of green and open spaces that run from 
the riverside and Blackheath in the area’s north 
to Elmstead Wood in the south. This network 
of green infrastructure, including the heath at 
Blackheath and the Green Chain Walk connecting 
green spaces, is one of the area’s defining 
features.
16.2 The East Area has a predominantly suburban 
character. This is reflected by the built form 
and layout of the Victorian terraces, the formal 
historic village of Blackheath, Georgian and 
Regency villas, as well as 20th century housing, 
interwar homes and Council estates. Residential 
developments typically feature wide plots, large 
gardens and generous street sections. The area’s 
neighbourhoods are therefore some of the lowest 
density in the Borough. 
16.3 The East Area contains the District Centres 
of Blackheath and Lee Green. Blackheath is a 
significant historic area whose character centres 
on its heritage assets and strong village identity, 
along with the open expanses of the heath. 
Blackheath town centre has a rich character 
and village qualities that make it a key visitor 
destination, with an active evening and night-
time economy. Lee Green has a distinctive 
historic character with a significant number of listed buildings. It is one of the Borough’s 
smallest District Centres thatserves the local 
neighbourhood and communities with a mix 
of shops and services. It includes several large 
format retail units and the Leegate Shopping 
Centre, the latter of which was built in the 
1960s. The centre suffers from areas of poorer 
quality public realm, with two busy roads forming 
a junction that dominates the centre of the High 
Street. Vacancy rates indicate that Lee Green is 
not performing as well as other District Centres in 
the Borough.
16.4 Grove Park is located to the southeast of the 
Borough and is somewhat disconnected from 
its surrounding neighbourhoods. This is in 
part owing to railway lines to the northeast 
and southwest, as well as the South Circular, 
which create physical barriers to movement and 
contribute to severance. Baring Road is a key 
route within the neighbourhood, as well as the 
historic corridor of Burnt Ash Road. They are 
dominated by vehicles, suffer from traffic and 
congestion, and have a poorer quality public 
realm, limiting opportunities for movement by 
walking and cycling. Grove Park station and the 
Local Centre comprise a gateway and focal point 
in the neighbourhood.
16.5 The Quaggy River, the upper reaches of which 
are known as Kyd Brook, passes through parts 
of Lewisham’s East Area at Chinbrook Meadows 
in Grove Park and Lee Green. At Chinbrook 
Meadows, the river channel has been naturalised 
with river banks reintroduced to encourage 
wildlife. Much of the subsequent length of the 
river to the boundary with the London Borough 
of Bromley is within concrete channels, or has 
been culverted.
598Vision
Figure 16.1: East area16.6 By 2040 the abundance of high quality parks, 
green and open spaces in the East area will make 
it a distinctive part of Lewisham. This includes 
the open expanses of heath at Blackheath which 
provide the setting for the Maritime Greenwich 
World Heritage Site and the village character of 
Blackheath District Centre. These assets will help 
to strengthen the area’s visitor economy and 
reinforce its role as a key destination in London. 
The character and function of the town centres 
that formed along the historic route to Blackheath, 
including Grove Park and Lee Green, will be 
re-examined to ensure they remain thriving and 
vital hubs of community, commercial and cultural 
activity. Public realm improvements along and 
across major roads and railways will enhance 
movement between town centres and green 
spaces, opening opportunities for everyone to 
benefit from.
16.7 The revitalisation of the area’s District and Local 
Centres will ensure they remain thriving hubs of 
community and commercial activity as well as 
focal points for new housing, including a high 
proportion of genuinely affordable housing. The 
redevelopment of Leegate Shopping Centre will 
act as a catalyst for the renewal and revitalisation 
of Lee Green District Centre, making it a vibrant, 
welcoming and accessible place. The centre 
will feature enhanced gateways, aided by the 
transformation of Lee High Road (A20) and other 
roads by applying the Healthy Streets Approach, 
with public realm enhancements that make 
walking, cycling and the use of public transport 
safer and more convenient. The Local Centres 
of Lee Station, Staplehurst Road and Grove 
Park will play an integral role in supporting their 
neighbourhoods. New development will deliver 
public realm and access improvements, enhancing the station approaches, making the centres more 
attractive for visitors and businesses. Blackheath 
Village District Centre will build on its unique 
qualities as a visitor destination with a vibrant 
evening and night-time economy. Elsewhere, 
the character of established residential areas will 
be reinforced, with their sensitive intensification 
providing for improvements throughout the wider 
area.
16.8 Residents and visitors will benefit from excellent 
access to high quality parks, heath, open and 
green spaces. The area’s linear network of green 
infrastructure, which spans from the riverside and 
Blackheath in the north to Chinbrook Meadows 
in the south, will remain one of its predominant 
features. This will be celebrated by the distinction 
of an ‘urban national park’ in Grove Park, 
forming part of an integrated District Park, along 
with the open spaces at Blackheath. A network of 
high quality walking and cycle routes, including 
the Green Chain Walk, will link open and green 
spaces both within and outside of the borough.

Table
TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION OUR KEY SPATIAL OBJECTIVES (NOT LISTED IN ORDER OF PRIORITY) 
ARE TO:
1Re-establish Lee Green District Centre as a welcoming and thriving hub of commercial, cultural and community 
activity. Deliver public realm improvements together with high quality, mixed-use developments through the 
renewal of Leegate Shopping Centre and other town centre sites. Improve movement and safety within and 
through the centre by addressing the dominance of vehicles and traffic congestion at the centre’s main junction.
2Preserve and enhance the distinctive qualities of Blackheath Village District Centre whilst building on its 
strengths as a key visitor destination.
3Reinforce the role of Grove Park Local Centre in supporting the neighbourhood and local communities. Improve 
the quality of the centre, including its streetscape, townscape and environment, through the redevelopment 
of larger sites within the centre and the delivery public realm enhancements, particularly around the station 
approach.
4Strengthen the role of Lee Station Local Centre in supporting the neighbourhood and local communities. 
Improve the quality of the townscape around Lee Station, and the station approach, through the renewal of 
sites near to the Local Centre.
5Protect and enable the renewal of industrial land at Blackheath Hill LSIS and other smaller industrial sites 
through the delivery of new employment-led mixed-use development.
6Transform the South Circular (A205), Lee High Road (A20), Burnt Ash Road/Baring Road (A2212), Lee Road 
(A212) and other major roads using the Healthy Streets Approach, with public realm improvements that make 
walking, cycling and use of public transport safer and more convenient.

602LEA1 East Area place principles
A Development proposals must contribute to 
the delivery of Good Growth with reference 
to Policy OL1 (Delivering an Open Lewisham) 
and in doing so, demonstrate how they have 
responded positively to and will support the 
achievement of the key spatial objectives for 
the East Area.
B Development proposals affecting the Maritime 
Greenwich World Heritage Site Buffer Zone 
must protect and preserve the significance, 
integrity and authenticity of its ‘Outstanding 
Universal Value’, as well as its setting and the 
views to and from it, with reference to Policy 
HE2 (Designated heritage assets).
C Development proposals must respond 
positively to the historic and village character 
of Blackheath District Centre and its wider 
setting, as well the architectural qualities 
of buildings that contribute to its local 
distinctiveness. A wide range of commercial, 
cultural and community uses will be supported 
within the centre in order to secure its long-
term vitality and viability. A carefully managed 
approach to new development will be taken 
to maintain the centre’s village character and 
reinforce its role in supporting the visitor, 
evening and night-time economy, whilst 
ensuring the locality benefits from a high 
standard of amenity. The Healthy Streets 
Approach will be supported in and around 
Blackheath Village to improve accessibility by 
walking and cycling.D Development proposals must support the 
transformation of the South Circular (A205), Lee 
High Road (A20), Burnt Ash Road/Baring Road 
(A2212) and Lee Road (A212) by applying the 
Healthy Streets Approach  in accordance with 
Policy TR3 (Healthy streets as part of healthy 
neighbourhoods).  They must be designed 
to create or enhance walking routes and 
cycleways through the provision of public realm 
improvements, positive frontages and active 
ground floor frontages along the roads, where 
appropriate. 
E The redevelopment and intensification of 
sites within the Lee Green District Centre and 
brownfield land fronting the key corridors of Lee 
High Road (between Weigall Road and Boone 
Street/Old Road), Baring Road (between Grove 
Park station and Heather Road/Bramdean 
Crescent), and along the South Circular will 
be supported where development proposals 
respond positively to local character.
F Development proposals should seek to address 
elements of the built environment that 
segregate neighbourhoods and places from 
one another. This includes the consideration of 
public realm improvements to address severance 
caused by the South Circular (A205), other 
major roads and rail lines, particularly within the 
northeast and southwest parts of the East Area.

604G Lee Station is designated a Local Centre 
reflecting the role it plays in the provision of 
local services and community facilities, along 
with its accessible location near Lee station. To 
help secure the long-term vitality and viability 
of the centre, development proposals should:
a. Be designed to enhance the character of the 
townscape, access to and along the station 
approach and the centre, including by 
improving shopfronts, public realm and the 
legibility of walking routes and cycleways; 
and
b. Facilitate the renewal of employment sites in 
proximity to the centre and station to secure 
a complementary mix of commercial uses 
and modern workspace.
H The sensitive intensification of established 
residential neighbourhoods will be supported 
where new development proposals respond 
positively to their distinctive local and historic 
character, including the landscape setting. 
Development proposals must have regard 
to the Small Sites Guidance SPD, where 
appropriate.
I Opportunities should be taken to direct new 
investment to the Grove Park neighbourhood 
with reference to Policy LEA3 (Strategic Area 
for Regeneration, Grove Park).  Development 
proposals should respond positively to the 
character and design qualities of the Chinbrook 
Estate.J The network of green infrastructure within 
the East Area and its surrounds, including 
outside of the Borough, contributes to the 
area’s distinctive character and environmental 
qualities.  Development proposals must 
contribute to protecting and enhancing this 
network of green infrastructure, with reference 
to Policy LEA4 (Linear network of green 
infrastructure).
K Development proposals must help to ensure 
the East Area benefits from a high quality 
network of walking routes and cycleways that 
connect neighbourhoods and places, including 
green spaces and waterways, with reference to 
Policy GR4 (Lewisham Links).
L The River Quaggy is a defining feature of the 
East Area which development proposals must 
respond positively to. Development proposals 
must maximise opportunities to improve the 
ecological quality and amenity value of the 
river environment, including by facilitating the 
provision of new and enhanced connections 
to and along the waterfront. This includes 
opportunities to deculvert and naturalise the 
River Quaggy near Lee High Road, as well as 
to deliver improved access and views to it, 
particularly around the town centre.

16 LEWISHAM’S EAST AREALEA2 Lee Green district centre and surrounds
A Development proposals must demonstrate 
how they will contribute to securing the long-
term vitality and viability of Lee Green District 
centre, including by enhancing the place 
qualities of the centre as well as reinforcing its 
role as a key focal point for community activity 
in the East Area. Development proposals 
must contribute to a coordinated process of 
town centre renewal that responds positively 
to the area’s distinctive character. They must 
also deliver a complementary mix of main 
town centre uses, along with new housing, 
whilst ensuring that the centre’s predominant 
commercial and community role is maintained 
and enhanced.
B The comprehensive redevelopment of the sites 
at Leegate Shopping Centre, Sainsbury’s Lee 
Green and the land at Lee High Road and Lee 
Road will together form a central focus for 
the renewal and revitalisation of the District 
Centre. Development proposals at these sites 
must be delivered in accordance with relevant 
site allocation policies.
C Development proposals must contribute 
to enhancing the public realm by applying 
the Healthy Streets Approach. They should 
promote and enable movement by walking, 
cycling and the use of public transport to 
make the town centre a significantly more 
accessible, safer, healthier and attractive 
environment. This will require that a clear 
hierarchy of streets is established within 
the wider town centre area, along with a 
cohesive and legible network of walking 
routes and cycleways running through and/
or connecting key commercial, leisure and cultural destinations, public transport nodes, 
public open spaces and residential areas.  
Particular consideration will need to be given to 
movements along and across the main junction, 
Lee High Road, Lee Road, Burnt Ash Road, 
Taunton Road, Leyland Road and Hedgley Street.
D Development proposals should respond 
positively to the evolving urban character of 
the town centre and its immediate surrounds. 
Development should be designed to provide 
for an appropriate transition in scale, bulk, 
mass, height and character between the 
centre, its edges and surrounding residential 
neighbourhoods, with generous setbacks 
provided along major roads and movement 
corridors.
E Development proposals should be designed 
with positive frontages and active ground floor 
frontages within the town centre and at its 
edges. In order to ensure development creates 
a positive relationship with the public realm, 
special attention should be given to design at 
the ground floor and podium levels of buildings.
F Development proposals must maximise 
opportunities to improve the ecological quality 
and amenity value of the river environment. This 
includes measures to deculvert and naturalise 
the River Quaggy and to improve public access 
to it around Lee High Road.
606LEA3 Strategic Area for Regeneration, Grove Park
A A Strategic Area for Regeneration is 
designated in the Local Plan. This covers the 
entirety of  South Area and parts of Grove 
Park neighbourhood in the East Area, as 
defined by the Local Plan. A partnership 
approach will be pursued in order to ensure 
that public and private sector investment 
is secured within the area, and that this 
investment is coordinated to successfully 
deliver regeneration and area improvements in 
collaboration with local communities. 
B Development proposals and stakeholders 
should seek opportunities to tackle 
inequalities and the environmental, economic 
and social barriers that contribute to 
deprivation and the need for regeneration in 
this area, taking into account policies for the 
wider Strategic Area for Regeneration in the 
Borough’s south, as set out in Policy LSA2 
(Strategic Area for Regeneration).

16 LEWISHAM’S EAST AREA608LEA4 Linear network of green infrastructure 
A The East Area contains a linear network of 
green infrastructure that will be protected 
and enhanced. Development proposals must 
respond positively to the linear network of 
green infrastructure and its multifunctional 
value, with reference to Policy GR1 (Green 
infrastructure and Lewisham’s Green Grid). 
This includes  its role as a vital environmental 
and recreational asset within the Borough 
and feature which contributes to the 
distinctiveness of the Blackheath, Lee and 
Grove Park neighbourhoods.
B Development proposals should maximise 
opportunities to reinforce and enhance the 
character, amenity and environmental value 
of the linear network of green infrastructure, 
including by:
a. Integrating greening measures to enhance 
existing green linkages, and create new 
linkages, between the different elements 
of green infrastructure within the area, 
particularly to support the achievement of a 
continuous linear and connected ecological 
network;
b. Seeking opportunities to restore or 
introduce habitats, particularly priority 
habitats, to support species and enhance 
the biodiversity value of the network;
c. Maintaining and enhancing the Green Chain 
walk as a key route for public access to and 
between spaces within the network;d. Making provision for safe public access 
to and throughout the network, where 
appropriate, including by improving or 
introducing east-west and north-south 
walking routes and cycleways, pathways and 
access points, such as gates; and
e. Ensuring that development is designed in a 
manner that is sensitive to character of the 
network and the landscape setting.
C The effective management of the linear 
network of green infrastructure, including 
initiatives that promote interpretation and 
appreciation of the network (including its 
local, historical and ecological significance), 
will be encouraged.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
16 LEWISHAM’S EAST AREA Lewisham’s East Area
16.9 Lewisham’s East Area is largely made of up the 
historic villages that formed along the route 
to Greenwich. These greatly influenced the 
area’s development and the predominantly 
suburban character that persists today. The East 
Area will play a more complementary role in 
accommodating the Borough’s future growth. 
This is owing to its expansive historic and natural 
environments along with the scarcity of large 
development sites. Together these factors limit 
opportunities for bringing forward substantial 
new development. Yet generating investment 
to improve the quality of neighbourhoods 
and opportunities for local people remains a 
priority. This is particularly in the Borough’s 
Area for Regeneration, which extends to parts 
of Grove Park, where interventions are required 
to address the causes of deprivation. The Local 
Plan sets out a strategy to help facilitate new 
investment within the East Area, maximising 
opportunities that are available whilst ensuring 
growth is effectively coordinated, with a clear 
framework that responds to the area’s valued 
built and natural assets. This includes Blackheath, 
the heath and the Maritime Greenwich World 
Heritage Site Buffer Zone.
16.10 Town and local centres present the main 
opportunities for accommodating growth 
and securing new investment. The East Area’s 
strategic development sites are generally 
located within or around these centres. There is 
significant potential to reinforce the role of Lee 
Green District Centre through targeted renewal. 
It contains a number of sites, including the 
Leegate Shopping Centre, whose comprehensive 
redevelopment will significantly enhance the 
place qualities of the centre whilst delivering new housing, improved retail provision and 
community facilities. There are also a number of 
local centres that play a vital role as community 
hubs serving the area’s neighbourhoods, and 
where new development can help to support 
their long-term vitality and viability. This includes 
Grove Park, Lee Station and Staplehurst Road. 
Blackheath Village is an important visitor 
destination whose strategic role as a Night Time 
Economy hub is supported through the plan.
16.11 To make the best use of land and maximise 
opportunities for new investment in the East 
Area, the Local Plan seeks to facilitate the 
intensification of its neighbourhoods. The 
development of small housing sites provides a 
key means to realise the sensitive intensification 
of established residential areas. The Lewisham 
Characterisation Study (2019) has informed this 
approach and is useful in indicating where there 
is such scope in the East Area. We have prepared 
the Small Sites SPD to identify opportunities 
and to help ensure that all such development 
responds positively to its local context. 
Intensification of employment land is also 
promoted, particularly to deliver new workspace 
and secure the long-term viability of employment 
sites. Site intensification will be delivered 
primarily through the co-location of employment 
and other compatible uses on LSIS at Blackheath 
Hill and Manor Lane.
61016.12 The Local Plan seeks to deliver a well-integrated 
network of high quality walking and cycle 
routes. The main aim is to realise a significant 
shift in journeys made by vehicles to more 
sustainable modes. The transformation of the 
South Circular (A205, Baring Road) and Lee 
High Road (A20) into Healthy Streets underpins 
this approach. These are principal movement 
corridors within the East Area, and have potential 
for accommodating growth and improving 
connections between neighbourhoods and 
places. Elsewhere, the Healthy Streets Approach 
will be supported in order to deliver high quality 
walking and cycling corridors thorugh the East 
Area from Blackheath Village, via Lee Road, 
through Lee Green junction, along Burnt Ash 
Road and Baring Road up to and including Grove 
Park town centre.
16.13 The linear network of green infrastructure is 
a defining feature of the Blackheath, Lee and 
Grove Park neighbourhoods and contributes 
to the East Area’s distinctiveness. The network 
includes an expansive series of open spaces 
and parks, the heath at Blackheath, nature 
conservation sites and the river corridor, along 
with walking and cycle routes that are of strategic 
importance, including the Green Chain Walk. It 
is imperative that the environmental and place 
qualities of this network of green infrastructure 
are protected and enhanced. The Local Plan sets 
the strategic priorities for the network which 
community groups, including neighbourhood 
forums, are encouraged to support, whether 
through community projects or neighbourhood 
plans. The East Lewisham Links are centred on 
the network of green infrastructure, recognising 
the priority given to improving public access to it, 
particularly by walking and cycling.

that taller elements are located and designed 
to avoid adverse impacts on local character.  
This includes consideration of the Blackheath 
Conservation Area, along with Listed Buildings 
and Locally Listed Buildings to the east of the 
site, on Dartmouth Row.
3. The design of development should respond 
positively to the character of existing residential 
properties surrounding the site.  In particular, the 
heights and style of adjacent properties within 
the Blackheath Conservation Area to the south 
and east of the site and the Listed Buildings and 
Locally Listed Buildings to the east of the site, on 
Dartmouth Row.
4. Development should have regard to the

residential uses. 
Opportunities 
16.21 The site comprises the Blackheath Hill Locally 
Significant Industrial Site. Redevelopment and 
site intensification, along with the co-location of 
commercial and other uses, will provide a more

development in order to ensure the protection 
of amenity for all site users, along with safe 
and convenient access. This will require careful 
consideration of the operational requirements of 
existing and potential future employment uses.
2. Development should be designed having 
regard to the heritage assets adjacent to the 
site, including the setting of the Blackheath 
Conservation Area, as well as Listed and Locally 
Listed Buildings to the east, on Dartmouth Row.
3. The irregular shape of the site will require 
careful consideration of site access and layout, 
particularly for commercial and servicing vehicles.

buildings and reconfiguration of spaces to 
facilitate a street-based layout with new and 
improved routes, both into and through the site, 
along with public open space and public realm 
enhancements.Opportunities
16.27 This site takes up a prominent position within 
Lee Green district town centre. It is currently 
occupied by the 1960s Leegate Shopping Centre, 
two office blocks (Leegate House and Cantilever 
House), a multi-level car park, a community 
centre and housing. It is key to the renewal and 
revitalisation of the town centre, and will play a 
critical role in linking sites and neighbourhoods 
surrounding it. Comprehensive redevelopment 
will deliver a significant amount of new housing 
together with modern retail and employment 
space, leisure, community and cultural facilities to 
support the long-term vitality and viability of the 
town centre. Development will also enable public 
realm enhancements to improve connections to 
and through the area.
16.28 Development requirements
1. The site must be re-integrated with the 
surrounding street network to improve access and 
permeability into and through the town centre. 
This will require significant reconfiguration and 
re-orientation of existing buildings and spaces 
to achieve a hierarchy of routes with clearly 
articulated east-west and north-south corridors.
2. Positive frontages, with active ground floor 
frontages within the Primary Shopping Area and 
along key routes.
3. Delivery of new and improved public realm and 
open space, in accordance with a site-wide public 
realm strategy.
4. Provision of community infrastructure to meet 
demand arising from the development, including 
a new health facility in partnership with the CCG, 
NHS and other health bodies.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
16 LEWISHAM’S EAST AREA16.29 Development guidelines
1. Careful consideration must be given to the 
integration of walking and cycle routes through 
the site to Eltham Road, Burnt Ash Road, Leyland 
Road and Taunton Road.
2. Development should make provision for a range 
of floorplate sizes to accommodate a variety of 
main town centre uses.
3. Development should make more optimal use of 
the land by reviewing options for the existing 
multi-storey car park. 
4. Public realm should be redistributed across 
the site, with a new public square set back 
from Burnt Ash Road.  Consideration should 
be given to external seating areas, landscaping 
and playspace as well as communal courtyard 
gardens, private amenity spaces and improved 
public realm along Eltham Road and Burnt Ash 
Road.
5. Development should contribute to a healthy 
streets corridor and take account of the strategic 
cycle routes running north-south along B212 Lee 
Road and A2212 Burnt Ash Road/Baring Road 
and east-west along A20 Lee High Road/Eltham 
Road.
6. Large canopy tree planting on south east corner 
and along Burnt Ash Road should be used to 
improve the public realm and link the Burnt Ash 
Road Avenue of trees on the opposite side of the 
street with the mature trees on the site.  7. Development should take account of a Grade ll 
listed fire station and a locally listed Old Tigers 
Head Pub and seek to reinstate connections to 
Lee Green’s historic past, rather than replicating 
the busy traffic junction that now dominates the 
area. The local history information board that 
currently exists on the south east side of the site 
should be protected or replaced and incorporated 
into the new scheme. 
8. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
9. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable and ensure infrastructure upgrades 
are delivered ahead of the site being occupied 
through a housing phasing plan. New 
connections into the trunk sewer will not be 
allowed.

16.31 This site takes up a prominent position within 
Lee Green district town centre. It is currently 
occupied by a large format retail building 
and surface level car parking. Comprehensive 
redevelopment and site intensification, along 
with the introduction of a wider range of uses, 
will provide a more optimal use of land to

main town centre uses and allow for the re-
provision of a supermarket. 
2. Development should make more optimal use of 
the land by reviewing options for the existing car

3. Development should be designed to enhance 
movement by walking and cycling, with improved 
permeability through the site, in particular 
providing new routes between Hedgley Street, 
Brightfield Road, Taunton Road and Lee High 
Road. 
4. Development should contribute to a healthy 
streets corridor and take account of the strategic 
cycle routes running north-south along B212 Lee 
Road and A2212 Burnt Ash Road/Baring Road 
and east-west along A20 Lee High Road/Eltham 
5. Development should create a positive frontage 
along Burnt Ash Road and Lee High Road, 
aligned with adjacent properties.  Tree planting 
should be introduced to improve amenity and the 
public realm, filling in the gaps in the avenue of 
trees on Burnt Ash Road.  
6. Development should respond positively to the 
adjoining Lee Manor Conservation Area and the 
Grade II Listed Building Police Station.
7. Staggered building heights should be used to 
respect the surroundings, with smaller grained 
development in the western side of the site to 
avoid overshadowing of existing residential units 
along Brightfield Road and with taller buildings 
located along the southern edge and in the north 
eastern corner of the site, away from the Listed 
Building.  
6248. Development should take account of a locally 
listed Old Tigers Head Pub and seek to reinstate 
connections to Lee Green’s historic past, rather

improve its ecological quality and amenity value.
16.37 Development guidelines
1. The design of development should respond 
positively to the existing terrace at the eastern 
edge of the site, and protect the street scene 
along Lee Road. 
2. Development should contribute to a healthy 
streets corridor and take account of the strategic 
cycle routes running north-south along B212 Lee 
Road and A2212 Burnt Ash Road/Baring Road 
and east-west along A20 Lee High Road/Eltham 
Road.
3. Applicants should work in partnership with the 
Environment Agency and engage with them early 
at pre-application stage, to mitigate against 
flood risk.
4. Development should take account of a locally 
listed Old Tigers Head Pub and seek to reinstate 
connections to Lee Green’s historic past, rather 
than replicating the busy traffic junction that 
now dominates the area.

residential uses. 
Opportunities
16.39 This site comprises a non-designated 
employment site which is located adjacent to 
Burnt Ash local centre. Redevelopment and site 
intensification, along with the introduction of 
a wider range of uses, will enable the delivery 
of new and improved workspace and help to 
support the long-term vitality and viability of the 
local centre. Development will also provide public 
realm enhancements that improve local area 
amenity, with potential new access to Lee station.
16.40 Development requirements
1. The maximum viable amount of employment 
floorspace must be re-provided, in line with 
Policy EC8 (Non-designated employment sites). 
2. A positive frontage and public realm 
improvements along Southbrook Road.
3. Investigate opportunities to, and where feasible, 
improve access to Lee station by creating a new 
access to the site at its south east corner.
4. Development must protect and seek to enhance 
green infrastructure, including the SINC and 
green corridor along the railway embankment.
16.41 Development guidelines
1. There may be scope for the integration of main 
town centre uses, but these uses should be 
restricted to the frontage along Southbrook 
Road and function to complement the existing 
provision at Burnt Ash local centre.
2. Non-employment uses, including residential 
uses, must be sensitively integrated into the 
development in order to ensure the protection of amenity for all site users, along with safe 
and convenient access. This will require careful 
consideration of the operational requirements of 
existing and potential future employment uses.
3. Building heights should be staggered, with taller 
elements located away from existing residential 
properties, the locally listed Northbrook 
Public House and the locally listed two storey 
mews building. Taller elements will be more 
appropriately located adjacent to the railway in 
the southern part of the site.
4. Opportunities should be investigated to remove 
the boundary wall.Screening or communal 
amenity space should be considered to shield the 
back of existing properties on Burnt Ash Road. 
5. In order to support commercial uses, 
development should be designed to ensure 
vehicular access from Southbrook Road.
6. Development should contribute to a Healthy 
Streets corridor and take account of the strategic 
cycle routes running north-south along A2212 
Burnt Ash Hill/Baring Road.
7. Development should respond positively to the 
Lee Manor Conservation Area and the locally 
listed buildings adjacent to the site.
8. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable and ensure infrastructure upgrades 
are delivered ahead of the site being occupied 
through a housing phasing plan.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE17.1 Lewisham’s South Area includes the 
neighbourhoods of Bellingham, Downham and 
Bell Green. It derives much of its character from 
the interwar homes constructed by the London 
County Council (LCC). These estates were 
influenced by ‘garden city’ principles and provide 
for a relatively homogenous form of low density 
housing throughout the area. There are clusters 
of higher density residential uses around Grove 
Park and Beckenham Hill stations, and pockets 
of Victorian housing in Bell Green. The South 
Area contains a number of historic buildings and 
Conservation Areas that also contribute to its 
local character.
17.2 The South Area includes the district town centre 
of Downham that serves local neighbourhoods 
however it has a more limited range of shops 
and services than other district centres. The 
LCC estates strongly influence the character 
Bellingham and Downham, and the area is 
generally characterised by wide residential streets 
punctuated by smaller shopping parades, with 
comparatively fewer community facilities and 
local employment opportunities than elsewhere 
in the Borough. This means that residents often 
have to travel out of the area to access key 
services and jobs. The area experiences some of 
the Borough’s highest levels of deprivation with 
some localities ranking within the 20 per cent 
most deprived in the country. Context and character
17.3 Many of the train stations and town centres in 
the South Area are poorly connected to their 
surrounding neighbourhoods. There are low 
levels of public transport access throughout the 
area and barriers to movement between key 
destinations.  The quality of the public realm is 
poor along key routes such as Bromley Road, 
Southend Lane, Perry Hill, and Stanton Way, with 
many of these roads dominated by vehicles.
17.4 In addition to established residential areas the 
Bell Green neighbourhood contains an expansive 
out-of-centre retail park, which includes large 
format commercial buildings and associated 
car parks. These retail uses are adjoined by the 
site of a former gas holders which has been 
dismantled. Several developments have recently 
been built around  the edges of the retail park.
17.5 The South Area is characterised by its green and 
open spaces, including waterways. The Pool and 
Ravensbourne rivers run north-south through 
the area. The Pool River, in particular, is a key 
feature and provides a valuable natural corridor 
of significant ecological and biodiversity value, 
along with public access to the Waterlink Way. 
Beckenham Place Park is emerging as a key 
visitor destination in London and has recently 
received significant investment, including by a 
new outdoor swimming pond, landscape and 
public realm improvements.
63617.6 By 2040 the distinctive character of the 
South area, derived from its open spaces, river 
valleys and garden city / cottage estates, will 
be celebrated and reinforced. These assets 
and features will provide the wider setting for 
regeneration, building on new and improved 
transport links, including the Bakerloo line 
extension and cycleways. The role and character 
of large tracts of commercial land in Bell Green 
and Lower Sydenham, along with major roads, will 
be re-imagined to provide a high quality, mixed-
use neighbourhood. This new focus for community 
and commercial activity in Lewisham will act as a 
catalyst for growth and investment. Stakeholders 
will work together and alongside communities 
to deliver improvements that address the causes 
of deprivation in the Borough’s south, opening 
opportunities for everyone to benefit from.
17.7 The regeneration of brownfield sites in Bell Green 
and Lower Sydenham will deliver a significant 
amount of new housing, including a high 
proportion of genuinely affordable housing, 
workspace and jobs, community facilities and 
open space. A new mixed-use neighbourhood, 
focussed around a new local centre, will be 
created through the redevelopment of out-of-
centre retail buildings, the former gasholders, 
industrial land around Stanton Way and other 
sites. This will be coordinated by a masterplan, 
prepared through consultation with the local 
community, ensuring the area is well integrated 
with existing neighbourhoods and communities. 
The garden city and cottage character of 
neighbourhoods in Bellingham and Downham will 
be reinforced, with their sensitive intensification 
providing for area improvements and helping to 
ensure people have access to high quality housing 
and living environments.Vision
17.8 The A21 (Bromley Road) and Ringway 
(Southend Lane and Whitefoot Lane) corridors 
will be transformed through the Healthy 
Streets Approach.  This will better connect 
neighbourhoods with public realm enhancements 
that make walking, cycling and the use of public 
transport safer and more convenient. Along these 
corridors, opportunities will be taken to renew 
brownfield land and underused sites to create 
new homes, jobs and community facilities. New 
development within and around town and local 
centres along the corridors, such as Downham 
District Centre and Southend Village, will help 
them to become more thriving and vibrant places.

17 LEWISHAM’S SOUTH AREA63817.9 Residents and visitors will benefit from excellent 
access to high quality parks, open and green 
spaces. Beckenham Place Park will continue to 
evolve as one of the Borough’s most important 
green spaces and a key visitor destination in 
south London. The river valley network will 
have greater prominence. Improvements to the 
environmental quality and amenity value of the 
Ravensbourne and Pool rivers will be realised 
through their re-naturalisation. Waterlink Way 
and the Pool River Linear Walk, along with the 
Green Chain Walk, will be enhanced to form key 
features of a network of walking routes and 
cycleways that link open and green spaces both 
within and outside of the Borough.

17 LEWISHAM’S SOUTH AREAKey spatial objectives 
Table
TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION OUR KEY SPATIAL OBJECTIVES (NOT LISTED IN ORDER OF PRIORITY) 
ARE TO:
1Secure the delivery the Bakerloo line extension and other infrastructure to significantly improve transport 
accessibility, address existing barriers to movement and unlock the area’s development potential.
2Coordinate new investment in the Bell Green and Lower Sydenham area to enable it to become a London Plan 
Opportunity Area in a future update to the London Plan.
3Deliver the regeneration of the former gasholders, Bell Green Retail Park and other sites nearby to create a 
new high quality residential-led mixed-use area, with a new Local Centre, that is well integrated with existing 
neighbourhoods and communities. Preserve and enhance the heritage value of the Livesey Memorial Hall and 
Gardens whilst creating a more positive relationship with the buildings and spaces surrounding them.
4Develop decentralised energy networks by taking advantage of opportunities presented by the redevelopment 
of larger sites around Bell Greenand Lower Sydenham.
5Create a high quality employment-led, mixed-used quarter through the renewal of industrial land at Stanton 
Way and Worsley Bridge Road.
6Transform the Ringway Corridor (Southend Lane and Whitefoot Lane) and the A21 Corridor (Bromley Road) by 
applying the Healthy Streets Approach, with public realm improvements that make walking, cycling and use of 
public transport safer and more convenient. Address severance caused by the Bell Green gyratory.
7Enhance the place qualities of the Ringway and A21 Corridors by integrating new high quality housing 
development and revitalising centres along them, particularly to secure the long term viability of Downham 
district centre.
8Reinstate and enhance the historic character and identity of Southend Village and its surrounds, building on the 
presence of local assets including the Green Man centre and Peter Pan pond, and through the redevelopment of 
the out-of-centre retail park opposite.
9Maintain the garden city and cottage estate character of residential areas in Bellingham and Downham whilst 
attracting inward investment and delivering new homes through their sensitive intensification. 
10Enhance the place qualities of Perry Rise (B227), Perry Hill (A212) and Alan Pegg Place by applying the Healthy 
Streets Approach, including by creating a safer and more coherent public realm at their convergence. Reinforce 
and enhance the character of established residential areas around Perry Hill and Perry Vale and deliver new 
homes through their sensitive intensification. 
11Support inclusive and mixed neighbourhoods and communities by effectively managing Houses in Multiple 
Occupation and preventing the harmful overconcentration of HMOs.
12Protect and enhance open and green spaces, including by expanding the role of Beckenham Place Park as a key 
visitor destination. Deliver the Lewisham Links, a connected network of high quality walking routes and cycle 
routesways link these spaces, taking advantage of the Green Chain Walk.
13Enhance the environmental quality and amenity value of the Ravensbourne and Pool Rivers. Improve public 
access to the rivers with new and improved routes and public realm enhancements, focussing on Waterlink Way 
and the Pool River Linear Park.

17 LEWISHAM’S SOUTH AREAFigure 17.2: South Area key diagram
642LSA1 South Area place principles
A Development proposals must contribute to the 
delivery of Good Growth with reference to Policy 
OL1 (Delivering an Open Lewisham) and in 
doing so, demonstrate how they have responded 
positively to and will support the achievement 
of the key spatial objectives for the South Area. 
B Development proposals within the South 
Area must demonstrate how they will help to 
tackle inequalities and the social, economic 
and environmental barriers that contribute to 
deprivation, in line with Policies LSA2 (Strategic 
Area for Regeneration) and LSA3 (Bell Green 
and Lower Sydenham).
C Development proposals must optimise the use 
of land taking into account the Bakerloo line 
extension and other infrastructure that will 
enable significant improvements to transport 
access in the South Area. The Council will seek 
that development is appropriately phased in 
order to ensure there is adequate infrastructure 
capacity in place, including transport and 
community infrastructure, to cope with 
the additional demands generated by new 
development, in line with other Local Plan 
policies.
D Development proposals must respond positively 
to distinctive and historic character of Southend 
Village and its surrounds. They should seek 
opportunities to enhance the unique place 
qualities, commercial and community functions 
of the Village, with reference to Policy LSA3 
(A21 Corridor / Bromley Road).
E Opportunities should be taken to direct new 
investment to the established residential 
neighbourhoods of Bellingham and Downham, including new high quality housing, provision 
of community infrastructure and public realm 
improvements. The sensitive intensification of 
these neighbourhoods will be supported where 
new development responds positively to their 
distinctive local and historic character. This 
includes the predominant garden city and cottage 
estate character associated with the London 
County Council estates. 
F Development proposals must respond positively to 
the role of Downham District Centre in supporting 
local neighbourhoods and communities, 
particularly for day-to-day shopping and service 
needs. A wide range of commercial, leisure, 
community and cultural uses will be supported 
within the centre in order to secure its long-term 
vitality and viability. Development proposals will 
be supported where they:
a. Retain or re-provide units suitable to 
accommodate main town centre uses, 
particularly for Class E retail uses; and
b. Are designed to enhance the quality of the 
streetscape, townscape, and environment, 
including through the improvements to 
shopfronts and the public realm.
G Bellingham is designated a Local Centre reflecting 
the role it plays in the provision of local shops, 
services and community facilities, along with its 
accessible location near Bellingham station and 
the A21 Corridor. To help secure the long-term 
vitality and viability of the centre, development 
proposals  must be designed to:
a. Improve access to and along the centre and 
station approach, including public realm 
enhancements that make walking routes and 
cycleways safer and more legible; 
643
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
17 LEWISHAM’S SOUTH AREAFigure 17.3: South Area connections
644b. Enhance the character of the area through 
townscape and streetscape improvements, 
including to shopfronts; and
c.  Facilitate the renewal of employment land 
at the southern end of Bromley Road SIL, 
particularly at the junction at Randlesdown 
Road.
H Development proposals must contribute to 
inclusive and mixed neighbourhoods and 
communities, including by protecting family 
housing and ensuring there is no harmful 
overconcentration of Houses in Multiple 
Occupation, with reference to Policy HO8 
(Housing with shared facilities).
I Development proposals must help to ensure 
the South Area benefits from a high quality 
network of walking routes and cycleways that 
connect neighbourhoods and places, including 
green spaces and waterways, with reference 
to Policy GR4 (Lewisham Links).  They should 
maximise opportunities to enhance or introduce 
new cycleways, particularly in the established 
residential areas with wider street layouts.
J Public realm and access improvements should be 
introduced along the A21 Corridor / Bromley Road 
(including active frontages uses along the edge of 
the Bromley Road retail park and the bus garage) 
and in Bellingham town centre (including active 
frontages and shopfront improvements to the 
parade of shops to the east of Bellingham station 
and on Randlesdown Road).
K The Council will work with Network Rail and 
other stakeholders to investigate the feasibility of 
delivering improvements to the bridge at Southend 
Lane to address issues of safety and movement within the area, including options for widening the 
bridge and increasing its height.
L The South Area’s network of green infrastructure, 
including open spaces, will be protected and 
enhanced, in line with other Local Plan policies. 
Investment at Beckenham Place Park will continue to 
be supported to ensure the park is maintained as a 
high quality open space of regional significance, and 
a key leisure and visitor destination in London and 
the wider southeast. Development proposals within 
the immediate vicinity of the park should provide for 
enhanced legibility, wayfinding and access to and 
from its entrances, and be designed having regard to 
the park’s landscape and historic setting. This includes 
consideration for the un-adopted walkway on Bromley 
Road and other links at the east side of the park. The 
Council will work with stakeholders to deliver flood 
alleviation measures at the park, in line with the River 
Corridor Improvement Plan SPD.
M The river valley network is a defining feature of 
the South Area which development proposals must 
respond positively to by:
a. Ensuring that development is designed to improve 
the ecological quality of the Ravensbourne and 
Pool rivers, including by naturalising the rivers, 
wherever opportunities arise; 
b. Ensuring the layout and design of development 
gives prominence to the rivers and the river valley, 
and enhances their amenity value, including by 
better revealing them; and
c. Facilitating the provision of new and enhanced 
connections to and along, and wherever possible 
across, the rivers and river valleys, including by 
improving the Waterlink Way and access to the Pool 
River Linear Park.

17 LEWISHAM’S SOUTH AREAFigure 17.4: Strategic area of regeneration
646LSA2 Strategic Area for Regeneration
A A Strategic Area for Regeneration is 
designated in the Local Plan. This covers 
the entirety of the South Area and parts of 
Grove Park neighbourhood in the East Area. 
A partnership approach will be pursued in 
order to ensure that new public and private 
sector investment is secured within this 
area, and that this investment is coordinated 
to successfully deliver regeneration in 
collaboration with local communities. 
B In order to tackle inequalities and the 
environmental, economic and social barriers 
that contribute to deprivation and the need 
for regeneration in this area, stakeholders 
and development proposals should seek 
opportunities to:
a. Significantly improve transport accessibility 
in the area, particularly by:
i. Enhancing provision of and access 
to high quality public transport 
infrastructure, including bus services; 
and
ii. Addressing barriers to movement by 
enhancing the network of walking 
routes and cycleways connecting to 
transport nodes, town and local centres, 
schools and training facilities, and 
employment locations.
b. Plan positively for social infrastructure to 
meet local needs, particularly community 
facilities and services catered to children 
and young people;
c. Support the vitality and viability of town 
and local centres, helping to ensure 
they make provision for a wide range of accessible shops and services;
d. Improve the environmental quality of 
neighbourhoods, including by reducing and 
mitigating air and noise pollution along 
main roads and junctions; and
e. Address deficiencies in access to open space 
by making provision for new and improved 
publicly accessible open space and 
improving links to green and open spaces.
C Investment to support the achievement of 
safe, healthy and liveable neighbourhoods 
within the Strategic Area for Regeneration 
should be facilitated through a variety of 
approaches, including:
a. Partnership working between key 
stakeholders to secure the delivery of new 
and improved infrastructure in Lewisham, 
including transport infrastructure such as 
the Bakerloo line extension, to significantly 
improve access to high quality services and 
community facilities, along with training 
and employment opportunities, whether 
within the Borough or elsewhere in London 
and beyond; 
b. The comprehensive redevelopment of site 
allocations, and renewal of town centres 
and employment locations, in the Bell Green 
and Lower Sydenham area, to help shift the 
focus and spread the benefits of investment 
southwards within the Borough; and
c. The sensitive intensification of sites 
and residential neighbourhoods, to 
support incremental but transformational 
improvement in the quality of housing and 
living environments.

17 LEWISHAM’S SOUTH AREALSA3 Bell Green and Lower Sydenham
A The designation of an Opportunity Area at Bell 
Green and Lower Sydenham in a future review of 
the London Plan will be strongly supported by 
the Council.
B To help realise the growth and regeneration 
potential of Bell Green and Lower Sydenham, 
and to ensure that new development within 
the area supports the delivery of the spatial 
strategy for the Borough, the Council intends to 
prepare a Supplementary Planning Document 
and/or Masterplan through consultation with 
the local community. This will complement the 
Local Plan in setting a long-term development 
and investment framework for the area.  
Development proposals must demonstrate how 
they have engaged positively with planning 
guidance endorsed or adopted by the Council.
C To ensure that regeneration in Bell Green and 
Lower Sydenham is delivered in a coordinated  
manner, development proposals must:
a. Ensure that development will not 
prejudice the delivery of the Bakerloo 
line extension , taking into account any 
Ministerial Safeguarding Directions and 
Mayor of London / Transport for London 
infrastructure requirements and/or 
feasibility studies associated with BLE Phase 
2, with reference to Policy TR2 (Bakerloo 
line extension);
b. Optimise the capacity of sites having regard 
to future improvements in Public Transport 
Access Levels enabled by the BLE and other 
transport infrastructure;c. Deliver the comprehensive redevelopment 
of the former Bell Green gas holders, Bell 
Green Retail Park and Sainsbury’s Bell 
Green, and through this process make 
provision for a residential-led mixed-use 
quarter with a distinctive urban character 
that is supported by a new Local Centre, 
the scale of which is informed by a Retail 
Impact Assessment;
d. Protect the employment function of the 
LSIS at Stanton Square and Worsley Bridge 
Road, whilst exploring opportunities 
to deliver new high quality workspace, 
including through the co-location of 
employment and other compatible uses;
e. Deliver public realm improvements to help 
reduce car use and barriers to movement, 
improve permeability and enhance the 
walking and cycle environment, particularly 
around the Bell Green gyratory and along 
major roads, including the A212 (Sydenham 
Road, Bell Green Lane, Perry Hill), A2218 
(Stanton Way, Southend Lane) and Worsley 
Bridge Road; 
f. Enable the reconfiguration, re-routing and/
or redesign of roads where this is necessary 
to support the area masterplan;  and
g. Ensure adequate provision of infrastructure, 
including community facilities, taking into 
account existing need and any additional 
demand arising from new development.
648D Development proposals should contribute to 
enhancing the place qualities of Bell Green and 
Lower Sydenham, including by:
a. Ensuring that the layout and design of 
development improves permeability and 
circulation within the local area, and 
promotes the area’s integration with 
surrounding neighbourhoods and places. 
This includes enhanced walking routes and 
cycleways to Sydenham town centre and 
new connections to Bellingham, over the 
Pool River where feasible;
b. Integrating new publicly accessible open space 
into development;
c. Responding positively to heritage assets and 
their setting, including the Livesey Hall War 
Memorial and gardens; and
d. Maximising opportunities to improve the 
ecological quality and amenity value of the 
river environment, including by enhancing 
access to Riverview Walk and Pool River Linear 
Park, and securing views to the Pool River.

17 LEWISHAM’S SOUTH AREA650LSA4 A21 corridor / Bromley Road
A The transformation of the A21 Corridor 
(Bromley Road) and its immediate surrounds 
into a network of liveable, healthy 
neighbourhoods with a distinctive urban 
character is integral to the delivery of the 
spatial strategy. Development proposals 
must demonstrate how they have responded 
positively to the A21 Development Framework 
through the design-led approach.
B Development proposals along the A21 Corridor 
and its immediate surrounds must contribute 
to enhancing the place qualities of the Corridor 
by:
a. Responding positively to the evolving urban 
character of the area through the sensitive 
intensification of sites,  where appropriate;
b. Helping to establish a distinctive and legible 
urban grain along and around the Corridor, 
including clusters of development of an 
urban scale situated at major road junctions, 
particularly at Southend Lane;
c. Ensuring new development reinforces or 
creates a positive relationship with the public 
realm, including through the provision of 
positive frontages along the Corridor, and 
active ground floor frontages incorporating 
commercial and community uses, where 
appropriate, including at Southend Village 
and Downham District Centre; 
d. Maximising opportunities to integrate urban 
greening measures; and
e. Enhancing connections between 
neighbourhoods along and surrounding the 
Corridor through the delivery of new and 
improved public realm.C Development proposals must respond positively 
to the distinctive and historic character of 
Southend Village and its surrounds, whilst 
supporting the long term viability and vitality of 
the shopping parade by:
a. Enhancing the place qualities of the Village 
by designing development to create a more 
coherent urban grain along Bromley Road;
b. Making provision for a complementary mix of 
main town uses within the parade,; and
c. Improving visitor access to Southend Village  
through public realm enhancements: 
i. Around the junctions at Beckenham Hill 
Road and Southend Lane/Whitefood 
Lane;
ii. To and along Coninsborough Crescent; and
iii. At the route connecting Whitefoot Lane 
with Beechborough Green and Gardens.
D Development proposals must reinforce and 
enhance the role of the A21 as a strategic 
movement corridor by applying the Healthy 
Streets Approach. This principal north-south 
route should be supported by a complementary 
network of legible, safe and accessible walking 
routes and cycleways that link with it to 
enhance connections between neighbourhoods 
and places, including open spaces such as 
Beckenham Place Park, Forster Park, and 
Downham Fields.  
E Development proposals should investigate 
and maximise opportunities to reinstate or 
enhance the network of finer grain east-west 
connections for walking and cycling to and 
from the A21 Corridor, and the river valley, 
particularly where sites are to be delivered 
through comprehensive redevelopment.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
17 LEWISHAM’S SOUTH AREA17.10 Lewisham’s South Area will play an important 
role in helping to deliver inclusive, healthy and 
liveable neighbourhoods in the Borough. It 
has the potential to accommodate a significant 
amount of growth over the plan period. However, 
the level of this growth will be contingent 
on the delivery of infrastructure necessary to 
support both new developments and existing 
neighbourhoods. This includes transport 
infrastructure and particularly the Bakerloo line 
extension. The South Area does not benefit 
from the same Public Transport Access Levels as 
many other parts of the Borough. This is one of 
the key factors contributing to inequality and 
the levels of deprivation experienced locally, 
and the need to designate a Strategic Area for 
Regeneration. Targeted interventions are required 
to tackle inequalities and the social, economic 
and environmental barriers that contribute to 
deprivation. The Local Plan sets out a strategy 
to ensure that growth and regeneration in the 
South Area is effectively coordinated, with a 
clear framework in place to facilitate the delivery 
of the Bakerloo line extension and maximise 
opportunities associated with it.  This will require 
that stakeholders work together and alongside 
local communities to tackle deprivation by 
directing investment in a joined up way. The 
phasing of new development on larger site 
allocations will be critical to delivering area 
improvements and transformational change for 
the benefit of everyone. 
17.11 The Bell Green and Lower Sydenham area 
is poised to become one of London’s next 
Opportunity Areas, and the Council will support 
this designation in a future review of the London 
Plan. There are a number of large sites in 
proximity to one another with the potential to be Lewisham’s South Area
comprehensively redeveloped. They include the 
former Bell Green Gas Holders, an out-of-centre 
retail park and buildings, and several designated 
employment locations. The Local Plan establishes 
the principles for their regeneration and renewal. 
The Council intends to prepare a more detailed 
framework to ensure coordination between 
landowners in the delivery of a new high quality, 
residential-led mixed-use neighbourhood, 
which will be informed by consultation with 
local communities and other key stakeholders. 
Development proposals will need to address 
the area’s relationship with and connections to 
Sydenham District Centre. 
17.12 A new Local Centre in the Bell Green and Lower 
Sydenham area will be enabled through the 
comprehensive redevelopment of the existing 
out-of-centre retail park and the reconfiguration 
of commercial uses.  A preliminary assessment 
has considered the potential impacts on existing 
town centres, such as trade diversion, that might 
result from the introduction of a new centre 
at this location.  It suggests a Local Centre is 
appropriate in terms of function and scale, and 
should principally serve demands generated 
by new development. Planning applications 
may be required to include a Retail Impact 
Assessment to ensure there will be no adverse 
impact on the vitality and viability of existing 
centres. The boundaries and frontages of the 
new Local Centre will be established through 
the development management process and 
formalised through a Local Plan review.
65217.13 The South Area derives much of its character 
from the interwar homes constructed by 
the London County Council, particularly 
in Bellingham and Downham. The housing 
estates were influenced by ‘garden city’ 
principles and provide for a distinctive but 
relatively homogenous pattern of lower density 
development. These neighbourhoods experience 
some of the highest levels of deprivation in 
Lewisham. Many localities are within the 20 
per cent most deprived in the country. Given 
the character of the established residential 
neighbourhoods and the scarcity of large sites 
suitable for redevelopment, a more tailored 
approach to investment is required to address 
inequalities and the causes of deprivation. Area 
improvements will be generated mainly through 
the sensitive intensification of established 
neighbourhoods and collaborative working 
between stakeholders to deliver new and 
improved infrastructure.  
17.14 The Local Plan seeks to deliver a well-integrated 
network of high quality walking routes and 
cycleways that link to public transport nodes 
and other key destinations. The main aim is 
to encourage and enable modal shift and to 
significantly reduce journeys made by car. This 
will be supported through the transformation 
of the A21 (Bromley Road) and Southend Lane 
using the Healthy Streets Approach. These 
principal movement corridors within the South 
Area which have the potential to accommodating 
growth, and where new development can 
deliver public realm enhancements to improve 
connections between neighbourhoods and 
places. Focussed investment will also help to 
support the vitality and viability of centres along 
or in proximity to the routes, including Downham District Centre, Southend Village and Bellingham 
Local Centre. Regeneration of Bell Green and 
Lower Sydenham presents opportunities to 
improve the environment for walking and cycling, 
particularly at major road junctions, including at 
Southend Lane.
17.15 The South Area’s network of green infrastructure 
includes parks, open spaces and waterways. 
Beckenham Place Park is the Borough’s largest 
green space, featuring much ancient woodland, 
and is an important local asset. A significant 
amount of investment has been delivered here in 
recent years and the park will play an increasingly 
important role as a local and wider regional 
visitor destination. The river valley network is 
also a defining feature of the area, with the 
Ravensbourne and Pool Rivers traversing it. 
Opportunities must be taken to re-naturalise 
the rivers wherever possible in order to improve 
their ecological and amenity value. The Lewisham 
Links are centred on the network of green 
infrastructure, recognising the priority given to 
improving public access to it by walking and 
cycling. The Council will work with other local 
authorities, including Bromley, to investigate 
opportunities to improve connections from the 
South Area to green spaces outside of Lewisham.

17.16 Comprehensive mixed-use redevelopment 
with compatible residential, commercial main 
town centre and community uses. Refurbished 
community facilities in heritage assets at 
Livesey Memorial Hall site. Public realm and 
environmental enhancements, including new 
walking and cycle routes, and public open space.
Opportunities
17.17 The site comprises a former gas works that 
formed a significant landmark in the local 
area and the site of the Livesey Memorial 
Hall and grounds. The site is largely vacant, 
with the gasholders having been dismantled, 
but community uses continue in the Livesey 
Memorial Hall and grounds. Redevelopment and 
site intensification, along with the introduction 
of a range of uses, will bring the land back into 
active use and support local area regeneration. 
There is scope to facilitate transformational 
public realm and environmental enhancements in 
coordination with other sites, and in accordance 
with an area framework for Bell Green and Lower 
Sydenham. Development requirements
1. Landowners must work in partnership and  in 
accordance with a master plan for  the wider Bell 
Green and Lower Sydenham area and including 
a site masterplan, to ensure appropriate co-
location, phasing and balance of uses across the 
site, in line with Policy DM3 (Masterplans and 
comprehensive development). 2. The site must be fully re-integrated with the 
surrounding street network, including Perry 
Hill to the west, Alan Pegg Place to the south 
and forthcoming development to the east,to 
improve access and permeability in the local area, 
with enhanced walking and cycle connections 
between public spaces and the site’s surrounding 
neighbourhoods. This will require a hierarchy 
of routes with clearly articulated east-west and 
north-south corridors.
3. Delivery of new and improved public realm and 
open space, in accordance with a site-wide 
public realm strategy that takes account of, 
and provides links to, the nearby SINC to the 
north of the site, and is of beneficial use for 
local residents without impacting on the on-site 
heritage assets.
4. Positive frontage on Alan Pegg Place and onto 
the South West Corner at the junction of Alan 
Pegg Place and Perry Hill..
5. Safeguard land to support delivery of strategic 
transport infrastructure, including where required 
for the Bakerloo line extension
6. Development must be sensitive to the setting 
of the listed Livesey Memorial Hall and its 
curtilage open spaces and structures, and the 
listed boundary wall and War Memorial, and 
should incorporate it into the wider townscape 
by creating a positive relationship with new 
development
7. The history and heritage of the South Suburban 
Gas Works site should be revealed through a 
site wide interpretation strategy including the 
heritage assets and their curtilage, re-use of the 
retained elements of the gasholder structures, 
and through hard and soft landscaping, 
architecture, public art and street/place naming.     
657
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
17 LEWISHAM’S SOUTH AREA17.18 Development guidelines
1. Development should deliver a more cohesive 
street pattern, in coordination with other 
neighbouring site allocations.  There is an 
opportunity to open up new walking and cycle 
links to the east and south of the site, to create 
a legible and more permeable network of routes 
that connect to the surrounding neighbourhood 
areas. 
2. To achieve the optimal capacity of the site, 
development proposals should take into account 
future public transport accessibility levels, as 
associated with the Bakerloo Line extension. 
3. Applicants should consider increasing bus 
services through the site, in partnership with TFL.
4. Development should be designed to provide 
an appropriate transition in bulk, scale and 
massing through the site and from the site to its 
surrounds, which are predominantly suburban in 
character to the north and west. Tall buildings 
will not be appropriate in the western part of the 
site where maintaining the setting of the heritage 
assets should be prioritised.  Tall buildings may 
be considered along the site’s eastern boundary, 
where they can be designed so as to contribute 
positively to the streetscene and without 
detriment to the heritage assets on site.
5. Development must retain the listed structures 
at the west of the site and incorporate them 
sensitively into the redevelopment of the 
remainder of the site in a way that enhances 
their setting and improves access to the Livesey 
Memorial Hall. The hall should continue to be 
a focal point within the design of the site and 
be used as a community asset. Public realm and 
open space should form an integral part of the 
design of the site, ensuring that the open spaces 
in the curtilage of the Lively Memorial Hall to the north (bowling green) and south (tennis courts) 
are retained as open space, ancillary to the use 
of the hall.  Public access through and from the 
site to the nearby Waterlink Way and SINC should 
also be integral to the site’s layout and design.     
6. The site is constrained by existing utilities 
restrictions, easements; a Hazardous Substances 
Consent; a former gas holder and significant 
service infrastructure that supported its former 
use, including a gas mains and gas ‘governor’ 
and a bentonite wall. Ground surveys will need 
to identify the nature and extent of ground 
contamination and environmental pollution, 
with remedial works and/or mitigation measures 
implemented, where necessary, in partnership 
with utility providers. The Council recognises 
the challenges associated with significant 
decontamination and remediation of the site.
7. Development proposals should investigate 
opportunities to deliver a decentralised energy 
network.
8. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable and ensure infrastructure upgrades 
are delivered ahead of the site being occupied 
through a housing phasing plan. New 
connections into the trunk sewers will not be 
allowed.

site masterplan, to ensure the appropriate co-
location, phasing and balance of uses across 
the site, in lin with DM3 (Masterplans and 
comprehensive development). 
2. The site must be fully re-integrated with 
the surrounding street network to improve 
access and permeability in the local area, 
with enhanced walking and cycle connections 
between public spaces and the site’s surrounding 
neighbourhoods. This will require a hierarchy 
of routes with clearly articulated east-west and 
north-south corridors.
3. Delivery of new and improved public realm and 
open space, in accordance with a site-wide public 
realm strategy, including enhanced public access 
to Waterlink Way.
4. Safeguard land to support delivery of strategic 
transport infrastructure, including where required 
for the Bakerloo line extension and consider 
options for the provision of a new railway 
station across the Bell Green Masterplan area, in 
partnership with TFL and Network Rail. 5. 
Development proposals must protect and seek 
to enhance green infrastructure, including SINC, 
green corridor, Metropolitan Open Land and the 
Pool River, taking into account the River Corridor 
Improvement Plan SPD.
66017.22 Development guidelines
1. Development should deliver a more cohesive 
and rational road network and street pattern, in 
coordination with other site allocations. There is 
an opportunity to open up new east-west and 
north-south walking and cycle links, to create a 
legible and more permeable network of routes 
that connect to the surrounding neighbourhood 
areas. 
2. Public access through and from the site to 
the nearby Waterlink Way and SINC should be 
integral to the site’s layout and design.     
3. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable and ensure infrastructure upgrades 
are delivered ahead of the site being occupied 
through a housing phasing plan. Given the 
adjacent watercourse, surface water should 
not be discharged to the public network.  New 
connections into trunk sewers will not be 
allowed.
4. To achieve the optimal capacity of the site, 
development proposals should take into account 
future public transport accessibility levels, as 
associated with the Bakerloo line extension. 
5. Applicants should consider increasing bus 
services through the site, in partnership with TFL. 
6. Development should be designed to provide an 
appropriate transition in bulk, scale and massing 
from the site to its surrounds. Neighbourhoods 
to the immediate north and east of the site 
are predominantly suburban and residential in 
character.7. The site is identified as a suitable location for 
tall buildings, in line with Policy QD4 (Building 
heights).  
8. Parking provision should reflect future 
improvements to public transport accessibility 
levels in the area.
9. Development should support the Area of Special 
Local Character by conserving and enhancing 
the characteristics that contribute to the area’s 
significance.
10. Development proposals should investigate 
opportunities to deliver a decentralised energy 
network.
11. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Sothern Gas Networks and Fulcrum Pipelines Ltd 
and engage with them early at pre-application 
stage, to investigate existing gas infrastructure 
and the need for gas supply within the new 
development.

redevelopment with compatible main town 
centre, commercial and community uses. 
Reconfiguration of existing buildings to facilitate 
a new layout with new and improved routes, both 
into and through the site, along with public realm 
and environmental enhancements.
Opportunities
17.50 The site comprises large format out-of-centre 
retail buildings and associated car parking. 
Redevelopment and site intensification, along 
with the introduction of a wider range of uses, 
will provide a more optimal use of land. The 
site benefits from relatively good levels of 
transport accessibility, and being situated on 
the A21 corridor offers scope for public realm 
improvements to support movement by walking 
and cycling. Development will also help to 
enhance the amenity and character of the historic 
Southend Village, which is situated opposite the 
site.
17.51 Development requirements
1. Development proposals must be delivered 
in accordance with the A21 Development 
Framework and consider co-location, phasing 
and balance of uses across the site, in line with 
Policy DM3 (masterplans and comprehensive 
development) Longer term redevelopment of the 
site should not prejudice the continued operation 
of the site’s retail uses in the short to medium 
term.
2. Positive frontages along Bromley Road and 
Beckenham Hill.3. The site must be fully re-integrated with the 
surrounding street network to improve access 
and permeability in the local area, with enhanced 
walking and cycle connections between public 
spaces, the site’s surrounding neighbourhoods 
and Southend Village. This will require a hierarchy 
of routes with clearly articulated east-west and 
north-south corridors. 
4. Delivery of new and improved public realm and 
open space, in accordance with a site-wide public 
realm strategy, including retention of the pond. 
5. Development proposals must protect and seek 
to enhance green infrastructure, including SINC, 
urban green space and public open space.
17.52 Development guidelines
1. Re-provision of the existing retail use is 
acceptable, providing other objectives for 
redeveloping the site (such as improved layout, 
walking, cycling, landscaping and alternative use 
of the surface car park) can be achieved. 
2. Development should be designed to enhance 
walking and cycle movement, with improved 
permeability through the site, in particular from 
Bromley Road through to Beckenham Hill Road 
and from Bromley Road through to the sports 
ground to the west of the site.
3. Development should improve opportunities for 
walking, cycling and other active travel modes, 
contributing to the A21 Healthy Streets Corridor. 
4. Landscaping design should optimise linkages to 
and opportunities associated with the many green 
features within and surrounding the site. The pond 
(designated SINC) in the eastern corner of the 
site, should form a key feature of the development 
and its biodiversity value should be enhanced. 
Proposals will also be expected to retain the 
existing mature tree coverage, whilst improving 
the amenity of the remainder of the site.

John the Baptist Church, and their setting.  
6. Development should create a positive 
relationship with the sports ground, which 
adjoins the site at its western boundary.
7. Development proposals should make a more 
optimal use of the land by reviewing options for 
the existing car park.  
8. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
minimise impacts on groundwater, manage 
surface water, divert existing sewers where 
applicable and ensure infrastructure upgrades 
are delivered ahead of the site being occupied

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVEContext and character
18.1 The West Area comprises the neighbourhoods of 
Telegraph Hill, Brockley, Ladywell, Crofton Park, 
Honor Oak, Blythe Hill, Forest Hill, Sydenham, 
and Sydenham Hill. These neighbourhoods have 
a distinctive character which is derived their 
historical development as a series of villages that 
formed around railway stations. 
18.2 The area is characterised by its topography with 
open spaces at high ground providing views 
towards London and Kent, as well as prominent 
green spaces with remnants of the Great North 
Wood. The area remains noticeably wooded, 
with prominent mature street and garden trees. 
The railway line dissects the area and limits 
movement between many neighbourhoods. 
However, the sidings and embankments also 
support a significant variety of biodiversity 
and wildlife, which reinforce the area’s green 
character. The Ravensbourne River and river 
valley corridor provide an important natural 
corridor through the area. Whilst there are many 
parks and open spaces the number and quality of 
walking and cycle links between these are varied, 
and many open spaces are poorly connected.  
18.3 The residential areas are predominantly low-rise 
with linear terraces and narrow street sections 
resulting in relatively high densities. The West 
Area has a diverse built character that includes 
historic Victorian and Edwardian terraces, 
interwar ‘garden city’ inspired housing, post-
war flats and Council estates, and 20th century 
infill. There  are a number Conservation Areas 
and listed buildings, which strongly inform the 
character of the area.   18.4 The West Area contains the District Centres 
of Sydenham and Forest Hill that have a 
diverse town centre offer and serve their wider 
neighbourhoods.  There are also a number of 
complementary Local Centres and parades 
catering to the day-to-day needs of residents 
and visitors. Some of the area’s town centres 
contain a number of vacant buildings and 
underused sites, and have a poorer quality public 
realm. The area has a diverse land use mix, with 
a strong creative and digital industry clusters in 
Brockley and Forest Hill with links to Goldsmiths 
College and Lewisham College. The West Area 
contains the Horniman Museum which is a 
significant cultural destination within London and 
the southeast.
18.5 Ther West Area has a number of train stations 
and transport corridors, including the B218 
Brockley Road/Brockley Rise and the A205 
South Circular. The public realm is generally of 
a poorer quality along these roads and they are 
also dominated by vehicles, inhibiting movement 
by walking and cycling. Whilst many train stations 
are well positioned and in accessible locations, a 
number of stations have a poor sense of arrival 
and are not well-sited within the neighbourhood 
they serve.
692Vision
18.6 By 2040 the historic fabric, landscape and 
woodland character of the West Area will be 
reinforced so that its neighbourhoods and 
centres retain their village qualities, including 
valued views towards London and Kent. The 
area will feature a distinctive, thriving and well-
connected network of town and Local Centres 
that complement one another. The character and 
role of the main routes along which centres and 
train stations are located, including Brockley Rise 
/ Brockley Road (B218), will be re-examined to 
enhance links between them. The delivery of the 
Brockley station interchange and other transport 
improvements will enhance access to central 
London, opening opportunities for everyone to 
benefit from.
18.7 The revitalisation of the area’s District and Local 
Centres will ensure they remain thriving hubs of 
community and commercial activity, as well as 
focal points for new housing, including a high 
proportion of genuinely affordable housing. 
Public realm enhancements at the main entrances 
to the centres, as well as at their stations and 
approaches, will make them more accessible and 
inviting places. Forest Hill District Centre will 
evolve as a key employment location and lively 
Cultural Quarter, building on the presence of the 
Horniman Museum and Gardens and studios at 
Havelock Walk. New workspace will be delivered 
through the renewal of industrial sites within and 
around the centres, particularly at Forest Hill and 
Kirkdale. The B218 and South Circular (A205) 
will be transformed using the Healthy Streets 
Approach, with public realm enhancements that make walking, cycling and the use of public 
transport safer and more convenient. Elsewhere, 
the character of established residential areas will 
be reinforced, with their sensitive intensification 
providing for improvements throughout the wider 
area.
18.8 Residents and visitors will benefit from excellent 
access to high quality parks, open and green 
spaces. Many of these spaces will feature 
extensive views across Lewisham as well as 
natural woodland, the remnants of the Great 
North Wood. The river valley will have greater 
prominence with the River Ravensbourne better 
revealed around Ladywell. A connected network 
of high quality walking routes and cycleways 
will link open and green spaces both within and 
outside of the Borough.

18 LEWISHAM’S WEST AREA694Key spatial objectives 
TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION OUR KEY SPATIAL OBJECTIVES (NOT LISTED IN ORDER OF PRIORITY) 
ARE TO:
1Secure the delivery of the Brockley station interchange to improve transport access and help ensure growth is 
appropriately supported by infrastructure.
2Secure the long-term vitality and viability of the area’s network of District and Local centres, and enhance 
walking and cycling connections between them. Ensure the centres retain their distinctive character and 
complement each other with a unique offer of shops, services and facilities.
3Reinforce the role of Sydenham District Centre in supporting the neighbourhood. Deliver public realm 
improvements at key arrival points to make the centre a more accessible and welcoming place. Support new high 
quality development, including mixed-use development, on sites which detract from the distinctive character of 
the centre.
4Strengthen and expand the role of Forest Hill District Centre as hub of community, commercial and cultural 
activity and a key employment location. Establish a new Cultural Quarter in the area, building on the presence 
of the Horniman Museum and Gardens and the cluster of creative industries at Havelock Walk and 118 Stansted 
Road.

696LWA1 West Area place principles
A Development proposals must contribute to 
the delivery of Good Growth with reference 
to Policy OL1 (Delivering an Open Lewisham) 
and in doing so, demonstrate how they have 
responded positively to and will support the 
achievement of the key spatial objectives for 
the West Area.
a. The redevelopment of strategic sites, and 
the renewal of other sites, within and 
around the area’s linear network of town 
centres is facilitated to better connect 
the centres and to secure their long-term 
vitality and viability; in line with Policy 
LWA2 (Connected network of centres);
b. New development within and around 
Forest Hill district town centre supports 
and reinforces the centre’s role as a key 
commercial, community and cultural hub, 
in line with Policy LWA3 (Forest Hill district 
centre and surrounds);
c. New development is directed to the main 
corridors of Brockley Road (B218) and 
Stanstead Road (A205 / South Circular), 
including for high quality housing, 
workspace, town centre and community 
uses, along with supporting infrastructure;
d. New employment development is 
concentrated within town centres and 
the Locally Significant Industrial Sites at 
Endwell Road, Malham Road, Perry Vale, 
Clyde Vale and Willow Way;e. Opportunities are taken to deliver new 
and improved workspace through the 
intensification of sites and renewal of 
industrial land, including through the 
co-location of employment and other 
compatible uses on selected LSIS, along 
with improving the environmental quality of 
employment locations;
f. The Forest Hill Cultural Quarter plays an 
integral and expanded role in supporting 
the cultural and creative industries; and
g. Land is safeguarded to secure the delivery 
of strategic transport infrastructure, 
including Brockley Station and Interchange, 
in line with Policy. TR1 (Sustainable 
transport and movement).
B Development proposals must respond 
positively to the character and heritage 
value of established residential areas. This 
includes the historic character of the area’s 
neighbourhoods, and particularly their town 
centres which are defined by their Victorian 
shopping parades and make an important 
contribution to local distinctiveness. The 
historic landscape character, including 
woodland and topography, is also a defining 
feature of the West Area, which was 
once covered by the Great North Wood. 
Development proposals must maximise 
opportunities to integrate urban greening 
measures to respond to and connect the 
remnants of the woodland, along with 
protecting and enhancing important views and 
vistas.

18 LEWISHAM’S WEST AREAFigure 18.3: West Area connections
698C Development proposals incorporating new or 
re-purposed workspace should seek to ensure 
that this provision is designed to accommodate 
micro, small and medium-sized businesses, to 
complement and support existing clusters of 
cultural and creative industries, including in 
Brockley and Forest Hill. 
D The comprehensive redevelopment of sites 
within Willow Way LSIS will be supported 
where this retains and enhances industrial 
capacity and local employment provision, 
as well as improves the quality of the 
environment and townscape. Development 
proposals within the LSIS must ensure the 
design provides for a positive relationship 
with Kirkdale Local Centre, particularly to 
ensure the protection of amenity as well as 
to maximise opportunities to create safe and 
legible routes between and around the LSIS 
and the Local Centre. Development proposals 
must deliver high quality designs that help to 
establish a more cohesive, employment-led 
mixed-use quarter.
E The sensitive intensification of established 
residential neighbourhoods will be supported 
where new development responds positively 
to their distinctive local and historic character, 
including the landscape setting. Development 
proposals must have regard to the Small Sites 
SPD, where appropriate.
F Development proposals must help to ensure 
the West Area benefits from a high quality 
network of walking routes and cycleways that 
connect neighbourhoods and places including 
green spaces and waterways, with reference to Policy GR4 (Lewisham Links). Consideration 
should be given to improving connections 
between parks and open spaces that are 
located outside of the Borough, but which are 
within comfortable walking or cycling distance 
from the West area.  
G Development proposals must respond 
positively to the historic character and setting 
of the Horniman Museum and Gardens, 
particularly to support its role as a key visitor 
destination within London and the southeast. 
Development proposals within the vicinity of 
the museum should provide for public realm 
enhancements to improve way finding and 
access to and from the museum. 
H Development proposals must contribute 
to delivery of high quality public realm 
using the Healthy Streets Approach. 
Particular consideration should be given to 
enhancements at station entrances and around 
their approaches and along key movement 
corridors including Ladywell Road, South 
Circular (A205), Sydenham Road, Dartmouth 
Road, Brockley Road/Brockley Rise, and 
Drakefell Road/Gellatly Road.Development 
proposals should to contribute to delivery of 
high quality public realm, particularly on and 
around approaches to and from train stations, 
and along key movement routes including 
Ladywell Road, the South Circular, Sydenham

18 LEWISHAM’S WEST AREALWA2 Connected network of town centres
A The West Area contains an historic network of 
town centres that serve its neighbourhoods 
and communities. Development proposals 
must respond positively to this network and 
help to secure the long-term vitality and 
viability of the centres by:
a. Preserving and enhancing their distinctive 
and historic character, including townscape, 
building and shopfront features;
b. Making provision for a wide range of 
appropriate main town centre uses that 
build on the economic strengths and unique 
attributes of each of the centres, whilst 
seeking to ensure they complement and do 
not compete with one another; and
c. Improving connections between the centres

key public transport nodes, including 
stations.
B Brockley Cross, Crofton Park, Honor Oak / 
Brockley Rise and Kirkdale and Ladywell are 
designated as Local Centres reflecting the 
complementary role each plays in the provision 
of local services and community facilities 
within their neighbourhoods.
C Within the West Area’s town and local centres, 
development proposals for meanwhile uses on 
vacant sites and properties will be supported 
in order to facilitate their return to active use, in line with Policy DM5 (Meanwhile uses). 
Meanwhile uses of spaces catered for micro 
businesses, including independent traders, and 
community uses will be strongly encouraged.
D Development proposals should support the 
growth and evolution of Forest Hill district 
centre and its surrounds as a key hub of creative, 
cultural and community activity, in line with 
Policy LWA2 (Forest hill district centre and 
surrounds).
E The renewal of Sydenham District Centre 
will be supported in order to secure its long-
term vitality and viability. Development 
proposals should contribute to the renewal and 
revitalisation of the town centre by:

and fabric of the centre through the 
sensitive redevelopment and infilling of sites, 
particularly those which detract from the 
historic character and urban grain that is still 
evident; 
b. Delivering public realm improvements to make 
the centre a more accessible, welcoming and 
attractive place to visit, particularly at key 
arrival points around Sydenham station and at 
the western and eastern edges of the centre, 
along Kirkdale and Sydenham Road; and
c. Making provision for a diverse mix of main 
town centre uses (including shops, services 
and community facilities) that reinforce the 
role of the centre in Lewisham’s town centre 
hierarchy, and ensure it both supports and 
complements significant new development 
planned in the Bell Green and Lower 
Sydenham area.
700F The renewal of Kirkdale Local Centre will be 
supported in order to secure its long-term 
vitality and viability. Development proposals 
must contribute to area improvements through 
high quality designs that help to create a more 
cohesive and positive relationship between 
the centre and neighbouring properties and 
sites, including the Willow Way LSIS and 
redeveloped former Sydenham police station.  
G The continued renewal of Brockley Cross Local 
Centre will be supported in order to secure its 
long-term vitality and viability. Development 
proposals must contribute to the renewal and 
revitalisation of the centre by:
a. Reinforcing its distinctive character, 
particularly by maintaining a diverse mix of 
uses and responding positively to its historic 
character; 
b. Seeking opportunities to support and make 
provision of workspace for the cultural and 
creative industries,  building on the existing 
cluster of activities to complement and 
strengthen relationships with the Forest 
Hill Cultural Quarter and Lewisham Creative 
Enterprise Zone; and
c. Delivering public realm improvements at 
the western approach to Brockley station to 
improve access and sense of arrival.
H Development proposals should help to secure 
the long-term vitality and viability of the Local 
Centres at Crofton Park, Ladywell, and Honor 
Oak/Brockley Rise by:
a. Reinforcing their distinctive and historic 
character, particularly by maintaining a diverse mix of main town centre uses and 
improving shopfronts;
b. Delivering public realm enhancements to 
improve access and sense of arrival to and 
around train stations located in proximity to 
the centres; and
c. Seeking to alleviate vehicle congestion 
by improving the walking and cycle 
environment.

18 LEWISHAM’S WEST AREA702LWA3 Forest Hill district centre and surrounds
A Development proposals must support the long-
term vitality and viability of Forest Hill District 
Centre by enhancing the townscape and other 
place qualities of the centre and its surrounds, as 
well as reinforcing its role as a key focal point for 
commercial, cultural and community activity. They 
must demonstrate how they will contribute to a 
coordinated process of town centre improvement 
that responds positively to the area’s distinctive 
character. They must also deliver a complementary 
mix of main town centre uses, along with new 
housing, whilst ensuring that the centre’s 
predominant commercial, cultural and community 
role is maintained and enhanced.
B The growth and evolution of Forest Hill District 
Centre and its surrounds as a key hub of creative, 
cultural and community activity will be supported 
and reinforced by:
a. Designating the Forest Hill Cultural Quarter 
along with promoting and seeking to protect 
cultural and creative uses and activities within it, 
in line with Policy EC18 (Culture and the night-
time economy); 
b. Designating the town centre as an area of local 
significance of night-time economic activity, and 
strengthening its role as a visitor destination, in 
line with Policy EC18 (Culture and the night time 
economy);
c. Promoting Havelock Walk as an important 
asset with the Cultural Quarter and ensuring 
development proposals within this location:
i. Respond positively to its distinctive character 
and employment function;
ii. Do not result in a net loss of workspace 
(including workspace associated with 
authorised live-work development); and
iii. Clearly demonstrate that proposals for live-work development will secure dedicated 
provision of workspace that is appropriate to the 
location;
d. Extending the boundary of the Malham Road 
LSIS to include 118 Stansted Road, along with 
protecting and enhancing uses within the LSIS 
that make a positive contribution to the Cultural 
Quarter; and
e. Promoting and protecting the Horniman Museum 
and Gardens as a significant cultural asset, along 
with securing public realm enhancements that 
improve wayfinding and safe access to it.
C Development proposals must contribute to enhancing 
the public realm in order to promote and enable 
walking and cycling within and around the centre, 
as well as to make it a significantly more accessible, 
safer, healthier and attractive place.  Particular 
consideration will need to be given to movements 
along and across:
a. The main junction and major roads, including the 
South Circular (A205), Dartmouth Road (A2216), 
Clyde Vale, Perry Vale and Waldram Park Road; and
b. Station approaches and forecourts. 
D Development proposals  designed to improve the 
quality of the station underpass (including its 
visibility, legibility and safe use) will be strongly 
supported. 
E Development proposals must respond positively to 
the evolving urban character of the town centre and 
its immediate surrounds. They must be designed to 
provide for an appropriate transition in scale, bulk, 
mass,  height and character between the commercial 
core of the centre, its edges and surrounding 
residential neighbourhoods, taking into account 
the area’s distinctive townscape, landscape and 
topography features.

18 LEWISHAM’S WEST AREALewisham’s West Area
18.9 Lewisham’s West Area is characterised by the 
remnants of the Great North Wood along 
with its development as a series of historic 
villages on a north-south spine which have 
grown around railway stations. The West 
Area will play a more complementary role in 
accommodating the Borough’s future growth. 
This is owing to its expansive historic and natural 
environments along with the scarcity of large 
development sites. Together these factors limit 
opportunities for bringing forward substantial 
new development. The area’s topography is 
another consideration. Its position at high 
ground, providing views towards London and 
Kent as well as to local landmarks, contributes to 
local character but also constrains certain types 
of development, such as tall buildings. Yet there 
remains a need to deliver new development in 
order to improve the liveability of the area’s 
neighbourhoods as well as the viability of its 
centres and other employment locations. The 
Local Plan sets out a strategy to help facilitate 
new investment within the West Area, maximising 
opportunities that are available whilst ensuring 
growth is effectively coordinated, with a clear 
framework that responds to the area’s valued 
built and natural assets, including its topography.
18.10 The West Area’s network of town and local 
centres is one of its defining features. It also 
presents some of the main opportunities for 
accommodating growth. A key strategic priority 
is to secure the long-term viability and vitality 
of these centres by improving their place 
qualities, also responding to their position near 
stations and other transport routes. This can be 
achieved by facilitating new investment within 
the centres and enhancing connections between 
them. Public realm enhancements along the B218, Stanstead Road (South Circular) and 
other key routes, using the Healthy Streets 
Approach, is necessary to support safe and 
convenient movement by walking and cycling, 
and to help make travel by public transport 
more efficient. The sensitive intensification 
of these strategic movement corridors will 
therefore be supported as a means to secure new 
investment. It is imperative that the town centres 
retain their distinctive qualities and maintain a 
complementary offer of retail provision, services 
and community facilities. Most of the area’s main 
development opportunities are at site allocations 
located within or around the centres, particularly 
the District Centres of Forest Hill and Sydenham 
as well as the Local Centres of Brockley and 
Kirkdale. The redevelopment of these sites will 
help to generate new investment locally.
18.11 The continued evolution of Forest Hill District 
Centre into a thriving community, commercial 
and cultural hub is an important aspect of the 
spatial strategy for the Borough. The Local Plan 
seeks to build on the existing strengths of the 
centre as a key visitor destination. This includes 
taking advantage of its position as a gateway 
to the Horniman Museum and Gardens, and 
ensuring the centre is supported by a wide range 
of daytime and night time activities. Havelock 
Walk and 118 Stansted Road are unique 
commercial locations with a mix of cultural and 
creative industries. Their presence and value is 
recognised through the designation of the Forest 
Hill Cultural Quarter. Live-work accommodation 
has been successfully integrated at Havelock 
Walk, and is the only location in the Borough 
where this development typology is supported. 
Whilst the District Centre is well served by public 
transport its amenity is adversely impacted by 
704the South Circular. We will therefore work with 
key stakeholders, including Transport for London 
and Network Rail, to secure the delivery of public 
realm enhancements wherever feasible. This 
may include, for instance, improvements to road 
crossings, and the station approach.
18.12 There are a number of designated and non-
designated employment sites in close proximity 
to the town centres that make an important 
contribution to the local economy. The renewal of 
these sites will be encouraged in order to deliver 
new modern workspace and jobs, as well as to 
improve the relationship between commercial 
and other neighbouring uses. In selected Locally 
Significant Industrial Sites, the co-location of 
commercial and other complementary uses will 
be supported. This includes sites in Forest Hill as 
well as Kirkdale, near Willow Way.
18.13 The West Area was once covered by the Great 
North Wood, which extended from New Cross 
to Croydon south of the Borough. Much of the 
woodland was lost by the 18h century, but a 
strong woodland character prevails with the 
abundance of large mature street and garden 
trees, nature reserves and green corridors 
along the railway embankments and cuttings, 
and allotments and other green spaces. The 
Lewisham Links are centred on the network of 
green infrastructure and other valued places, 
recognising the priority given to improving public 
access to them by walking and cycling.

Opportunities
18.16 The southern part of this site is located within 
Brockley Cross local centre. Redevelopment and 
site intensification, along with the introduction 
of a wider range of uses, will provide a more 
optimal use of land to support the vitality and 
viability of the local centre, including with new 
and improved workspace. Development will also 
enable public realm enhancements, including 
improvements to the station approach.
18.17 Development requirements
1. Landowners must work in partnership and  
in accordance with a masterplan, to ensure 
coordination, phasing and balance of uses across 
the site, in line with Policy DM3 (Masterplans 
and comprehensive development).
2. The maximum viable amount of employment 
floorspace must be re-provided, in line with 
Policy EC8 (Non-designated employment sites).
3.  Positive frontages with active ground floor frontages on Endwell Road and Shardeloes Road,  
4. Delivery of new and improved public realm in 
accordance with a site-wide public realm strategy, 
including enhancements to improve legibility, 
safety and access to the station.
5. Development proposals must protect and seek 
to enhance green infrastructure, including 
the SINC and green corridor along the railway 
embankment.
18.18 Development guidelines
1. Non-employment uses, including residential 
uses, must be sensitively integrated into the 
development in order to ensure the protection 
of amenity for all site users, along with safe 
and convenient access. This will require careful 
consideration of the operational requirements of 
existing and potential future employment uses.
2. Building heights should respond positively to 
the site surroundings including the residential 
buildings along the site’s northern and eastern 
boundaries. Taller elements should be sited on 
the western side of the site, facing the railway.
3. The wall surrounding the timber yard and the 
blank, ground level façade along Endwell Road 
should be removed in order to enhance natural 
surveillance, and the public realm.
4. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
manage surface water and divert existing sewers

uses. Reconfiguration of buildings and spaces to 
facilitate a new layout with new and improved 
routes, both into and through the site along with 
public realm and environmental enhancements. 
Opportunities
18.49 The site comprises the Willow Way Locally 
Significant Industrial Site, which is located 
adjacent to Upper Sydenham/Kirkdale local 
centre and spans both sides of Willow Way. 
The site includes vacant land and a mix of 
lower density employment uses and 19 existing 
residential units. Redevelopment and site 
intensification, along with the co-location of 
commercial and other uses, will provide a more 
optimal use of land and enable the delivery of 
new and improved workspace to support the 
long-term viability of the LSIS. Development 
will also enable public realm enhancements to 
improve the quality of the townscape around 
the local centre, and help to make the area a 
safer and more attractive place for business and 
community activity.
18.50 Development requirements
1. Landowners must work in partnership and in 
accordance with a masterplan, to ensure the 
appropriate co-ordination, phasing and balance 
of uses across the site, in line with Policy DM3 
(Masterplans and comprehensive development). 
This must address the site’s relationship with 
the Upper Sydenham / Kirkdale local centre, 
to improve the functional relationship with 
neighbouring uses and the public realm, along 
with townscape character. 2. The site contains an MOT centre which is 
in active use. Development proposals must 
adequately address the operational requirements 
of the MOT centre in order to secure a viable 
future for it. The landowner of the MOT centre 
must be consulted through the masterplan 
process.
3. Development must not result in a net loss of 
industrial capacity, or compromise the function of 
the employment location, in line with Policy EC6 
(Locally Significant Industrial Sites).
4. Positive frontages along Willow Way, Dartmouth 
Road and Sydenham Park, with active ground 
floor frontages. Positive frontages elsewhere 
throughout the site, where new routes are 
introduced. 
5. The site must be fully re-integrated with the 
surrounding street network to improve access 
and permeability in the local area. This includes a 
clear hierarchy of routes, with a legible and safe 
network of walking and cycle routes, through 
the site. Particular consideration must be given 
to the access and servicing arrangements for 
commercial uses.
6. Delivery of new and improved public realm and 
open space, in accordance with a site-wide public 
realm strategy. 
7. Development proposals must not adversely 
impact on the amenity of the public house 
located outside of the site boundary, in line with 
Policy EC19 (Public houses).

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
18 LEWISHAM’S WEST AREA18.51 Development guidelines
1. Non-employment uses, including residential 
uses, must be sensitively integrated into the 
development in order to ensure the protection 
of amenity for all site users, along with safe 
and convenient access. This will require careful 
consideration of the operational requirements of 
existing and potential future employment uses.
2. Main town centre uses may be acceptable but 
these must be ancillary to the commercial uses 
and not detract from viability of the local centre.
3. Enhanced permeability off Willow Way will be an 
essential element of the design. Proposals will 
be expected to investigate, and where feasible, 
deliver a new route(s) linking from Willow Way to 
Kirkdale and Dartmouth Roads.
4. Additional planting and landscaping should 
be integrated to enhance the public realm and 
encourage movement by walking and cycling 
along Willow Way.
5. Development should provide for a coherent 
building line along Willow Way, taking into 
account the redevelopment of the former 
Sydenham Police Station site.
6. The design of development must respond 
positively to the local context, giving particular 
consideration to heritage assets, including the 
Sydenham Park Conservation Area, Halifax Street 
Conservation Area, Jews Walk Conservation 
Area, Area of Special Local Character, as well as 
listed building and locally listed buildings along 
Kirkdale.
7. Applicants should work in partnership with 
Thames Water and engage with them early to 
manage surface water, divert existing sewers 
where applicable and ensure infra-structure 
upgrades are delivered ahead of the site being 
occupied through a housing phasing plan.

19 DELIVERY AND MONITORINGExplanation
19.1 The Local Plan sets out an ambitious strategy 
to secure new investment in the Borough and 
coordinate this to support Good Growth. It has 
been informed by an Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
(IDP). This provides a detailed assessment of the 
infrastructure required to support Lewisham’s 
neighbourhoods and communities now and in 
the future, taking into account the levels of 
growth planned over the long-term. The Local 
Plan and its companion IDP are intended to 
be used both by the Council and its partners.  
These documents have therefore been prepared 
through extensive public consultation and 
engagement.  The Local Plan will help to ensure 
that infrastructure providers, including public 
sector bodies, understand Lewisham’s future 
needs so that they can appropriately plan for and 
allocate funding towards these.
19.2 The Council is legally required to review its Local 
Plan every five-years in order to ensure it is 
up-to-date. Authority Monitoring Reports are 
published annually and help to assess progress 
on the delivery of the Local Plan. The IDP will 
also be subject to regular review and updating 
over the plan period. This will ensure it takes 
account of infrastructure that has been delivered 
and new infrastructure programmes and service 
priorities that come to light. The Council will 
continue to liaise with infrastructure providers to 
inform updates to the IDP .19.3 We will continue to work positively and 
proactively with key stakeholders including local 
communities and community groups, businesses,, 
landowners, developers, public sector bodies and 
the wider public to ensure the successful delivery 
of the Local Plan.. The Statement of Community 
Involvement (SCI) sets out the Council’s 
procedures for consulting the public on planning 
decisions. This includes the preparation of the 
Local Plan and guidance documents as well as 
the determination of planning applications. The 
SCI supports our wider corporate aims to increase 
public involvement in Council decisions, enhance 
transparency and openness in local democracy, 
and promote effective decision making. This 
includes implementation of the recommendations 
of the Lewisham Local Democracy Review.126
126 The 57 recommendations made by the Local 
Democracy Review were agreed by Mayor & Cabinet and 
Full Council in spring 2019. Full Council also approved the 
appointment of eight councillors to the renewed Local 
Democracy Working Group, which will oversee delivery of 
the recommendations.

19 DELIVERY AND MONITORING742Opposite: Leisure CentreDM2 Infrastructure funding and planning obligations
Community infrastructure levy
A The Council will set a Lewisham Community 
Infrastructure Levy which is payable on all 
qualifying development. CIL funding will 
be used to secure the delivery of inclusive, 
healthy and liveable neighbourhoods across 
the Borough that are well supported by 
infrastructure. A CIL Charging Schedule will be 
published and this will be subject to periodic 
review over the plan period.
B A portion of Lewisham CIL collected will be 
allocated towards neighbourhood priorities to 
help ensure that local areas are appropriately 
supported with infrastructure and benefit from 
investment generated by new development. 
The Council will work proactively with local 
communities to set priorities for the spending 
of neighbourhood CIL in Lewisham.
C Neighbourhood forums are strongly 
encouraged to identify priorities for the use of 
neighbourhood CIL in neighbourhood plans.
Planning obligations
D The Council will seek planning obligations 
on a case-by-case basis having regard to the 
relevant policy requirements of the statutory 
Development Plan, development specific 
impacts, appropriate mitigation (including 
additional facilities or requirements made 
necessary by the development), viability and 
the statutory tests for the use of planning 
obligations. Where financial contributions 
are required these will be index linked, on an 
upward basis only, in order to maintain the 
value of the planning obligation. E The following is a list of areas where planning 
obligations may be sought, recognising that 
other types of obligations may be necessary 
depending on the nature of a proposal and 
individual site circumstances:
a. Affordable housing
b. Transport and highways infrastructure and 
works
c. Sustainable transport and Healthy Streets
d. Public transport improvements
e. Parking controls and restrictions
f. Community and social infrastructure
g. Employment and skills training
h. Affordable workspace

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
19 DELIVERY AND MONITORING19.4 A wide range of strategic infrastructure projects 
will be required to support the levels of planned 
growth within Lewisham over the long-term. 
As well, specific measures may be needed on a 
site-by-site basis to ensure that additional needs 
for infrastructure generated by new development 
are positively managed and that any impacts 
arising are appropriately mitigated. The following 
section describes the main funding tools that are 
available to the Council to support the successful 
delivery of the Local Plan.
Community Infrastructure Levy
19.5 Both the Mayor of London and the Council 
have legal powers to introduce a Community 
Infrastructure Levy. This is a charge levied on 
certain types of new development and is non-
negotiable. It is an important tool to help fund 
the delivery of strategic infrastructure that is 
essential to support growth across London, 
particularly transport infrastructure. CIL is also 
vital to helping the Council secure infrastructure 
required for inclusive, healthy and liveable 
neighbourhoods across the Borough.
19.6 Most new development which creates net 
additional floor space of 100 square metres or 
more, or creates a new dwelling, is potentially 
liable for the levy. Some developments may 
be eligible for relief or exemption from the 
levy. This includes social housing, residential 
annexes and extensions, and houses and flats 
which are built by ‘self-builders’. There are 
strict criteria that must be met, and procedures 
that must be followed, to obtain the relief or 
exemption. Applicants are advised to refer to the 
Government’s Planning Practice Guidance for 
general information on the setting, collection and 
use of the levy. 19.7 The London Mayor has introduced a CIL that 
is applicable to qualifying development across 
London. The Council assists in administering the 
collection of CIL funding generated in Lewisham 
on behalf of the Mayor. We will seek to advise 
applicants on the latest information on the Mayoral 
CIL.
19.8 In addition, the Council adopted a CIL Charging 
Schedule in February 2015 which sets out the local 
levy rates within the Borough. This will be subject 
to periodic review and potential updating over the 
plan period. Changes to the CIL Charging Schedule 
may be necessary to respond to significant changes 
in the level of infrastructure provision required to 
support the planned levels of growth, or to take 
into account new evidence on development viability. 
Further information is available on the Council’s 
planning website.
19.9 A portion of the local CIL collected in Lewisham is 
set aside to be spent on neighbourhood priorities. 
The Council has formally agreed governance 
arrangements for the use of this neighbourhood 
Community Infrastructure Levy (NCIL). There 
are NCIL funds available to each ward within the 
Borough. Local residents and community groups are 
encouraged to assist in setting priorities for the use 
of these funds within the local area. Neighbourhood 
forums are strongly encouraged to set out priorities 
for the use of NCIL within neighbourhood plans. 
This will allow for an additional level of public 
engagement in the process of priority setting and 
help to ensure there are clear priorities in place to 
address neighbourhood plan objectives. Further 
information on the governance arrangements for 
NCIL, and opportunities to assist in priority setting, 
is available on the Council’s planning webpage.Explanation
744Planning obligations
19.10 As part of the process of determining 
planning applications, the Council may 
seek to enter into legal agreements with 
landowners and developers, and/or secure 
planning contributions. This is particularly 
where infrastructure is required to address 
the additional demand generated by new 
development proposals. The purpose of 
planning obligations is to make development 
acceptable in planning terms. Planning 
obligations will be sought to compensate and/
or mitigate the impact of a development, which 
without that mitigation, would render the 
development unacceptable in planning terms. 
Legal agreements and/or contributions will 
be negotiated on a case-by-case basis, taking 
into account the individual site circumstances 
and the mitigation measures required for the 
development proposed. Planning applications 
will be refused where appropriate mitigation 
measures are not provided or cannot otherwise 
be secured.
19.11 We have published a Planning Obligations 
Supplementary Planning Document. This 
sets out guidance on the types and scale 
of planning obligations that are likely to be 
sought in accordance with Lewisham’s statutory 
Development Plan. The SPD sets out our 
expectations on the process for securing planning 
obligations. Reduced contributions, where 
necessary (for example due to the exceptional 
costs of redeveloping a particular site) will be 
negotiated on an ‘open book’ basis based on 
the financial viability of the scheme. The Council 
will review and update its Planning Obligations 
SPD to ensure it appropriately aligns with the 
Development Plan.19.12 The London Plan sets out that planning 
contributions towards affordable housing and 
transport infrastructure share the equal highest 
priority, and this will be a key consideration 
where there is a need to prioritise contributions 
owing to reasons of financial viability of a 
development.
19.13 Financial obligations will be index linked (on 
an upwards basis only) in order to maintain the 
value of the obligation, from the date of the 
resolution to grant planning permission until 
the date that the full payment is received. In 
most cases the Retail Price Index (RPI) will be 
used for non-capital financial contributions 
(e.g. workplace training contributions) and the 
Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) index, or 
equivalent agreed by the Council, will be used for 
financial contributions towards a specific building 
or facility as it relates more closely to the cost of 
delivering a scheme.

19 DELIVERY AND MONITORING746DM3 Masterplans and comprehensive development
A Development proposals must be accompanied 
by a site masterplan where they form all 
or part of a site allocation, or in other 
circumstances specified by the Local Plan. 
The site masterplan will be expected to 
set out how development will contribute 
to delivery of the spatial strategy for the 
Borough. It must also suitably demonstrate 
that the proposal will not prejudice the future 
development of other parts of the site and 
adjoining land, or otherwise compromise the 
delivery of the site allocation and outcomes 
sought for the wider area.
B The site masterplan must be submitted at 
the outline or full planning application stage. 
Where an outline application is submitted, 
it should be accompanied by a full planning 
application for the first phase of the 
development. The masterplan will be required 
to comprise of:
a. An assessment of the site and its context 
to inform the overall development strategy;
b. A detailed site-wide masterplan that 
responds positively to the spatial strategy 
for the Borough, site specific development 
principles and guidelines, and other 
relevant planning policies; andc. A delivery strategy that identifies how the 
development will be implemented and 
managed over its lifetime. This strategy 
must address any relevant matters to 
be resolved such as land assembly and 
preparation, infrastructure requirements, 
development phasing and likely need for 
planning obligations and/or planning 
conditions, where appropriate.
C Proposals must address how the development 
site relates to neighbouring properties and the 
surrounding area, particularly in contributing 
to the delivery of the spatial strategy for the 
Borough. Where appropriate, applications will 
be required to be supported by a masterplan 
covering multiple sites in order to demonstrate 
the acceptability of the scheme both in terms 
of its immediate and wider context. This is 
additional to the site masterplan required by 
(A) and (B) above.
D Applicants must demonstrate that they 
have appropriately consulted the public 
through the masterplan process, including 
active engagement with the landowners and 
occupiers of the subject site along with those 
in other parts of the allocated site.

19 DELIVERY AND MONITORING19.14 In order to achieve the Local Plan’s vision and 
strategic objectives it will be important that 
all development proposals positively engage 
with and seek to deliver the spatial strategy 
for the Borough. This is particularly vital for 
those sites that have been allocated for their 
strategic role and potential to deliver new 
and improved housing, business space, public 
realm, facilities and other infrastructure to 
support our communities. The site allocations 
are comparatively large brownfield sites and 
can therefore add complexity in terms of their 
redevelopment. This may include a situation 
of multiple land ownership, fragmentation of 
existing uses and space, land remediation and 
need for new or upgraded infrastructure. The 
Council considers that these constraints are more 
likely to be overcome, and the optimal use of 
sites realised, where development is brought 
forward comprehensively and in line with a site-
wide masterplan.
19.15 To help ensure certainty of outcomes, the Council 
will seek that masterplans are submitted at the 
outline or full planning application stage. The 
masterplan should be informed by a baseline 
assessment of the site and its surrounds, drawing 
on the latest available evidence. This may include 
demographic data, economic and social indicators 
and/or information on the historical, natural 
and built environment. The site-wide masterplan 
itself should establish the overall approach 
to the function and form of development. 
The level of detail included in the masterplan 
should be commensurate with nature and scale 
of development proposed, along with site 
specific requirements. Depending on individual 
circumstances, matters to be addressed may include: historical and cultural context; land uses, 
quantum and distribution of development; layout 
and design; access, circulation and parking; 
open space and landscaping; and infrastructure 
(including transport, community and green 
infrastructure).
19.16 The delivery strategy is important to ensuring 
certainty on outcomes sought both for the 
individual scheme and the site allocation. One 
of the key aims of the masterplan process is to 
ensure that landowners and/or developers are 
liaising with each other and made aware of the 
planning objectives for the site and wider area. 
Coordination between landowners and other 
stakeholders, including infrastructure providers, 
will help to ensure that proposals do not 
prejudice each other, or the wider development 
aspirations for the Borough. Sites that are 
designed and brought forward comprehensively 
through the master plan process will help to 
alleviate issues that may arise through piecemeal 
development, are more likely to maximise wider 
public benefits.Explanation
748DM4 Land assembly
A To enable the delivery of the Local Plan and 
the spatial strategy for the Borough the 
Council will support land assembly to achieve 
comprehensive development. The Council will 
use compulsory purchase powers, only where 
necessary, to assemble land for development 
within the Borough where:
a. Landowners and/or developers, as 
appropriate, can demonstrate that:
i. There is a viable and deliverable 
development proposal that appropriately 
satisfies the Local Plan requirements; and
ii. They have made all reasonable efforts 
to acquire, or secure an option over, the 
land and/or building(s) needed, through 
negotiation.
b. Comprehensive redevelopment of the 
assembled site is necessary to deliver a 
strategic site allocation contained in the 
Local Plan (including the requirements of a 
masterplan where required); and
c. The development proposal for the 
assembled site will contribute to the delivery 
of the spatial strategy for the Borough, 
having particular regard to the Vision and 
place principle policies for the area within 
which the development is located.
B Where compulsory purchase is necessary, 
and determined to be an appropriate option 
for securing development that supports the 
delivery of the spatial strategy, applicants will 
be required to demonstrate how the associated 
costs will impact upon development viability.
749
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
19 DELIVERY AND MONITORING19.17 A comprehensive approach to development 
of sites will often be in the public interest, 
particularly to secure the successful delivery of 
the spatial strategy for the Borough. On larger 
sites, including site allocations, the piecemeal 
development or incremental building out of 
schemes might be more easily delivered in certain 
circumstances. However the constraints posed 
by site boundaries, neighbouring developments 
or land uses, along with infrastructure and 
utilities (whether at or below the surface), all 
have potentially limiting consequences for 
the design, scale, land use mix and viability of 
schemes. Across Lewisham and particularly in 
key strategic locations - such as Opportunity 
Areas, Areas for Regeneration and town centres 
- such consequences could depress the optimal 
use of land or impose limitations on coordinated 
planning and development of a site or an area. 
A comprehensive approach to development is 
advocated in order to ensure the achievement 
of wider regeneration and strategic growth 
objectives.
19.18 The necessity to use compulsory purchase powers 
is more likely on complicated strategic sites, 
particularly where there are multiple landowners 
and leaseholders.  The Council will always assess 
the most appropriate options for securing the 
successful delivery of the Local Plan. It will 
carefully consider the use of powers available to 
it in order to ensure new development is brought 
forward in a coordinated way, and delivered in 
the wider public interest.Explanation
750DM5 Meanwhile uses
A Development proposals for the meanwhile 
(temporary) use of vacant land or buildings  
will only be supported where the site or unit:
a. Is being actively marketed; or 
b. Falls within the boundary of a site allocation 
that is not expected to come forward for 
comprehensive redevelopment in the short 
term; or
c. Is located on land within a consented 
major development scheme, which is being 
delivered in phases; and
d. The meanwhile use sought:
i. Is appropriate to its location, with priority 
given to suitable employment generating, 
community or cultural uses;
ii. Will not adversely impact on the amenity 
of adjoining and neighbouring occupiers, 
in line with the Agent of Change 
principle;
iii. Does not preclude the permanent use 
of the site for appropriate commercial 
or main town centre uses, or prohibit 
delivery of the site allocation; and
iv. Will be temporary in nature.
B Development proposals for the meanwhile 
(temporary) use of vacant land and buildings 
within town centres and designated 
employment areas must not adversely impact 
on the viability of the town centre or function 
of the employment area in supporting 
commercial uses and activities.
751
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
19 DELIVERY AND MONITORINGExplanation
19.19 Vacant buildings and sites can have a detrimental 
impact on the vitality and viability of commercial 
and other areas. This is especially in town 
centre locations where vacant units can visually 
detract from local character and result in lower 
levels of footfall. The Local Plan seeks that the 
optimal use of land is made in the Borough 
including by ensuring that land and buildings 
do not go unnecessarily unused. The meanwhile 
(temporary) use of vacant buildings (including 
building units) or sites, where they provide for 
beneficial uses. This includes uses that support 
business development, community and cultural 
activities (particularly in Cultural Quarters) and 
those that help to address acute local housing 
needs.
19.20 Where meanwhile uses are proposed, applicants 
must submit evidence to demonstrate that the 
vacant unit or site is being actively marketed, 
including during the period of meanwhile activity, 
at market rates that are reasonable to the local 
economic area. The intention here is to ensure 
that sites or units are taken up for their intended 
use whilst recognising some flexibility is needed 
to respond to fluctuations in the market or other 
factors. If we consider that a site or unit has 
been made deliberately vacant in order to secure 
a temporary consent, the application will be 
refused.19.21 The Local Plan includes a number of strategic 
site allocations, some of which are expected to 
come forward over the medium to long-term. 
Our priority is to ensure that development 
is delivered as quickly as possible. However, 
there are circumstances where site allocations 
may take longer to be realised, such as when 
development is phased or time is needed to allow 
for coordination between different landowners. 
In the interim period we are keen to ensure that 
active uses are maintained wherever appropriate. 
19.22 Development proposals for meanwhile uses must 
not preclude the future permanent occupation 
of the site or unit for an appropriate main 
town centre, commercial or other use, taking 
into account relevant site allocation policies. 
Meanwhile uses must not have an adverse impact 
on the amenity of neighbouring properties or 
the local area. Where located in town centres 
or employment areas, meanwhile uses must not 
compromise the employment generating function 
of nearby sites in line with the Agent of Change 
principle, or otherwise harm the viability of the 
town centre.
19.23 The Council may consider the future use of Local 
Development Orders (LDO) allowing temporary 
uses in specific locations subject to certain 
conditions being satisfied.
19.24 Where meanwhile uses are approved they will be 
considered for monitoring purposes. This includes 
meanwhile residential uses, where conventional 
units and non-conventional bedrooms will be 
counted towards the Borough’s housing target. 
This approach is consistent with that advocated 
in the London Plan.
752DM6 Health impact assessments
A A desktop Health Impact Assessment (HIA) 
must be submitted with the following types of 
development proposals:
a. Major developments;
b. Developments located within an Air Quality 
Focus Area; and
c. Developments including the following uses:
i. Hot-food takeaways
ii. Betting shops;
iii. Education facilities;
iv. Health and social care facilities;
v. Leisure and community facilities; and
vi. Publicly accessible open space.
B Development proposals of a scale referable to 
the Greater London Authority must submit a 
detailed Health Impact Assessment.

19 DELIVERY AND MONITORINGExplanation
19.25 This policy supports the London Plan aims to 
create a healthy city by improving Londoners’ 
health and reducing health inequalities. It also 
supports the objectives set out in Lewisham’s 
Health and Wellbeing Strategy. HIAs will required 
for development proposals which are most likely 
to impact on public health outcomes whether 
by virtue of their large scale, nature of uses or 
location in an area of poor air quality. 
19.26 The London Healthy Urban Development Unit 
(HUDU) provides guidance on completing 
HIAs, which applicants should refer. This 
uses a checklist approach that can normally 
be completed as a desktop study. The HIA 
should be undertaken as early as possible in 
the planning and design process in order to 
identify opportunities for maximising public 
health benefits, minimising harm and addressing 
health inequalities. Development proposals 
must demonstrate how the HIA has been 
used to inform the design. The HIA can be 
completed as a standalone assessment or form 
part of an Integrated Impact Assessment, where 
appropriate. The scope of the HIA will depend on 
the nature, scale and location of development 
along with the potential impacts on public health 
and wellbeing.
19.27 Development proposals of a scale referable to 
the Greater London Authority must complete and 
submit a more extensive and full HIA.  
754DM7 Monitoring and review
A The implementation of the Lewisham Local 
Plan will be kept under review throughout 
the plan period, taking into account the Local 
Performance Indicators set out in Table 19.1 . 
Progress and performance outcomes towards 
the delivery of the Vision for Lewisham and 
the spatial strategy will be published annually 
in the statutory Authority Monitoring Report 
(AMR).
B Development viability in the Lewisham will be 
regularly reviewed over the plan period. Where 
evidence suggests that changes in land values 
are likely to significantly impact on the viability 
of different types of development, whether 
in particular areas of across the Borough, the 
Council will consider the need for a review of 
strategic approaches or policies.
755
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
19 DELIVERY AND MONITORINGExplanation
19.28 Monitoring is necessary to assess progress 
towards the implementation of the Local Plan 
over the plan period. The section sets out 
the monitoring framework against which the 
successful delivery of the Local Plan will be 
measured. The monitors will help to assess yearly 
performance. However, it is recognised that that 
spatial strategy is underpinned by the need for 
sensitively managed change and transformational 
investment (for example, in public transport 
infrastructure), which in some local areas or 
specific circumstances may take several years to 
begin to materialise.
19.29 Performance against Lewisham’s Local 
Performance Indicators (LPIs) will be published 
in the statutory Authority Monitoring Report 
(AMR). Performance metrics and figures will be 
accompanied by commentary to make reports 
more legible and user-friendly, and may be 
supported by additional monitoring information. 
The LPIs will help to supplement, and should be 
read alongside, the Key Performance Indictors 
(KPIs) used for monitoring of the London Plan.
19.30 The LPIs are considered to be the key indicators 
for assessing policy performance and overall 
implementation of the Local Plan. The AMR will 
include a more comprehensive and detailed set of data, which will help to complement and put 
into context the LPIs. This may include data that 
is not made available on an annual basis, such as 
the Indices of Multiple Deprivation and Census 
data, information within research reports and 
other technical evidence, and Council strategies. 
The AMR is therefore expected to evolve over 
time, however continuity will be ensured through 
a focus on the LPIs.
19.31 Where monitoring clearly indicates that a 
strategic objective, elements of the Local Plan 
spatial strategy or specific plan targets are not 
being delivered, we will assess the reasons 
for this and may consider, as appropriate, 
contingency measures or other actions. This may 
include single issue reviews and corresponding 
updates to the Local Plan.
19.32 We will regularly monitor development viability 
as part of the Local Plan monitoring. Where 
evidence suggests that changes in land values 
are likely to significantly impact on the viability 
of different types of development, whether 
in particular areas of across the Borough, the 
Council will consider the need for a review 
of strategic approaches or policies. This is 
particularly in respect of requirements for 
affordable housing. For example, where land 
values increase as a result of investment in 
strategic infrastructure (such as the Bakerloo 
line extension), we will seek to ensure that the 
maximum viable amount of genuinely affordable 
housing is secured on a site by site basis.

Further information on proposals for public houses 
This Appendix must be read in conjunction with 
draft Local Plan policy EC19 (Public Houses), 
which sets out requirements for submission of 
viability and marketing information to support 
certain typThis Appendix must be read in 
conjunction with Local Plan policy EC19 (Public 
Houses), which sets out requirements for 
submission of viability and marketing information 
to support certain types of development 
proposals. The Council may use its discretion in 
the application of the requirements on a case-by-
case basis. This may include, for instance, to take 
provide flexibility where development proposals 
involve the retention of a public house in-situ.
Viability statement 
In order to ensure that the Council can make 
a sound assessment when a change of use is 
proposed, applicants will be required to submit a 
Viability Statement. 
This will need to include:
1. Evidence in the form of at least the last three 
trading years of audited accounts.
2. All reasonable efforts have been made to 
preserve the public house (including all 
diversification options explored) and evidence 
supplied to illustrate that it would not be 
economically viable to retain the building or 
site for its existing use class. Examples of the 
initiatives or proposals that could be explored are 
as follows: 
a. a. adding a kitchen and serving food, or 
improving the existing food offer 
b. making the pub, garden, food offer more 
‘family-friendly’ c. providing events and entertainment such as 
quiz nights, amplified or non-amplified live 
music, comedy/cabaret nights 
d. hiring rooms out or otherwise providing a 
venue for local meetings, community groups, 
businesses, youth groups, children’s day 
nurseries 
e. offering take-away food and off-licence 
services 
f. f. provision of bed & breakfast or other guest 
accommodation 
g. sharing the premises with other businesses 
h. altering business and operating hours.
Marketing statement 
The Council will require clear evidence of 
appropriate marketing to show a lack of 
demand for the public house. This will mean the 
submission of a Marketing statement including 
the following information:
1. Details of the company/person who carried out 
the marketing exercise.
2. The marketing process should last for at least 36 
months.
3. The asking price should be pre-agreed in writing 
with the local planning authority following 
independent valuation (funded by the developer) 
by a professional RICS valuer with expertise 
in the licensed leisure sector and who is not 
engaged to market the property. 
787
Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
20 APPENDICES4. The marketing exercise should be sufficiently 
thorough and utilise all available forms of 
advertising media and therefore include as a 
minimum: 
a. a for Sale/for Rent signboard 
b. b. adverts in the local press 
c. adverts in appropriate trade magazines/ 
journals 
d. adverts on appropriate trade websites 
e. adverts through both national and local estate 
agents (including their websites) and 
f. a targeted mail shot or email to an agreed list 
of potential purchasers. 
Local consultation and use of the public 
house by community and voluntary 
organisations 
The use of public house space for community 
groups is a valued resource and evidence will 
be required demonstrating consultation has 
taken place with local community and voluntary 
organisations. The applicant will be required 
to carry out an assessment of the needs of the 
community for community facilities to show that 
the existing or former public house is no longer 
needed and that alternative provision is available 
in the area.
Where there is local need, this use should be 
retained or replaced within the building, unless 
an alternative approach can be identified and 
agreed. The retention of the ground floor for 
non-residential use will help maintain street 
activity and a mixed use neighbourhood.
The Council may also consider adding certain 
public houses to the Community Assets register 
if the community support for their retention is 
significant
788The trajectory has been updated, informed by the 
latest Starts and Completions Survey (which had 
not been undertaken at the time the trajectory 
was previously published for the September 2022 
Mayor and Cabinet). This update provides an 
opportunity to align the site phasing with the 
results of the survey and ensure site delivery is 
more realistic and less ambitious than before. The 
trajectory will continue to be updated as the Plan 
progresses towards adoption.

Lewisham Local PlanPART ONE  | PART TWO  | PART THREE  | PART FOUR  | PART FIVE
20 APPENDICESKey findings 
The site allocations will supply 24,414 (74%) 
new homes throughout the 20 year Plan period 
(2020/21 – 2039/40), consisting of:
• 7,085 (29%) in the Central Area
• 12,921(53%) in the North Area
• 1,244 (5%) in the East Area
• 2,262 (9%) in the South Area
• 901 (4%) in the West Area.
Other large consented sites will supply 1,602 
(5%) new homes throughout the 20 year Plan 
period.
Small site windfalls will supply 7,151 (22%) new 
homes throughout the 20 year Plan period. The 
small sites will form an important contribution in 
being able to meet the housing supply targets.
The majority of the supply comes from the 
North Area, followed by the Central Area.  This is 
because the site allocations are focussed towards 
the north and central parts of the borough, 
where the Opportunity Area is located and in 
other highly accessible locations, such as major 
town centres and along the A21 corridor.
Overall, there will be a baseline supply of 
33,178 new homes throughout the 20 year Plan 
period, consisting of site allocations, other large 
consented sites and small site windfalls. This 
rises to 35,652 new homes if growth from an 
additional 2,474 new homes in the Bell Green 
area is taken into account.  The baseline supply of housing has been 
assessed against the 10 year London Plan target 
as well as the 5 and 15 year NPPF targets.  All of 
these targets have been exceeded, as shown in 
the tables below.  
This demonstrates that sufficient homes can be 
delivered within the 5 and 15 year period.  
The NPPF does not require the Local Plan 
housing supply to be assessed beyond the 15 
year target period. However, the Local Plan 
runs for 20 years and the housing trajectory 
demonstrates that there will continue to be a 
supply of housing provided in the longer term.
The Council will keep under review the Local 
Plan’s housing targets and performance against 
the delivery of these targets. In particular, the 
longer term housing supply will be reassessed 
when the next London wide SHLAA becomes 
available, as part of the review of the London 
Plan. Where changes to the London Plan 
borough-level housing targets are made the 
local plan review process will be used to ensure 
Lewisham’s Local Plan remains in general 
conformity with the London Plan.

YEARSTARGET ASSESSMENT
London 
Plan -10 
year target2019/20 – 
2028/29Lewisham’s target for a 10 year 
period is 16,670 (1,667 p.a.), 
incorporating a small sites target of 
379 p.a.The site allocations, other large consented sites and small 
site windfalls will supply 17,918 new homes between 
2019/20 – 2028/29. The supply of housing during the 
10 years exceeds the target.
NPPF - 5 
year target2023/24 – 
2027/28Lewisham’s target is 2,212 p.a. or 
11,060 over the 5 year period. This 
consists of 3 components:
• London Plan housing target: 
1,667 p.a. 
• An appropriate buffer: 5% (or 
83 units p.a.) has been added to 
the 1,667 annual target, given 
Lewisham’s 87% performance in 
the last Housing Delivery Test.  
• A backlog: completions during 
2019/20 to 2021/22 amounted 
to 2,231 compared to the London 
Plan target of 5,001 over the 
same period. This creates an 
undersupply of 2,770 new homes 
as at the end of 2021/22.  This 
backlog will be catered for by the 
end of the first 5 years (2027/28) 
and is equivalent to 462 p.a.The site allocations, other large consented sites and 
small site windfalls will provide specific deliverable sites 
amounting to 12,414 new homes between 2023/24 
– 2027/28. The supply of housing during the 5 years 
exceeds the target. 
NPPF - 
Number of 
deliverable 
years2023/24 – 
2027/28Lewisham’s 5 year supply is assessed 
against the annual target of 2,212 
pa (1,667 p.a. plus 5% buffer of 
83 units p.a. and 462 p.a. backlog), 
to demonstrate more than 5 years’ 
worth of supply.The site allocations, other large consented sites and small 
site windfalls will supply 12,414 new homes between 
2023/24 – 2027/28.  When divided by 2,212 p.a. there 
will be 5.61 deliverable years, exceeding the target.  The 
target can also be exceeded if the buffer is increased 
to 10% (with 5.41 deliverable years) or 20% with 5.04 
deliverable years. 
NPPF - 15 
year target2023/24 – 
2037/38Lewisham’s target is 27,730 over 
the 15 year period.  This consists of 
2,212 p.a. for years 1-5, then the 
target of 1,667 p.a. has been rolled 
forward for years 6-15.The site allocations, other large consented sites and small 
site windfalls will supply 29,854 new homes between 
2023/24 – 2037/38. The supply of housing during the 
15 years exceeds the target.

2039/40Land to accommodate at least 10% 
of the target on sites no larger than 
1 hectare. • 2,195 or 20% of the 5 year target (11,060) will be 
provided on site allocations and other large consented 
sites of 1 hectare or less. This rises to 4,090 (37%) if 
small site windfalls are taken into account.
• 3,379 or 12% of the 15 year target (27,730) will be 
provided on site allocations and other large consented 
sites of 1 hectare or less. This rises to 9,064 (33%) if 
small site windfalls are taken into account.
• 4,765 or 14% of the supply across the 20 year plan 
period (33,178) will be on site allocations and other 
large consented sites of  1 hectare or less. This rises 
to 11,919 (36%) if small site windfalls are taken into 
account.
• Any additional small site windfalls will increase this 
supply further.
