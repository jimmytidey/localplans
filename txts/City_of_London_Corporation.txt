City of London Local Plan 
Proposed Submission Draft 
March 2021  
  Foreword  
I have pleasure in presenting the City o f London Corporation’s Proposed Submission 
Draft Local Plan for consultation . The foundations of our Plan are to create a more 
vibran t and sustainable future as we look forward to emerging from the Covid- 19 
Pandemic and following the UK’s departure from the European Union. We have 
furthe r updated the Plan to take account of recen t events, whilst ensuring that it 
remains flexible and adaptab le to further change. 
Our Plan is a plan for growth , but not growth a t any cost. It complemen ts the City 
Corporation’s innovative and groundbreaking Climate Action Strateg y, setting out 
how developmen t will contribute towards delivery o f a net zero carbon City o f London 
by 2040. It builds upon our ambitious Transport Strateg y, seeking to reduce 
congestion and deliver improvemen ts in the public realm , road safety and air quality, 
providing for freigh t and servicing consolidation and encouraging active transpo rt and 
public transport. It highligh ts the need for the Ci ty to be a vibrant visitor and cultural 
destination, and a greener and healthier place in which to live, wo rk and visit. 
The draft Plan sets out a positive view of the City’s futu re, with the Ci ty remaining an 
attract ive place to do busine ss or vi sit. We may see working patterns change, and 
businesse s may change the way the y use their space , but ultimately, we believe that 
there will remain a demand for the modern, flexib le and adaptab le space which the 
Plan seeks to provide , as there is a focus on quali ty of space and how it enables 
business and commerce to thrive. 
People are, of course, at the heart of this Plan , whether the y are residents, workers 
or visitors. We want to see healthy development, which means the Ci ty remains 
attract ive to world-class talent, enhance s opportunity for all and contributes to 
London ’s and the UK’s continued success. 
As we approach the final stages o f our Loca l Plan preparation, I encourage all 
stakeholders to respond to this consultation. Although the consultation process will 
be differen t due to the pandemic, the City Corporation is committed to active public 
engagemen t on this new Plan through virtual forms o f communication . To realise our 
ambitions for the City and deliver the increasingly attractive , health y and inclusive 
City we all want to see, we need to hear you r views.

Introduction 
1.1. What is the Local Plan? 
1.1.1. The Local Plan is a plan for the future development of the City of London, 
setting out what type of development the City Corporation expects to take place 
and where. The Local Plan sets out the City Corporation’s vision, strategy and 
objectives for plannin g the Square Mile, together with policies that guide 
decisions on planning applications. The Local Plan includes two Policies Maps 
showing which policies apply to specific locations. 
1.2. Why is the City preparing a new Local Plan? 
1.2.1. The current City of London Lo cal Plan was adopted in January 2015 and plans 
for development requirements up to 2026. It is important that the City’s planning 
framework remains responsive and flexible to address changing circumstances, 
whilst providing a clear vision for how a future C ity should look. 
1.2.2. Local Plans are required to look ahead over a minimum 15-year period to 
anticipate and respond to long -term requirements and opportunities , such as 
those arising from major improvements in infrastructure. However, they must 
also be reviewed at least every five years to take account of changing 
circumstances affecting the area, or any relevant changes in national policy. 
1.2.3. Since the City’s current Local Plan was adopted, the Government has made a 
number of changes to the plannin g system through its planning reform agenda, 
with notable changes being made to permitted development rights and the Use 
Classes Order during 2020. As a result, a number of policies need updating to 
ensure they remain up -to-date and responsive to national policy. In addition, the 
Mayor of London is reviewing the London Plan which provides a strategic 
planning framework for London for the period up to 2041. 
1.2.4. By preparing a new Local Plan covering the period to 2036, the City 
Corporation will be able to addres s revised national and London Plan policy , 
whilst maintaining a positive planning framework to meet the City’s long -term 
needs. 
1.3. The stages of preparing the Local Plan 
1.3.1. The Proposed Submission Local Plan, titled City Plan 2036 (the ‘Plan’) , is the 
third stage of preparing a new local plan. The first stage of the process was the 
Issues and Options stage in 2016 , during which consultation took place on the 
key planning issues facing the City and on the potential options that should be 
considered to address the m. The second stage, the draft Local Plan , was a 
consultation on a full draft Plan during later 2018 and early 2019 .

    1.3.2. Since then, the City Corporation has analysed the consultation findings and 
undertaken further evidence gathering to prepare the final stage , the Proposed 
Submission Plan. 
1.3.3. Following consultation on the Proposed Submission Plan, it will be submitted to 
the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government . The 
Secretary of State will then appoint an independent planning Inspector to 
examine the submitted Plan, which is expected to be adopted in 2022. 
1.3.4. Figure 1 illustrates the stages in the preparation of City Plan 2036 , together 
with an indicative timescale .

  1.4. Policy context 
1.4.1. This Plan is being prepared in an era of significant and rapid change and has 
been deliberately drafted to provide a flexible policy framework which 
encourages appropriate development and is responsive and adaptable to 
change. 
1.4.2. In particular, the Plan seeks to provide a flexible, resilient policy framework 
which responds to three fundamental health and well -being, environmental and 
economic influences: Covid -19, climate change, and the UK’s departure from the 
European Uni on. 
Climate change 
1.4.3. The threat from climate change is one of the most serious threats we face 
today. It extends beyond environmental challenges and has the potential to 
affect economic prosperity, social justice and global stability. Wide ranging 
responses are essential, encompassing individual local actions, local, strategic 
and national government programmes, business and community scale initiatives 
and global agreements. Scientific evidence indicates that the climate is already 
changing, and that action i s needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. 
1.4.4. The City Corporation has long been a champion of clean air, open space 
provision, sustainability and, more recently, green finance, recognising that a 
healthy environment is critical to business and personal well-being. It has in 
2020 adopted a Climate Action Strategy which sets out a pathway to achieving 
net zero emissions for both the City Corporation’s activities and the wider 
activities of businesses and residents in the City of London. The Strategy and, 
more importantly, the actions outlined will ensure the Square Mile and City 
Corporation achieve net zero carbon by 2040 and make a positive contribution 
to tackling climate change, are resilient to the risks of climate change and seize 
the opportunities pr esented by the transition to a low -carbon economy. 
Covid -19 pandemic 
1.4.5. Much of this Plan was drafted prior to the outbreak of the Covid -19 pandemic, 
which has had significant health, well -being, environmental and economic 
impacts locally and globally. As med ical treatments are discovered and rolled 
out, including potential vaccines, the severity of these health impacts is expected 
to reduce and communities will recover in the medium term. However, the 
pandemic is also leading to behavioural changes; some are temporary, but 
some are likely to become established as part of the ‘new normal’. The 
acceleration of existing trends and the creation of new trends both need to be 
taken into account when planning for the medium and longer term. Therefore, 
the Plan is loo king beyond the current pandemic to a period when a probable 
vaccine has enabled the City to once more provide a vibrant centre of business 
creativity and innovation which harnesses the potential of existing and new 
trends. 
7  
 
    
 
  
   
 
   
  
   
   
     
   
  
  
    
  
    
   
 
   
 
 
     
    
  
 
 
   
  
 
 
    
   
 
 
   
    
    
  
 
    
   
  1.4.6. Throughout its long history the City of London has been a centre for creative 
innovation and collaboration, bringing business and people together. The Covid -
19 pandemic has in the short term shifted much of the City’s business online 
with many City workers using modern technology to work from home, and 
consequently significant reductions in journeys into the City and footfall within it. 
Whilst the use of digital technology and remote working will remain important to 
the success of many City businesses in the future, reliance solely on rem ote 
working can have longer term drawbacks as it can limit the scope of the creative 
innovation, collaboration and informal business relationships that the City thrives 
upon. Therefore, it is expected that the City will remain an attractive base for a 
wide range of existing and new businesses, operating more flexibly with a 
blended approach of in -office and remote working, to meet the changing 
business environment, space needs and work and lifestyle expectations of their 
workforce. There is an opportunity t o transform City workplaces to offer a rich 
and fulfilling experience for City workers, with the office becoming a place for 
socialising, meeting, sharing and collaboration. The return of City workers will 
bring vitality to provide a boost to businesses th at rely on high footfall, including 
retail, food and beverage and support services to the City’s offices, that have 
been particularly affected by Covid -19. 
1.4.7. Although the pace and scale of future growth in the City of London is uncertain 
in the short term, t he longer term geographical, economic and social 
fundamentals underpinning the success of the City as a vibrant centre of 
business creativity and innovation remain in place. Strong interest in pre -
application planning advice and investment suggest continue d confidence in the 
City as a place in which to do business. The ways that people live, work, travel 
and use city centres will in the future be different, but the City will continue to be 
an attractive and sustainable meeting place where people and busines ses come 
together for creative innovation. 
1.4.8. The City Corporation will work closely with national, regional and local 
government, landowners and investors, businesses and residents to ensure that 
the City of London remains successful. It is acknowledged that the pandemic will 
have short and perhaps medium -term financial implications for the City 
Corporation and for Transport for London, which may impact on, or delay, 
implementation of some policy aspirations and will need to be closely monitored. 
Nonetheless, this Plan will provide a framework to give confidence to those who 
wish to be involved in and to invest in the City and it has been written to be 
adaptable to new changes and challenges as they present themselves. 
UK trading relationships 
1.4.9. As a world leadi ng financial and professional services centre, the future 
prosperity of the City will depend to a large extent on the international and 
national economic context including future trading relationships. The UK’s 
departure from the European Union is leading to new trading relationships and 
patterns. The City’s reputation for expertise and innovation will be particularly 
important as it adapts its existing strengths in financial and professional 
services, and develops new strengths, to suit changing global cir cumstances.

 1.4.10. The Local Plan is influenced by national and London -wide planning policies 
and guidance, as well as plans and strategies produced by neighbouring 
boroughs and a range of statutory bodies. 
National p lanning policy and guidance 
1.4.11. Local Plans are required to be consistent with national planning policy 
contained in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The NPPF sets 
out the broad policy approach to be taken across a range of planning issues and 
establishes a presumption in f avour of sustainable development. Further detail is 
provided in the Planning Practice Guidance (PPG), an online resource which is 
regularly updated to ensure guidance remains current . 
1.4.12. The Government’s planning reform agenda has resulted in a number of 
chan ges to national legislation and guidance. These changes, including those 
brought forward during 2020 to permitted development rights and the Use 
Classes Order, have been incorporated into this Plan. The Government has 
published a Planning White Paper outli ning further fundamental changes to the 
planning system in England which would impact upon the preparation and 
content of local plans and the operation of development management. These 
reforms, if enacted, will be considered through a subsequent review of the City 
of London’s Local Plan. 
The London Plan and other Mayoral strategies 
1.4.13. The Mayor of London has a duty to prepare a spatial development strategy, 
the London Plan, and to keep it under review. The City’s Local Plan, like those 
produced by the London b oroughs, must be in general conformity with the 
London Plan. The London Plan forms part of the statutory development plan for 
the City of London, along with the City’s Local Plan. The Local Plan has been 
prepared in alignment with the Mayor’s Publication London Plan (December 
2020). 
1.4.14. The Mayor produces supplementary planning guidance to provide further 
detail on particular policies in the London Plan . In addition, the Mayor publishes 
a range of other strategies, including those relating to transport, the 
environment, economic development, housing and culture . These documents 
have been taken into account in the preparation of the City’s Local Plan. 
Neighbourhood Plans 
1.4.15. Neighbourhood plans should support the delivery of strategic policies set out 
in a local plan. Once approved, a neighbourhood plan becomes part of the 
development plan for the neighbourhood area and is given the same legal status 
as a local plan . The local planning authority must co-operate with a 
neighbou rhood forum in the preparation of neighbourhood plans , providing 
assistance as required . 
1.4.16. At the time of preparation of City Plan 2036 , no neighbourhood forum ha s 
been established in the City of London and no neighbourhood plans are in 
preparation or have been adopted . The Ci ty Corporation will co -operate with any

      neighbourhood forum in the preparation and adoption of a neighbourhood plan 
within the City of London administrative area in accordance with statutory 
requirement s. 
Duty to co -operate 
1.4.17. Local planning authorities are required by legislation to co -operate on 
planning issues that cross administrative boundaries. The duty requires local 
planning authorities to engage “ constructively, actively and on an ongoing basis” 
on strategic matters in plan-making, including sustainable development, land 
use and strategic infrastructure. 
1.4.18. The City Corporation already works closely and co -operates with its 
neighbouring boroughs, the Mayor of London and other par tners on strategic 
and cross boundary planning issues. National planning policy requires strategic 
policy -making authorities to prepare and maintain statements of common ground 
to demonstrate effective and ongoing joint working. The City Corporation liaising 
with the Mayor o f London, neighbouring boroughs and other duty to co-operate 
partners to agree statements of common ground to support the development of 
City Plan 2036 and the development plans and strategies of partners .

City Corporation strategies 
1.4.19. The Local Plan can help to facilitate the delivery of other City Corporation 
strategies where their objectives involve the use or development of land and

 provide s a mechanism to assist with co-ordinat ing and balanc ing the 
requirements of different strategies. 
1.4.20. In particular, the Local Plan is one of the mechanism s through whic h the City 
Corporation’s Corporate Plan and Climate Action Strategy will be implemented. 
The Corporate Plan sets out the City Corporation’s overarching strategic 
direction and is structured around the three pillars of society , economy and 
environment. Although the Corporate Plan has a shorter time horizon than the 
Local Plan (2018 -23), it is a v isionary and forward -looking document and City 
Plan 2036 complements and helps deliver many of its objectives . The Climate 
Action Strategy set out the City Corporation’s pathway to achieve a zero carbon 
City by 2040. 
1.4.21. This Plan has been prepared alongside the City Corporation’s first Transport 
Strategy. Transport plays a key role in enabling and accommodating 
development, and the way the City grows affects demand for travel and public 
space. Reflecting this interrelationship , relevant policies and proposals in City 
Plan 2036 and the Transport Strategy are aligned . 
Evidence base 
1.4.22. The policies in City Plan 2036 have been i nformed by a range of evidence 
published by the City Corporation and by other organisations, including the 
Mayor of London in support of the London Plan. In some cases, additional 
studies have been undertaken to provide relevant and up-to-date evidence to 
support and justify the proposed policies. The evidence that underpins the draft 
Plan has been published on the City Corporation’s website at 
www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/cityplan2036 . This include s an assessment , 
undertaken in March 2020, of the combined effects of the policies in City Plan 
2036 on the overall viability of development in the Square Mile and the viability 
of delivering the Plan’s affordable housing targets. 
Integrated Impact Assessment 
1.4.23. City Plan 2036 has been informed by an Integrated Impact Assessment (IIA) , 
which combines the following assessment processes into a single document: 
•Sustainability Appraisal, including a Strategic Environmental Assessment;
•Equality Analysis ;
•Health Impact Assessment.
1.4.24. The IIA is an integral par t of the plan making process and has assessed draft 
policy options in terms of their compatibility with a range of sustainable 
development objectives; their implications for the promotion of equalities; and 
their implications for health and wellbeing. IIA is an iterative process and further 
assessment will be undertaken on changes to the Plan as a result o f pre-
submission consultation or modifications proposed through the Examination 
process . 
11  
 
    
     
 
 
       
  
   
  
    
       
       
 
     
 
    
     
   
    
    
 
 
 
      
 
   
    
 
  
 
     
  
   
 
   
     
  
 
    
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 1.4.25. A Habitat s Regulations Assessment has also been undertaken to assess 
whether the new Plan would have any significant effects on sites designated as 
being of European importance for their biodiversity . 
Other planning documents 
1.4.26. The Local Plan is supported by a number of other planning and City 
Corporation documents, including: 
• Local Development Scheme – this lists and describes all planning policy 
documents and the timetable for preparing them. 
• Statement of Community Involvement – this sets out the procedures and 
methods that will be used to consult and engage with the public in the 
preparation of planning policies, and the determination of planning 
applications. 
• Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) – these provide further 
explanation of Local Plan policies where this is needed. 
• The City of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) – CIL is a statutory 
charge on new development that is used to help fund the provision of 
infrastructure. A charging schedule specifies the rates that apply according 
to the land uses proposed. 
• The City of London Transport Strategy – this sets out a 25 year framework 
for future investment in and managemen t of the City’s streets, as well as 
measures to reduce the social, economic and environmental impacts of 
motor traffic and congestion. 
Implementation and delivery 
1.4.27. Implementation of the Local Plan will require partnership working and co -
operation with a ran ge of organisations, including developers, businesses, 
residents, community and amenity groups, transport and service providers, the 
Mayor of London and other London boroughs. 
1.4.28. A key mechanism for implementing the Local Plan is the consideration of 
plannin g applications through the development management process. Policies in 
this Plan apply to all development, including major new development, extensions 
to existing buildings, other major refurbishments and minor development, unless 
otherwise specifi ed in individual policies. The Local Plan should be read as a 
whole and applications for planning permission will be considered against all 
relevant policies in the Local Plan, the London Plan , the NPPF and any future 
neighbourhood plans . 
1.4.29. The City Corporati on will work closely with developers, occupiers and 
residents to ensure that City Plan 2036 is implemented and delivers positive 
improvements across the City. Where necessary, the City Corporation will use 
its powers of enforcement to ensure compliance wit h, and effective 
implementation of , Local Plan objectives and policies. The City Corporatio n’s

    Enforcement Plan has been adopted as a Supplementary Planning Document 
and sets out the principles and procedures that will be followed to ensure 
development is effectively regulated . Where necessary, enforcement action will 
be taken. The Enforcement Plan will be kept under review and amended to 
reflect new provisions arisin g out of changes to national, London -wide or local 
policy and/or practice and experience in implementation . 
1.4.30. The City Corporation will also use its powers in relation to issues such as 
management of the highways and public realm to help deliver the vision and 
policies in City Plan 2036 . It will, where necessary, use its land and property 
ownership to assist with site assembly and use its compulsory purchase powers 
to enable the high-quality development the City needs . An Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan has be en prepared identifying the infrastructure required to deliver the Plan 
and demonstrating the deliver ability of infrastructure during the plan period. It 
considers the investment plans of a range of infrastructure providers to identify 
potential gaps in fu nding , or trigger points which require a step change in levels 
of infrastructure. If gaps in the funding of infrastructure necessary to implement 
the Local Plan are identified, the City Corporation will seek alternative funding 
streams, including the use of CIL and other contributions from development, and 
will prioritise available funds. 
1.5. Structure of City Plan 2036 
1.5.1. The structure of City Plan 2036 is based on the three strategic aims of the City 
Corporation’s Corporate Plan , which are to : 
• Contribute to a flourishing society; 
• Support a thriving economy; and 
• Shape outstanding environments. 
1.5.2. Individual po licy topics are grouped within these broad themes . The first policy 
under each topic is a Strategic Policy, which addresses the strategic context, the 
relationship with other plans and strategies, and key planning issues. These 
policies are followed by Development Management Policies that will be used 
alongside the Strategic Policies in the consideration of applications for planning 
permission and related consents. 
1.5.3. A fourth theme of Key Areas of Change has been added to provide a 
framework for the area -specific policies within the Local Plan , and a fifth theme 
of Implementation has been added to focus on how the Plan will be delivered . 
1.5.4. The structure of the Plan is shown diagrammatically in Figure 3 and is not 
intended to represent any form of hierarchy .

Vision , Strategic Objectives and 
Spatial Strategy 
3.1. Contribute to a Flourishing Society 
The Vision…. 
3.1.1. The needs of the City’s diverse communities will be met in a sustainable and 
inclusive way, addressing the health, employment, education, leisure and 
housing needs of the variety of people who work, live and visit the City and 
incorporating the principles of Good Growth set out in the London Plan. 
3.1.2. The City’s population will enjoy good health and wellbeing. The health and 
wellbeing of the City’s communities will be integral to the design and delivery of 
new buildings, open spaces and the wider public realm, helping the City recover 
from the Covid -19 pandemic, provide inclusive and diverse spaces an d address 
the implications of climate change. Health inequality across the City will be 
reduced. Workers and residents will have access to a range of health services 
within the Square Mile and beyond. Partnership working with businesses and 
organisations both inside and outside the City will effectively tackle the wider 
causes of poor health by substantially improving the City’s air quality, promoting 
the recreational benefits of a healthy lifestyle, and ensuring inclusive access to 
good quality open spac es and recreational opportunities.

providing a high -quality living environment consistent with a city centre location. 
Housing w ill not be appropriate where it would conflict with the City’s global 
business role or result in poor residential amenity.  Affordable housing will be 
required on -site within the City. Where off -site contributions are exceptionally 
allowed, they will be us ed to deliver new affordable housing within and outside of 
the City, principally on the City’s managed housing estates, contributing to 
meeting London’s wider housing needs. 
3.1.5. The City will remain a safe place to work, live and visit.  Security measures will 
be designed into new buildings and public spaces, whilst ensuring that the City’s 
streets, walkways and open spaces are welcoming and inclusive. Where 
necessary, an area -wide approach to delivering collective security will be sought 
working with the City of London Police as a key partner . 
3.1.6. Good building design and effective management of night -time entertainment, 
combined with a broad mix of uses, will reduce the potential for anti -social

 behaviour and adverse impacts on residents and will help to maintain residential 
amenity. 
3.1.7. The City Corporation will work with partners to ensure that high qual ity training 
and learning facilities are accessible to all and that the City’s higher education 
institutions continue to enjoy an international reputation for excellence . City 
residents and those in neighbouring boroughs will develop the skills needed to 
enter careers in the City and benefit from the City’s prosperity. The City will offer 
equality of opportunity, accessibility and involvement so that people from across 
London’s diverse communities will have the chance to benefit from the many 
opportunities and facilities it offers.  
Strategic Objective: 
3.1.8. To contribute to the development of a flourishing society where people are safe 
and feel safe, enjoy good health and wellbeing, have access to suitable 
employment opportunities and housing in cohesive commun ities and live 
enriched lives, achieving their full potential. 
3.2. Support a Thriving Economy 
The Vision…. 
3.2.1. The City will remain the world’s leading international financial and professional 
services centre and a driver of the national economy, continually inno vating and 
developing new business areas and flexible ways of working , particularly in the 
technology and creative sector s, and delivering inclusive and sustainable growth 
and prosperity for its communities, London and the UK. 
3.2.2. The quantity and quality of new development, particularly office -led 
development, will meet growing business needs, supporting and strengthening 
opportunities for the continued collaboration a nd clustering of businesses that is 
vital to the City’s operation. 
3.2.3. The City will be open to new business, new ideas and innovations and new 
ways of working and collaborating , building upon the experience and lessons 
learned through the Covid -19 pandemic. New business floorspace will be flexible 
and adaptable creating spaces for collaboration and innovation and meeting the 
demands of different types of business occupiers and their workforces , including 
incubators, start -ups and other small and medium sized companies. There is an 
opportunity for the City’s cultural offer to be central to its recovery and future 
resilience. Office space will be complemented by other accessible commercial, 
cultural and leisure uses adding vibrancy and animation to the City’s s treets and 
benefitting the City’s diverse communities . 
3.2.4. The number of business and tourist visits to the City will significantly increase 
as the City is recognised for its world -class cultural and creative facilities.

  3.2.5. The City’s retail offer will adapt to changing demands, offering a range of 
meanwhile and complementary services to the City’s wider business and cultural 
offer and contributing to the City’s development as an evening and 7 -day a week 
retail, leisure and cu ltural destination.  Retail growth will be focused on the 
Principal Shopping Centres of Cheapside, Liverpool Street/Moorgate, 
Leadenhall Market and Fleet Street. Smaller retail , collaboration and cultural 
uses will be provided across the City, animating gr ound floor spaces and 
meeting local worker and resident needs. 
3.2.6. The City’s continued economic success will be underpinned by world -leading 
digital connectivity and data services both within buildings and in the public 
realm. The provision of utilities and infrastructure will anticipate the demands set 
by the City’s growth, funded in part through the Community Infrastructure Levy 
and planning obligations . 
Strategic Objective: 
3.2.7. To support a thriving economy, maintaining the City’s position as a global hub 
for innovation in financial and professional ser vices, commerce and culture. 
3.3. Shape Outstanding Environments 
The Vision…. 
3.3.1. The City will be physically well connected and responsive . Sustainable travel 
patterns and modes of transport will be promoted and public transport capacity 
increased, principally through the opening of the Elizabeth Line, and the 
Northern Line/Bank Station Upgrade. 
3.3.2. The City’s streets will provide an attractive and safe environment for walking 
and cycling. Pavement widening and reallocation of road space for pedestrian or 
cycle use, allied with increased planting and greenery, will provide more space 
for moving around , building on the initiatives put in place during the Covid -19 
pandemic. Traffic reduction and improvements to the City’s streets and junctions 
will transform the safety, look and feel of the City’s street network. 
3.3.3. Partnership working with City businesses and developers will minimise the 
number of delivery and servicing trips into the City and will reduce congestion 
through consolidation and by re -timing trips to take place outside of peak hours. 
The majority of last mile deliveries will be undertaken by z ero emission vehicles, 
and the City’s air quality will significantly improve as a greater share of 
motorised traffic switches to electric or other zero emission modes. 
3.3.4. Use of the River Thames by commuters and for freight and servicing will 
significantly in crease as the Thames becomes a major corridor for the 
movement of people and the transport of materials including construction and 
deconstruction materials, waste, freight and general goods. 
3.3.5. The City will remain a centre of world class architecture with flexible , adaptable 
and healthy buildings and a high quality of public realm for people to admire and 
18  
 
  
     
    
   
    
   
 
   
   
  
   
 
   
 
     
      
   
   
   
   
    
    
  
    
  
  
 
    
 
   
   
  
  
   
 
   
   
 
  
 
  
     
 
 
 enjoy . Further tall buildings will be encouraged where they can make a positive 
contribution to their surroundings and the skyline and provide for the hea lth and 
wellbeing of workers, adding to the tall building cluster in the east of the City. 
3.3.6. The City’s rich architectural and archaeological heritage will continue to be 
conserved and enhanced.  Historic buildings will be sympathetically adapted to 
new use s where this is appropriate , enabling them to play their part in meeting 
the needs of the future City.  New development will enhance the City’s character 
and add value to the wider character and quality of London, whilst respecting the 
setting , backdrop an d views of St Paul’s Cathedral and the Tower of London. 
3.3.7. Buildings, streets and spaces will be inclusive, interesting, legible and fit for 
purpose. Computer modelling, simulation and smart technology will be used to 
ensure that new buildings, and the space s between buildings, create an 
environment which attracts businesses and people from across the world. 
3.3.8. The City’s buildings, public realm and transport will be highly sustainable, 
designed to make efficient use of natural resources, minimise emissions and be 
resilient to natural and man -made threats. In partnership with public and private 
sector organisations the City will adopt new technologies to transition to a zero 
emission City by 2040, in line with the ambitions set out in the City Corporation’s 
Climate Action Strategy. 
3.3.9. The City will be a much greener place, with additional planting in and around 
new and existing buildings and the City’s streets and spaces, enhancing the 
environment , contributing to health and wellbeing and mitigating the impacts of 
pollution. New open and amenity spaces will be created including through the 
creation of new pedestrian routes, acces sible and permeable buildings, and the 
provision of amenity space at upper or roof levels. Public access to private open 
space will be encouraged. Biodiversity will be increased by the inclusion of 
wildlife -friendly features in new and existing open space s and buildings. 
3.3.10. The risk of flooding will be minimised by incorporating sustainable drainage 
into new developments and the public realm, alongside measures to reduce run -
off and increase rainwater recycling. The Thames Tideway Tunnel will be 
completed, greatly reducing storm discharges from the combined sewer system 
and improving the quality of the water in the River Thames. 
3.3.11. The City will become a Zero Waste City as developers , businesses and 
residents adopt Circular Economy principles and reduce the am ount of waste 
they produce whilst keeping resources in use for as long as possible. More 
flexible building designs will reduce the need for redevelopment of outdated 
office stock. Walbrook Wharf will continue to provide a facility for transferring 
material s, including waste, by river barge, thereby reducing lorry traffic in the 
City and across London. 
Strategic Objective: 
3.3.12. To shape the future City, ensuring that it is physically and virtually well 
connected , sustainable and responsive, resilient to natural and man -made

     threats, and delivers outstanding buildings, streets, public spaces, and heritage 
assets. 
3.4. Key Areas of Change 
The Vision…. 
Blackfriars 
3.4.1. Redevelopment or refurbishment of existing buildings will provide new high -
quality office and commercial accommodation with active ground floors within an 
improved public realm and environment that better reflects the status of the City. 
Easier access to t he riverside walk and a safer and more pleasant environment 
for all users, including pedestrians and cyclists, will be delivered. A new area of 
public realm at Blackfriars foreshore, created through the Thames Tideway 
project, will introduce greenery to th e riverside and provide a place for relaxation 
and recreation. 
Pool of London 
3.4.2. There is an opportunity to increase vibrancy and vitality in this area through 
greater use of the riverside walk, more leisure, retail and cultural public uses at 
ground level and the provision of publicly accessible roof terraces and spaces. 
Servicing of individual buildings will be improved through the introduction of 
shared servicing bays and access points. The area will be regenerated through 
the redevelopment or refurbishme nt of appropriate riverside sites. The public 
realm and accessibility will be significantly improved, contributing to an 
improvement in air quality. A higher quality pedestrian route will be created 
between London Bridge and the Tower of London creating a continuous 
attractive riverside walkway free of motorised traffic. Easier pedestrian access 
across Lower Thames Street will encourage more City workers, residents and 
visitors to enjoy the riverside. 
Aldgate , Tower and Portsoken 
3.4.3. Partnership working with t he London Borough of Tower Hamlets, businesses 
and residents will provide a framework for the delivery of improvements. 
Redevelopment and refurbishment will enhance the appearance and vibrancy of 
this area, with a mix of offices, residential, retail, commu nity and cultural 
facilities, catering for residents, workers, students and visitors. The open space 
at Aldgate Square will be the focal point of a high -quality public realm which 
provides better facilities for pedestrians and cyclists. Air quality will be improved 
particularly in proximity to The Aldgate School and the Middlesex Street and 
Mansell Street residential estates. Pedestrian connections, permeability and 
wayfinding will be improved, especially through large development sites and 
between Aldgate and Tower Gateway. Joint working with TfL and other transport 
operators will deliver improvements in public transport capacity to meet 
increasing demand.  Residents will have improved access to education, health, 
training and job opportunities relevant to their needs.

 City Cluster 
3.4.4. Office and employment growth will be successfully accommodated by a cluster 
of dynamic, attractive, sustainably designed and appropriately scaled tall 
buildings, providing an iconic view of the City and enhancing its role as a global 
hub for innovation in finance, professional services, commerce and culture. 
Complementary retail, leisure, cultural and educational facilities will support th e 
City’s primar y business function , principally thr ough animating ground floor 
spaces. Additional greening will be provided within and on buildings and in the 
public realm and air quality improved. An area wide approach will be taken to 
security and estate management to ensure the safety and comfort of wor kers 
and visitors, with a high -quality public realm and environment that reflects the 
status of the area. Freight and servicing deliveries will be reduced through off -
site consolidation , the re -timing of deliveries outside of peak hours and joint 
working w ith occupiers. Pedestrian movement and permeability will be improved 
with priority given to pedestrians through the reallocation of road space on key 
routes during daytime. Opportunities for cycling to, from and within the Cluster 
will be improved alongsid e measures to improve pedestrian access. Links to 
public transport nodes and other parts of the City, including to the Elizabeth Line 
at Liverpool Street Station, will be improved . 
Fleet St reet and Ludgate 
3.4.5. The role of Fleet Street as a centre for the judiciary and related business in the 
City will be enhanced by the potential development of a new court building and 
City of London Police Station. Partnership working with TfL will deliver safety 
improvements to the junction at Ludgate Circus. The role of Ludgate H ill as the 
primary approach to St Paul’s Cathedral will be enhanced. Existing office 
accommodation will be retained and improved to provide flexible floorspace and 
spaces to meet changing business needs. Public realm and transportation 
improvements will de liver a high quality environment which enhances the 
Principal Shopping Centre , the retail link and the historic lanes, alleyways, 
churchyards and spaces that lead off the processional route of Fleet Street and 
Ludgate Hill . Additional greening within the p ublic realm and on buildings , where 
appropriate, will deliver visual improvements and improvements in air quality. 
Residential development will be concentrated in lanes in and near identified 
residential areas and alleyways away from Fleet Street and Ludga te Hill to 
ensure a higher quality residential environment for residents. 
Smithfield and Barbican 
3.4.6. The Elizabeth Line will significantly enhance public transport accessibility in 
this part of the City. The Culture Mile initiative including relocation of the 
Museum of London to Smithfield and renewal of  the existing Barbican Centre 
will provide outstanding cultural facilities in landmark buildings. Beech Street will 
be transformed into a more welcoming environment, with significantly improved 
air quality, and the Beech Street/Long Lane axis will be the focus for a variety of 
retail units. The wider area will contain a broad mix of uses, including 
residential, office, retail, hotel, leisure and cultural, while temporary art and 
cultural installations will further animate the buildings and public realm. The 
growth of creative enterprise will be 
21  
 
    
 
   
 
   
 
 
    
   
 
 
  
 
   
  
      
   
    
   
    
  
 
   
 
 
  
  
   
  
   
    
  
  
 
   
  
    
     
 
   
 
 
  
  
   particularly supported in this area. The public realm will be enhanced with a 
distinctive look and feel, creating attractiv e streetscapes and vistas. Evening and 
night -time activities will expand and will be well -managed to protect residential 
amenity. Consolidation of the City Corporation’s wholesale markets onto a single 
site outside of the City will allow the re -use of Smit hfield Meat Market in whole or 
in part for other uses compatible with its heritage status and the City 
Corporation’s ambitions for Culture Mile. St Bartholomew’s Hospital will remain a 
major centre of health excellence. Additional greening, new open spaces and 
pedestrian and cycling priority in appropriate locations will reduce the potential 
for conflict between vehicular access to commercial and residential uses , 
allowing for more effective management of the increased numbers of 
pedestrians . 
Liverpool Street 
3.4.7. The area will be enhanced, taking advantage of improvements in public 
transport accessibility brought by the opening of the Elizabeth Line, and 
opportunities presented by the remodelling of Broadgate. Pedestrian routes will 
be enhanced, and active frontages provided at ground floor level to animate and 
add vibrancy to the area. Retail uses will be encouraged, and improvements 
delivered to the public realm around Liverpool Street Station. Additional greening 
will help to deliver air quality and biodiversity improvements. Office use will 
continue to be the predominant use but will provide more flexible and 
collaborative space to meet the needs of potential start -ups and allow for 
business growth. Collaborative working between businesses in thi s area, Tech 
City and creative industries within Culture Mile will create an attractive and 
vibrant business eco -system. 
Strategic Objective: 
3.4.8. To ensure that the challenges facing the Key Areas of Change are met, 
complementing the core business function of the City, supporting the 
development of its global business offer and world -class cultural , heritage and 
creative facilities and distinguishing the City from other global centres. 
3.5. The Spatial Strategy 
3.5.1. To deliver the City Corporation’s Vision and Strategic Objectives, a balance 
needs to be struck between the competing demands for further commercial and 
office growth, the rapidly growing workforce, the growing cultural and visitor 
economies and the needs and expectations of the City’s permanent residential 
population. An overarching imperative is to ensure that the City of London 
transitions to a zero carbon and zero emission City, improving air quality and 
delivering additional greening to the City’s buildings and spaces. 
3.5.2. The Local Plan will be implemented al ongside the policies and strategy of the 
London Plan , and particularly the London Plan’s principles of Good Growth. The 
City Plan 2036 Spatial Strategy and the detailed policies that follow set out how 
the balance between commercial, residential, cultural and environmental

    aspirations will be delivered and how the City of London will become a healthy , 
socially and economically inclusive City for all. 
3.5.3. Table 1 shows the scale of the projected growth in the main land uses in the 
City over the period 2016 to 2036. These projections pre -date the Covid -19 
pandemic but the fundamental advantages and principles underpinning growth 
in the City remain and, over the longer term life of this Plan to 2036, growth is 
expected in line with the projections.

professional services centre and to sustain the City’s strategically important 
cluster of commercial activities within the Central Activities Zone; 
3. Broadening the City’s appeal by ensuring new office developments deliver 
healthy working environments and meet the needs of different types of 
businesses, supporting specialist clusters such as legal and creative industries 
and promoting a range of complementary uses; 
4. Supporting the development of cultural facilities and uses and transforming the 
north west of the City into a vibrant strategic cultural area of national and 
international status through the Culture Mile initiative; 
5. Delivering at least 2,482 additional homes within the City by 20 35/36 to meet 
housing need and continuing to deliver new housing on City Corporation estates 
and other appropriate sites outside of the City; 
6. Focusing new tall buildings in the existing cluster in the east of the City, adding 
to the City’s distinctive and iconic skyline while preserving strategic and local 
views of St Paul’s Cathedral and the Tower of London World Heritage Site; 
7. Encouraging retail and other town centre uses that provide active frontages 
throughout the City, while focusing s ignificant retail development in the four 
Principal Shopping Centres; 
8. Identifying seven Key Areas of Change where significant change is expected in 
the period to 2036 and providing a policy framework to guide sustainable 
change in those areas; 
9. Balancing growth with the protection and enhancement of the City’s unique 
heritage assets and open spaces; 
10. Ensuring that development and infrastructure provision are compatible with the 
radical transformation of the City’s streets set out in the City’s Transport 
Strategy; 
11. Promoting greater use of the River Thames, regenerating and enhancing the 
City’s riverside and reducing the risk of flooding.

Contribute to a Flourishing Society 
4.1. Healthy and Inclusive City 
Context 
4.1.1. The City of London is a very densely built up area with a large daytime population 
and limited open space. The City’s economic success means there is a high level 
of construction activity, while the density of development and employment, delivery 
and servi cing requirements and the narrowness of many of the City’s streets all 
contribute to traffic congestion. This can result in poor air quality, noise and light 
pollution and a shortage of adequate open spaces, play and recreational spaces , 
impacting on t he health of residents, workers and visitors. 
4.1.2. The NPPF and the London Plan stress the importance of health and wellbeing 
and the role that the planning system can play in improving this. Planning can 
support strategies to improve health and cultural wellbeing and promot e healthy 
communities. Planning decisions can have an influence on people’s health, 
particularly through the design and management of new development. 
4.1.3. The City Corporation is committed to enabling a socially and economically 
inclusive environment in which nobody is disadvantaged. Everyone should have 
equal opportunities to access buildings, spaces, job and training opportunities and 
health, leisure and educational services. An inclusive environment is one that 
recognises that everyone b enefits from improved accessibility including disabled 
people, older people , families with children, carers, people with temporary medical 
conditions or impaired mobility and people who do not consider themselves 
disabled. An inclusive City allows all comm unities, irrespective of their social and 
economic position, to equally access the opportunities the City offers. This includes 
communities in neighbouring boroughs that should feel wel come to share in and 
contribute towards the City’s success. 
4.1.4. An importan t element of this commitment is breaking down unnecessary physical 
barriers and exclusions arising from the poor design of buildings and spaces. The 
needs of disabled people should be considered at an early stage of the planning 
process and not considered separately from the needs of others. 
4.1.5. A wide range of elements contribute to a healthy and inclusive environment. The 
transport and design policies in this Plan address relevant issues such as : Healthy 
Streets , active travel and permeability ; inclusive transport ; mitigating the impacts of 
pollution through the design of streets and public spaces ; and providing adequate 
shade and shelter . Green infrastructure policies highlight the benefits to health and 
wellbeing of open spaces and greenery wit hin the urban environment .

  Strategic Policy S 1: Healthy and Inclusive City 
The City Corporation will work with a range of partners to create a healthy and inclusive 
environment , promote social and economic inclusivity and enable all communities to 
access a wide range of health, education, recreation and leisure opportunities , by: 
1.Implementing the principles of the City of London Corporation Joint Health and
Wellbeing Strategy;
2.Ensuring that the construction, design, use and management of buildings and the
public realm helps to protect and improve the health of all the City’s communities;
3.Requiring Health Impact Assessments of different levels depending on the scale and
impact of th e proposed development;
4.Requiring the design and management of buildings, streets and spaces to provide for
the access needs of all the City’s communities, including the particular needs of
disabled people, older people and people with young children ;
5.Expe cting developers and development to:
•engage with neighbours before and during construction to minimise adverse
impacts;
•promote healthy buildings and the use of relevant standards that measure
health and well -being in buildings ;
•improve local air quality, particularly nitrogen dioxide and particulates PM10
and PM2.5;
•respect the City’s quieter places and spaces ;
•limit unnecessary light spillage and ‘sky glow’ ; and
•address land contamination, ensuring development does not result i n
contaminated land or pollution of the water environment.
6.Protecting and enhancing existing public health and educational facilities, including
St Bartholomew’s Hospital and existing City schools, working in partnership with
neighbouring boroughs to deliv er accessible additional educational and health
facilities in appropriate locations;
7.Encouraging the further provision of both public and private health facilities .
Conditions may be attached to permissions for public healthcare facilities to ensure
their future retention;
8.Promoting opportunities for training and skills development to improve access to
employment, particularly for City residents and those in neighbouring boroughs;
9.Supporting facilities for the provision and improvement of social and educati onal
services through the City’s libraries;
10.Supporting nursery provision and additional childcare facilities;

 11. Protecting and enhancing existing community facilities and providing new 
facilities where required; and 
12. Protecting and enhancing existing sport, play space and recreation facilities and 
encouraging the provision of further publicly accessible facilities , within major 
developments and public realm improvements . 
Reason for the policy 
4.1.6. The City Corporation’s Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy considers three 
distinct populations with different needs and health issues: residents, workers and 
rough sleepers.  Using data from the City and Hackney Joint Strategic Needs 
Assessment, it identi fies five priorities for health and wellbeing in the City: 
▪Good mental health for all; 
▪A healthy urban environment; 
▪Effective health and social care integration; 
▪All children have the best start in life; and 
▪Promoting healthy behaviours. 
4.1.7. The Local Plan has a particular role in delivering a healthy urban environment , as 
it can address issues such as poor air quality; relatively high levels of noise; a lack 
of green space, community space and space to exercise; some overcrowding of 
the housing stock; and road safety. The Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy notes 
there is strong evidence that the environment shapes wider health outcomes and it 
seeks to “ensure health and wellbeing issues are embedded into the Local Plan 
and major planning applications .” 
4.1.8. The C ity’s population differs from other areas in that the daytime population is 
dominated by workers, with residents forming a small but important community . 
The number of City employees and residents is forecast to increase during the 
Plan period, placing add itional demands on the provision of health, education and 
social services to the working and resident populations. City workers may find it 
difficult to access health services where they live due to their working hours and 
the provision of additional clinics and pharmacy services in the Square Mile could 
play an important role in addressing their health needs. 
4.1.9. The small permanent residential population in the City means that it is often not 
economic to deliver effective services for City res idents from locations within the 
City. The City Corporation therefore works jointly with neighbouring boroughs and 
service providers to ensure that cost effective services can be provided. For 
example, the City Corporation is working jointly with Islington to deliver the City of 
London Primary Academy Islington on a site which crosses the City/Islington 
boundary . The City Corporation will work with the City and Hackney Clinical 
Commissioning Group and other NHS and community organisations to regularly 
asses s the need for health and social care facilities locally and sub -regionally .

  Figure 5: Distribution of health facilities in and adjoining the City 
4.1.10. The City is intensively occupied with large numbers of people working in office 
buildings in close proximity . Many City employees work long hours and access 
leisure, medical and entertainment opportunities within or close to their place of 
employment. Research suggests that a poor working environment can have a 
negative impact on the health of workers, and conse quently their productivity. It is 
therefore important that buildings are designed to promote the health and wellbeing 
of everyone. 
4.1.11. Advances in technology and an awareness of how office environments can 
impact people’s mental and physical health has highli ghted the importance of 
striving to create a healthy City environment. A sense of community inclusion and 
belonging is important for both physical and mental health. People who live in 
cohesive communities with a wide range of employment opportunities, ser vices, 
infrastructure and low crime are less likely to suffer poor health. The City 
Corporation established the Business Healthy programme in 2017 to support 
businesses to promote the health and wellbeing of their employees. 
4.1.12. Outdoor spaces and the public realm are under increasing pressure to provide 
places for relaxation, amenity and flexible working. The location and nature of the 
City means that perceptions of tranquillity and quieter areas are often based on the 
relative noise levels of an area compared to its surroundings, rather than absolute 
noise levels. The City Corporation’s Noise Strategy 2016 -2026 supports the 
creation of tranquil areas in the City and promotes awareness of the importance of 
protecting and enhancing these locations where possible. Examples of quieter 
30  
 
   
   
 
   
  
 
  
    
 
     
   
 
 
            areas in the City are open spaces, parts of the Riverside Walk, churchyards a nd 
housing estates. Research on traffic noise has found that long -term exposure to 
noise above a certain level can have negative impacts on physical and mental 
health. It is therefore important to p rotect the relative tranquillity of some of the 
City’s op en spaces to confer benefits to health and wellbeing by providing places of 
respite from the City’s generally high ambient noise levels. 
4.1.13. The City is a relatively affluent area and is the third least deprived local authority 
area in London. However, dispar ities exist. While the Barbican is amongst the 20% 
least deprived residential areas in England, Mansell Street and Petticoat Lane 
areas are amongst the 40% most deprived. The Local Plan can play a part in 
tackling such disparities, for instance by securin g training and skills programmes 
through planning obligations associated with major development schemes.

  How the policy works 
4.1.14. To protect and enhance people’s physical and mental health, new development 
should be designed to promote physical activity and well -being, through 
appropriate arrangements of buildings and uses, access, increased green 
infrastructure , and the provision of facilities to support walking and cycli ng. This 
could include the provision of land or spaces for food growing , which can help 
promote a more active lifestyle , improve social cohesion and mental and physical 
health and well -being. 
4.1.15. To facilitate the delivery of a healthy city, developers should engage with 
neighbours before and during construction to ensure impacts on the amenity of 
neighbours can be minimised. 
4.1.16. Developers are encouraged to use established assessment methodologies to 
ensure that development contributes towards a healthy city . There are several 
accreditation system s that attempt to measure the health and well -being elements 
of building design, construction and operation and how these features impact on 
health and wellbeing. 
4.1.17. Major commercial developments should seek to reach outwards into the 
community by providing services and facilitie s which can benefit wider health and 
contribute to ambitions to reduce single use plastics and other waste through the 
use of public drinking fountains , as well as providing defibrillators and publicly 
accessible toilets , for example through membership of the Community Toilet 
Scheme . Signage at the front of buildings should be displayed to make the publi c 
aware of the availability of these facilities. 
4.1.18. Major commercial developments are also encouraged to provide space which 
can be used for community needs such as public health facilities, community, 
cultural or sporting activities. The adequate provision of floorspace for these 
activities is vital for the health and well -being of the City’s communities. Such 
space could be made available at an affordable rent and be accessible from street 
level independently from commercial operations. 
4.1.19. Changes to the Use Classes Order introduced in September 2020 have included 
certain health and medical services such as clinics, health centres, creches, day 
nurseries and day centres within the new Use Class E. This means that such uses 
could be converted to a range of other Class E commercial, business and service 
uses without planning permission. Given the limited opportunities to replace such 
facilities in the City, conditions may be attached to permissions for new public 
health facilities to ensure that the impacts o f any proposed later conversion to 
another use can be considered through the planning application process. 
Conditions will not be applied to private healthcare facilities.

  Policy HL1: Inclusive buildings and spaces 
Buildings , open spaces and streets must meet the highest standards of accessibility and 
inclusive design, ensuring that the City of London is: 
inclusive and safe for all, regardless of disability, age, gender, ethnicity, faith or 
economic circumstance ; 
convenient and welcoming with no disabling barriers, ensuring that everyone can 
experience independence without undue effort, separation or special treatment; 
responsive to the needs of all users who visit, work or live in the City, whilst 
recognising that one solution might not work for all. 
Reas on for the policy 
4.1.20. The built environment needs to be safe, accessible and convenient to improve 
the quality of life for all City users and particularly for disabled and elderly people 
and those with other mobility difficulties. Despite progress in building a more 
accessible City, some people still experience considerable barriers to living 
independent and dignified lives as a result of the way the built environment is 
designed, built and managed. The outcome of embracing inclusive design should 
be a City whe re people want to live, work and visit and which feels open and 
welcoming to people from different backgrounds . 
How the policy works 
4.1.21. Developers will be required to submit Design and Access Statements which 
demonstrate a commitment to inclusive design and engagement with relevant user 
groups , including health and social care providers . Such engagement should take 
place at the detailed design stage prior to submission of an application to ensure 
maximum effectiveness and inclusive design within the building and in the 
surrounding public realm . Design and Access Statements must include details both 
on how best practice standards have been complied with and how inclusion will be 
maintained and managed throughout the lifetime of the building. 
Policy HL2: Air quality 
1.Developers will be required to effectively manage the impact of their proposals on air
quality . Major developments must provide an Air Quality Impact Assessment;
2.Development that would result in a worsening of the City’s nitrogen dioxide or PM 10
and PM 2.5 pollution levels will be strongly resisted ;
3.All developments must be at least Air Quality Neutral . Developments subject to an
Environmental Impact Assessment should adopt an air quality positive approach
wherever possible .  Major developments must maximise credits for the pollution
section of the BREEAM assessment relating to on -site emissions of oxides of
nitrogen (NOx);
33  
 
      
  
   
      
  
   
 
   
      
 
   
    
   
 
    
 
  
 
  
      
   
 
    
 
   
  
    
   
   
  
 
  
 
  
  
   
  
    
  
   
     
    4.Developers will be expected to install non -combustion energy technology where
available ;
5.A detailed A ir Quality Impact Assessment will be required for combustion based low
carbon technologies (e.g. biomass, combined heat and power) , and any necessary
mitigation must be approved by the City Corporation;
6.Developments that include uses that are more vulnerab le to air pollution, such as
schools, nurseries, medical facilities and residential development, will be refused if
the occupants would be exposed to poor air quality . Developments will need to
ensure acceptable air quality through appropriate design, layout, landscaping and
technological solutions;
7.Construction and deconstruction and the transport of construction materials and
waste must be carried out in such a way as to minimise air quality impacts to the
fullest extent possible. Impacts from these activ ities must be addressed within
submitted Air Quality Impact Assessments ;
8.Air intake points should be located away from existing and potential pollution sources
(e.g. busy roads and combustion flues). All combustion flues should terminate above
the roof hei ght of the tallest part of the development to ensure maximum dispersion
of pollutants .
Reason for the policy 
4.1.22. Due to its location at the heart of London and the density of development, the 
City of London has high levels of air pollution. Poor air quality can harm human 
health, particularly for young people while their lungs are developing, and increase 
the inciden ce of cardiovascular and lung disease. The City, in common with all 
central London, has been declared an Air Quality Management Area, d ue to 
national health -based objectives for the pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and small 
particles (PM 10) not being met . 
4.1.23. The City Corporation is working with a wide range of organisations to address 
this problem and levels of NO 2 are falling, although the health -based limits are still 
not met everywhere in the Square Mile. The City Corporation ’s Air Quality Strategy 
aims to ensure that air quality in over 90% of the Square Mile meets the health -
based Limit Values and World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines for NO 2 by 
the beginning of 2025. Limits set in European Directives for particulate matter 
(PM 10 and PM 2.5) are gen erally met in the City, except adjacent to the busiest 
roadsides in unfavourable weather conditions. However, the WHO has identified 
health impacts even at very low concentrations. The Air Quality Strategy aims to 
support the Mayor of London to meet the ti ghter WHO Guidelines for PM 10 and 
PM 2.5 by 2030. 
4.1.24. The City Corporation ’s Transport Strategy contains proposals to reduce air 
pollution associated with road traffic in the Square Mile , including the introduction 
of local Zero Emission Zones covering Barbican and Golden Lane and the City 
Cluster by 2022. An interim two-way Zero Emission Street at Beech Street will be 
implemented in 202 0. While t he main source of pollutants in the City has 
34  
 
      
   
 
       
 
   
 
   
  
  
    
    
  
 
  
   
   
 
   
    
   
     
      
     
  
  
    
     
   
  
 
 
   
   
  
   
  
    
 
    
   
   
 
 historically been road transport , following implementation of the Mayor’s Ultra Low 
Emission Zone in 2019 it is forecast that a greater share of remaining air pollutants 
will be generated by buildings. It is predicted that by 2020 buildings will account for 
over half of NO 2 emissions arising in the City. Tackling poor air quality requires a 
broad range of actions, including reducing traffic cong estion and supporting low 
emissions vehicles, reducing emissions associated with combustion -based heating 
and cooling systems, and limiting emissions linked with demolition and 
construction. The addition of green space and planting on and around buildings 
and within the public realm can help to trap particulate pollution. 
How the policy works 
4.1.25. The City Corporation’s Air Quality Strategy provides detailed information on the 
air quality issues facing the City and actions being pursued by the City Corporation 
and a range of partners to improve air quality. The Air Quality SPD sets out specific 
guidance for developers on the City Corporation’s requirements for reducing air 
pollution from developments within the Square Mile. The City Corporation ’s Code 
of Practice for Deconstruction and Construction Sites and the Mayor’s Control of 
Dust and Emissions during Construction and Demolition SPG provide guidance on 
procedures to be adopted to minimise the impacts of demolition and construction 
activities on air qu ality. 
4.1.26. Developers will be required to manage the impact of their proposals on air 
quality , which should as a minimum be air quality neutral . Large -scale 
developments that are subject to Environmental Impact Assessment procedures 
should , in particular, propose methods of delivering an air quality positive approach 
which results in improvements to the City’s air quality . The Mayor of London 
intends to produce guidance to inform the preparation of statements for 
developments taking an air quality positive appr oach. 
Policy HL3: Noise and light pollution 
1. Developers must consider the noise and lighting impact s of their development . 
2. Internal and external lighting should be designed to reduce energy consumption, 
avoid spillage of light beyond where it is needed and protect the amenity of light -
sensitive uses such as housing, hospitals and areas of importance for nature 
conservation. 
3. A noise assessment will be required where there may be an impact on noise -
sensitive uses. The layout, orientation, design and use of buildings should ensure 
that operational noise does not adversely affect nearby land uses , particularly noise -
sensitive land uses such as housing, hospitals, schools, nurseries and quiet open 
spaces. 
4. Any potential noise or light pollution conflict s between existing activities and new 
development should be minimised. New development must include suitable 
mitigation measures such as attenuation of noise or light spillage or restrictions on 
operating hours. 
35  
 
    
    
 
  
  
  
   
 
  
 
  
  
 
    
    
  
 
   
  
    
 
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
     
 
 
  
   
   
     
    
  
 
 
 5. Noise and vibra tion from deconstruction and construction activities must be 
minimised and mitigation measures put in place to limit noise disturbance near the 
development. 
6. Developers will be required to demonstrate that there will be no increase in 
background noise level s associated with new plant and equipment. 
7. Opportunities will be sou ght to incorporate improvements to the acoustic environment 
and existing lighting schemes within major development. 
Reason for the policy 
4.1.27. The City has a complex, densely developed and intensively used built 
environment in which space is at a premium and where multiple activities occur in 
very close proximity. Therefore, the effective management of noise and light 
pollution impacts applies to both development that introduces new sources of noise 
and light pollution and development that is sensitive to noise and light pollution. 
4.1.28. Careful planning and design are required to ensure proper consideration of key 
issues where lighting has an impact s uch as movement, safety, security as well as 
the reduction of energy use and light pollution. Light pollution is a particular 
problem where large commercial buildings have lights on during the night, which 
can impact residential amenity. 
4.1.29. The main noise and vibration sources related to new developments in the City 
are: 
• Construction and demolition work and associated activities, such as piling, 
heavy goods vehicle movements and street works; 
• Building services plant and equipment, such as ventilation fans, ai r-
conditioning and emergency generators; 
• Leisure facilities and licensed premises, involving noise from people and 
amplified music; and 
• Servicing activities such as deliveries, window cleaning and building 
maintenance. 
4.1.30. Noise and light sensitive uses and developments in the City include residential 
developments (including hotels and serviced apartments), health facilities, schools 
and childcare provision and certain open spaces. 
4.1.31. Planning and licensing regimes operate under separate legislative and 
regulatory frameworks. The City Corporation will ensure that, as far as is possible, 
a complementary approach is taken between planning and licensing to enable 
consistency of advice and decision making. Policy CV4: Evening and Night -Time 
Economy sets out the plannin g policy approach to evening and night -time 
entertainment uses in the Square Mile. 
36  
 
   
   
   
   
   
  
   
 
  
    
    
  
  
 
     
 
   
  
  
    
    
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
     
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
 How the policy works 
4.1.32. The City of London Noise Strategy 2016 -2026 sets out the strategic approach to 
noise in the City and the City Corporation ’s Code of Practice for Deconstruction 
and Construction Sites provides guidance on procedures to be adopted to minimise 
the noise and vibration impacts of development. The use of planning conditions or 
obligations will be considered where this could successfully moderate adverse 
effects, for example, by limiting hours of operation. 
4.1.33. When bringing forward major development proposals, developers are 
encouraged to consider whether there may be opportunities to enhance the 
existing acoustic environment, for instance by incorporating wa ter features that can 
aid relaxation and help to mask traffic noise. More information about this can be 
found in the City Corporation ’s Noise Strategy. 
4.1.34. For noise sensitive developments, confirmation will be sought of appropriate 
acoustic standards at the d esign stage. The City Corporation will apply the ‘agent 
of change’ principle, meaning that the responsibility for mitigating the impact of 
noise will fall on the new development. 
4.1.35. The City Corporation has adopted a Lighting Strategy, which includes a range of 
proposals to improve the quality of lighting across the City with specific 
recommendations for different character areas. The Lighting Strategy includes 
guidelines to help reduce light spillage and glare from retail and office premises, 
and from signage . The redevelopment or refurbishment of buildings may present 
opportunities to reduce the impacts of existing insensitive lighting schemes. 
Lighting proposals should take account of impacts on biodiversity and should be 
designed to ensure an appropriate habitat to improve biodiversity in the City. 
Particular attention should be paid to the impact of lighting on the City’s bat 
population . 
Polic y HL4: Contaminated land and water quality 
Where development involves ground works or the creation of open spaces, developers 
will be expected to carry out a detailed site investigation to establish whether the site is 
contaminated and to determine the potential for pollution of the water environment or 
harm to human health and non -human receptors.  Suitable mi tigation must be identified 
to remediate any contaminated land and prevent potential adverse impacts of the 
development on human and non -human receptors, land or water quality. 
Reason for the policy 
4.1.36. When a site is developed, and ground conditions change th ere is potential for 
contaminants to be mobilised, increasing the risk of harm.  Site investigation should 
establish whether the proposed use is compatible with the land condition. The term 
“non-human receptors ” encompasses buildings and other property, or ecological 
systems and habitats, which may be harmed as a result of contaminated land or 
water.

 How the policy works 
4.1.37. Pre-application discussions will be used to identify the particular issues related 
to environmental protection that are relevant to each d evelopment site.  The City 
Corporation has published a Contaminated Land Strategy and a Contaminated 
Land Inspection Strategy, which provide details of the issues likely to be 
encountered in different parts of the City and should be used for reference by 
developers. 
Policy HL5: Location and protection of social and community facilities 
1. Existing social and community facilities will be protected in situ unless: 
• replacement facilities are provided on -site or within the vicinity which meet the 
needs of the users of the existing facility; or 
• necessary services can be delivered from other facilities without leading to, or 
increasing, any shortfall in provision; or 
• it has been demonstrated through active marketing, at reasonable terms for 
public, social and community floorspace, that there is no demand for the 
existing facility or another social or community use on the site. 
2. The development of new social and communit y facilities should provide flexible, 
multi -use space s suitable for a range of different uses and will be permitted: 
• where they would not be prejudicial to the business City and where there is no 
strong economic reason for retaining office use; 
• in locati ons which are convenient to the communities they serve; 
• in or near identified residential areas, providing their amenity is safeguarded; 
and 
• as part of major mixed -use developments, subject to an assessment of the 
scale, character, location and impact of the proposal on existing facilities and 
neighbouring uses. 
3. Developments that result in additional need for social and community facilities will 
be required to provide the necessary facilities or contribute towards enhancing 
existing facilities to enable them to meet identified need. 
Reason for the policy 
4.1.38. Social and community facilities contribute to successful communities by 
providing venues for a wide range of activities and services. As such they make a 
significant contribution to people’s mental , spiritual and physical well -being, sense 
of community, learning and education. Library and educational facilities and those 
that support th e City’s business and cultural roles are particularly important. A 
definition of social and community facilities, with reference to the Use Classes 
Order, is provided in the glossary.

 How the policy works 
4.1.39. Existing social and community facilities will be pr otected in situ , unless it can be 
demonstrated to the City Corporation’s satisfaction that there is no demand from 
social and community users for the facilities or that their loss is part of a published 
asset management plan, in the case of non -commercial enterprises , or that 
necessary services can be delivered from alternative premises without a reduction 
in service provision . The presumption is that current facilities and uses should be 
retained where a continuing need exists. If this is not feasible, pre ference will be 
given to another social and community use in the first instance. 
4.1.40. Where existing social and community facilities are to be relocated, the 
replacement facilities should be within the City. However, for services that serve a 
wider catchment ar ea, relocation outside the City, but within a reasonable distance, 
may be acceptable. There may be advantages in locating organisations together 
within multi -functional community buildings to maximise the efficient use of 
resources . For example, the Artizan Street Library hosts community meeting 
rooms , play groups and exercise classes as well as traditional library facilities . 
Places of worship have the potential to accommodate a range of activities on their 
premises which can help improve community c ohesion. Relocated facilities must 
be available to communities at a cost/rent equivalent to that charged prior to 
redevelopment. New facilities provided should similarly provide space at a cost/rent 
that is affordable to the communities being served. 
4.1.41. Where rationalisation of services would result in either the reduction or 
relocation of social and community floorspace, the replacement floorspace must be 
of a comparable size or provide a better quality of service to target communities . 
Policy HL6: Publi c toilets 
The City Corporation will promote a widespread distribution of public ly accessible toilets 
which meet public demand by: 
• requiring the provision of a range of directly accessible public toilet facilities in 
major retail , leisure and transport developments, particularly near visitor 
attractions, public open spaces and existing major transport interchanges. 
Provision should be made for disabled people and their carers (changing 
places toilets). Public ly accessible toilets should be avai lable during normal 
opening hours, or 24 hours a day in suitable areas with concentrations of 
night -time activity; 
• supporting an increase in the membership of the Community Toilet Scheme; 
• resisting the loss of existing publicly accessible toilets as a res ult of 
redevelopment , and requiring the provision of replacement facilities, unless 
adequate provision is available nearby; and 
• requiring the renewal of existing toilets which are within areas subject to major 
redevelopment schemes and seeking the incorpor ation of additional toilets in 
proposed developments where they are needed to meet increased demand.

40Reason for the policy 
4.1.42. Inclusive and accessible toilet provision is essential to meet the needs of all 
communities. Public ly accessible toilets are a parti cularly important facility for a 
number of groups, such as the elderly, those with disabilities, people with babies 
and young children , pregnant women and others with chronic illnesses . They are 
also important to meet the needs of tourists and visitors to the City . It is important 
when designing toilet provision to include cubicles for people with ambulant 
mobility impairments which can also be suitable for some older people and people 
who require additional space. 
4.1.43. Areas of the City with concentrations of night -time entertainment require 
adequate publicly accessible toilet provision to prevent fouling o n the streets. 
How the policy works 
4.1.44. The City Corporation will require the provision of publicly accessible toilets in 
major retail , leisure , transport and commercial development s, secured through 
legal agreements , or through encouraging membership of the Community Toilet 
Scheme. The Community Toilet Scheme allows the public to use toilet facilities in 
participating businesses , albeit that hours are often restricted . 
4.1.45. Public ly accessible toilets should be clearly signposted to ensure they are easily 
found.  The City Corporation has produced a free toilet finder app suitable for use 
on mobile phones. Facilities should be maintained by the own er as part of the 
overall maintenance of any development. 
4.1.46. ‘Changing places’ toilets are not designed for independent use and should be 
provided in addition to standard unisex disabled persons’ toilets, baby change and 
family facilities, rather than as a replacement. Where publicly accessible toilets are 
provided, consideration should be given to the provision of self -contained gender -
neutral toilets. 
Policy HL7: Sport and recreation 
Existing public sport and recreational facilities will be protected in situ, unless: 
• replacement facilities are provided on -site or within the vicinity that meets the 
needs of the users of that facility; or 
• necessary services can be delivered from other facilities without leading to, or 
increasing, any shortfall in provision; or 
• it has been demonstrated through active marketing, at reasonable terms for 
sport and recreational use, that there is no demand for the existing faci lity or 
alternative sport and recreation facilities which could be met on the site. 
2. The provision of new sport and recreation facilities , parti cularly publicly accessible 
facilities, will be encouraged: 
• where they provide flexible space to accommodate a range of different 
uses/users and are accessible to all;  
 
    
 
  
   
   
  
   
   
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
   
     
    
   
 
     
  
  
  
  
 
  
   
 
 
    
    
  
        
    
  
 
  
 
 
 • in locations which are convenien t to the communities they serve, including 
open spaces; 
• near existing residential areas; 
• as part of major developments subject to an assessment of the scale, 
character, location and impact of the proposal on existing facilities and 
neighbouring uses; and 
• where they will not cause undue disturbance to neighbouring occupiers. 
3. The use of vacant development sites for a temporary sport or recreational use will be 
encouraged where appropriate and where this does not preclude return to the 
original use or other suitable use on redevelopment. 
Reason for the policy 
4.1.47. There has been an increase in sport and recreational facilities in the City in 
recent years, with much of the increase resulting from additional private gym 
facilities within office developments a nd some hotels. The rapid growth in the 
working population, as well as the increasing recognition of the importance of 
healthy lifestyles, means there is a continued demand for these facilities. 
How the policy works 
4.1.48. The City Corporation will protect existi ng public sports and recreation facilities in 
situ, where there is a need, and encourage the provision of new public and private 
facilities. Where in situ provision is not feasible, services should be delivered from 
other facilities without reducing the le vel of provision . However, any proposals 
involving the loss of public sport and recreational facilities must be accompanied by 
evidence of a lack of need for those facilities. Current public facilities and uses 
should be retained where a continuing need exists. If this is not feasible, 
preference will be given to a similar type of sport and recreational use in the first 
instance. 
4.1.49. The loss of private facilities such as gyms through redevelopm ent or change of 
use will be permitted where the replacement uses meet other objectives in this 
Plan. Following c hanges to the Use Classes Order introduced in September 2020, 
existing gyms and other indoor recreational uses could be converted to a range of 
alternative Class E commercial, business and service uses without planning 
permission, unless there are specific planning conditions attached to a site which 
prevent this. 
4.1.50. Open spaces and publicly accessible rooftops can provide valuable formal or 
informa l sports and recreation al facilities in the densely built City environment . An 
imaginative approach to multi-purpose structures in outdoor spaces can allow 
seating and other street furniture to be designed to also facilitate physical activities 
that promot e health and fitness , such as stretching , sit ups and markers for walking 
and running distances. Outdoor exercise is beneficial but those exercising need to 
mindful of the safety of others and the busy city centre context.

 Policy HL8: Play areas and facilities 
The City Corporation will protect existing play provision and seek additional or 
enhanced play facilities or space, particularly in areas where a need has been 
identified, by: 
• protecting existing play areas and facilities and, on redevelopment, requiring 
the replacement of facilities either on -site or nearby to an equivalent or better 
standard; 
• requiring external play space and facilities as part of major new residential 
developments; 
• where the creation of new play facilities is not possible , requiring developers to 
work with the City Corporation to deliver enhanced provision nearby , or 
provide financial contributions to enable the provision of facilities elsewhere ; 
and 
• promoting opportunities for informal play within open spaces where it is not 
possible to secure formal play areas. 
2. Play areas and facilities must be inclusive and not be located in areas of poor air 
quality due to the negative health impacts on young children. 
Reason for the policy 
4.1.51. Play is essential for the healthy development of children and takes place in both 
formal and informal spaces. Formal play spaces include areas specifically 
designed and designated for play. 
How the policy works 
4.1.52. The high rate of development in the City and the creation of new, and 
improvement of existing, public realm creates opportunities for informal play 
spaces in the City, which are not designated solely for that purpose but contain 
features that can be used for imaginative play. These spaces would a lso benefit 
the increasing numbers of children who visit the City. 
4.1.53. Public realm improvements and the creation of new open spaces should be 
designed imaginatively to serve the needs of workers but also offer informal play 
opportunities. Where the opportuni ty arises , the City Corporation will enable 
appropriate sensory play areas in the City for children , young people and adults 
with special educational needs and disabilities .

 Policy H L9: Health Impact Assessment (HIA) 
The City Corporation will require d evelopment to deliver health benefits to the City’s 
communities and mitigate any negative impacts by: 
1. requiring all major development, and developments where potential health issues 
are likely to arise, to submit a Health y City Planning Checklist; and 
2. requiring a Rapid or Full HIA to be submitted for larger -scale development proposals. 
The scope of any HIA should be agreed with the City Corporation and be informed by 
City Corporation guidance on HIA. The assessment sho uld be undertaken as early as 
possible in the development process so that potential health gains can be maximised, 
and any negative impacts can be mitigated. 
Reason for the policy 
4.1.54. The City of London is a densely built up central urban location. The scale of 
development, the busy and congested streets and pavements, limited open space 
and large numbers of workers can impact on people’s physical and mental health. 
4.1.55. Major development ca n impact on health in a variety of ways including through 
noise and pollution during the construction phrase, increased traffic movements 
and greater competition for limited open space. Equally, development can deliver 
improvements such as improved access by walking, cycling and public transport 
and the provision of opportunities to access open and green space s, exercise 
facilities, cultural and community facilities and healthy food outlets. 
4.1.56. HIAs provide a systematic framework to identify the potential impa cts of a 
development proposal on the health and wellbeing of the population and highlight 
any health inequalities that may arise. The Covid -19 pandemic has highlighted the 
important role that health impact assessments can play in enabling developers to 
understand and plan for potential risks to health and wellbeing. 
4.1.57. HIAs can highlight mitigation measures that may be appropriate to enable 
developments to maximise the health of communities. 
How the policy works 
4.1.58. Developers will be expected to identify potenti al impacts on health resulting from 
all major developments in the City. To assist this process, the City Corporation will 
publish guidance based on the NHS London Healthy Urban Development Unit’s 
(HUDUs) HIA methodology but adapted to address City specific issues. 
4.1.59. In line with the Mayor of London’s Social Infrastructure SPG, the level of HIA 
required will depend upon the scale and impact of the development . 
43  
 
  
 
    
  
 
   
   
      
   
  
 
    
  
 
 
 
   
  
   
  
 
 
 
    
    
  
   
 
 
  
  
  
   
   
 Desktop assessment 
4.1.60. This draws on existing knowledge and evidence, often using published 
checklists which provide a broad overview of potential health impacts. The City 
Corporation will prepare a Healthy City Planning checklist for this purpose, which 
will incorporate relevant elements of TfL’s Healthy Streets Check to ensure that 
land-use and transport impacts on health are considered in a coordinated way. 
4.1.61. The Healthy City Planning checklist should be submitted with planning 
applications for developments of between 10 and 99 dwellings or between 1,000m2 
– 9,999m2 of commercial floorspace. It w ill also be required for developments 
considered to have particular health impacts, including those involving sensitive 
uses such as education, health, leisure or community facilities, publicly accessible 
open space, hot food take away shops, betting shops and in areas where air 
pollution and noise issues are particularly prevalent. 
Rapid HIA 
4.1.62. This would require a more focused investigation of health impacts which would 
normally recommend mitigation and/or enhancement measures. The City 
Corporation will adapt the London HUDU Rapid HIA Tool to reflect the City’s 
circumstances and will expect this to be used for developments of 10,000m2 or 
greater commercial floorspace or 100 or more residential units. 
Full HIA 
4.1.63. This involves comprehensive analysis of all potential health and wellbeing 
impacts, which may include quantitative and qualitative information, data from 
health needs assessments, reviews of the evidence base and community 
engagement. A full HIA will be required on those development s that are subject to 
an Environmental Impact Assessment and could be included within the 
Environmental Statement to avoid duplication. 
4.1.64. HIAs must look at the issue of health comprehensively, and not focus solely on 
access to health services. Where signifi cant impacts are identified, measures to 
mitigate the adverse impact of the development should be provided as part of the 
proposals or secured through conditions or a Section 106 Agreement.

 4.2. Safe and Secure City 
Context 
4.2.1. The City is a safe place to live, work and visit, with low rates of crime. The 
continuing security and safety of the City is key to its success, whether as a base 
for a company, a place to live or somewhere to spend leisure time. As a world 
leading financial and professional services centre, addressing potential risks from 
fraud, terrorism and cyber crime is of critical importance . 
4.2.2. The City of London has its own police force , which enables it to focus on the 
City’s specific circumstances while playing a leading national role in combatting 
economic and cyber crime. The City of London Police publish a three -year Policing 
Plan, updated annually, which sets out priorities that address both its national and 
local obligations . Current priorities are : 
• Counter te rrorism; 
• Cyber crime; 
• Fraud; 
• Vulnerable people; 
• Roads policing; 
• Public order; 
• Violent and acquisitive crime ; 
• Antisocial behaviour . 
4.2.3. The Safer City Partnership brings together representatives from both statutory 
and non -statutory agencies that contribute to the work of keeping the City safe. The 
Partnership ’s vision is for the City of London to be a safe place to live, learn, work , 
and visit. The Partnership meet s regularly and publishes a Strategic Plan , which 
identifies the following outcomes for 2019 -2022: 
• Vulnerable people and communities are protected and s afeguarded ; 
• People are safe from violent crime and violence against the person; 
• People and businesses a re protected from theft and fraud/acquisitive crime; 
• Anti-Social Behaviour is tackled and responded to effectively; 
• People are safe and feel safe in the Night -Time Economy. 
4.2.4. The Secure City programme is a joint initiative between the City Corporation and 
City of London Police , intended to deliver significant improvements to the safety of 
residents, workers and visitors. Drawing on the success of historic approaches to 
security and the latest examples of best practice from cities across the world, the 
programme will future -proof security arrangements to meet emerging challenges 
such as protect ing new crowded spaces. The programme will integrate with other

      initiatives including Smart City technology and Culture Mile and will align with this 
Plan and the City Corporation’s Transport Strategy. 
4.2.5. The City is home to the Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey , the Rolls 
Building court complex, the Mayor's and City of London Court , the C ity of London 
Magistrate’s Court and The Inner and Middle Temples Inns of Court , together with 
a number of legal firms . 
Strategic Policy S 2: Safe and Secure City 
The City Corporation will work with the City of London Police and the London Fire 
Brigade to ensure that the City is secure from crime, disorder and terrorism, and is able 
to accommodate large numbers of people safely and efficiently by: 
1. Minimising the potential for crime and anti -social behaviour by ensuring that 
development proposals design out crime and encouraging a mix of uses and natural 
surveillance of streets and spaces; 
2. Implementing measures to enhance the collective security of the City against terrorist 
threats, applying security measures to broad ar eas such as the Traffic and 
Environmental Zone, major development schemes, or to the City as a whole; 
3. Developing area -based approaches to implementing security measures where major 
developments are planned or are under construction simultaneously, and in locations 
where occupiers have requested collective security measures; 
4. Ensuring that development proposals take account of the need for resilience so that 
residential and business communities are better prepared for, and better able to 
recover from , emerg encies (including the promotion of business continuity 
measures) ; 
5. Requiring development proposals to meet the highest standards of fire safety. Major 
development proposals must prepare and submit a Fire Statement setting out how 
the development will address fire safety in the design, construction and operation of 
the building. 
Reason for the policy 
4.2.6. Safety and security are important to the continuing role of the City of London as a 
world leading financial and professional services centre, a nd as an att ractive place 
to live and visit. Ensuring a safe and secure City requires close co -operation 
between the City Corporation , the City of London Police and the London Fire 
Brigade , and between these agencies , the Metropolitan Police, the British 
Transport Pol ice, the Government and Judiciary and the Mayor of London. Close 
working with developers and occupiers is also essential. 
How the policy works 
4.2.7. Security and fire safety features should be considered at the outset of the design 
process to be most effective and avoid the need for retrofitting later during the 
46  
 
   
   
 
    
   
   
  
  
        
 
     
  
  
  
   
   
   
   
    
 
   
   
 
    
  
   
   
  
  
     
   
  
  
  
   
 
  
  
    
 
 
 
 development process or following completion. Early engagement with the City 
Corporation , the City of London Police and the London Fire Brigade is particularly 
important , including th rough the pre -application process . 
4.2.8. The design of a scheme should create safe and accessible environments where 
crime and disorder, and the fear of crime do not undermine quality of life or social 
cohesion. Designs should take into account the most up -to-date information and 
advice regarding security needs in the area, working with local advisors to reduce 
vulnerability and increase resilience. Where appropriate, developers will b e 
required to contribute towards the funding of measures designed to enhance 
security . 
4.2.9. All development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and 
developers must liaise at an early stage in the design process with the City 
Corporation’s District Surveyor and the London Fire Brigade on fire safety 
considerations , incorporating London Plan fire safety requirements . Major 
development proposals must be accompanied by a Fire Statement which sets out 
how the development will address fire safety in the design, construction and 
operation of the building. 
Policy SA1: Crowded Places 
All major developments are required to address the issue of crowded places and 
counter -terrorism by: 
• Conducting a full risk assessment; 
• Undertaking early consultation with the City of London Police on risk mitigation 
measures; 
• Restricting or rationalising motor vehicle access where required; and 
• Ensuring that public realm and pedestrian permeability is not adversely 
impacted, and that the design of the development considers the application of 
Hostile Vehicle Mitigation measures at an early stage. 
Reason for the policy 
4.2.10. Places that are attractive, open and easily accessible can often become 
crowded. Such places are a potential target for crime and terrorism and offer the 
prospect of serious disruption or worse. 
4.2.11. Crowded places include mainline and underground stations, shopping centres, 
bars and clubs which are all easily accessible. The high density of development, 
the substantial daytime population and the high -profile of many City buildings and 
businesses make the area a potential target for terrorism. 
4.2.12. Measures such as traffic calming may be employed to limit the opportunity for 
hostile vehicle approach. Other measures that have been taken in the City include 
the City of London Traffic and Environmental Zone, w hich is the security and 
surveillance cordon that surrounds the Square Mile. It consists of road barriers, 
checkpoints and closed -circuit television cameras with the aim of slowing, 
47  
 
    
   
   
 
   
 
  
   
    
  
    
  
   
   
    
 
  
 
  
 
    
    
   
 
  
    
   
 
   
  
   
  
     
 
 
 
  
     
 
 
 
   managing and monitoring vehicular movements entering the City. In 2016, th e City 
Corporation also approved an Anti -Terrorism Traffic Regulation Order (ATTRO), a 
counter -terrorism measure that allows the City of London Police to close routes at 
certain times, specified in the order, and divert vehicles away from the area to deal 
with identified threats. Its purpose is to avoid or reduce the likelihood of danger 
connected with terrorism or preventing or reducing damage connected with 
terrorism. 
How the policy works 
4.2.13. A risk assessment should be submitted for approval by the City Cor poration as 
part of a planning application for major development or transport proposal s. The 
risk assessment should be proportionate to the nature of the risk identified through 
consultation with the City of London Police and will typically include: 
• Assess ment of the risk of structural damage from an attack; 
• Identification of measures to minimise any risk; 
• Detail on how the perimeter is treated, including glazing; 
• Consideration of adjacent land -uses and commuter routes . 
4.2.14. The City Corporation will liaise with the City of London Police in considering and 
approving risk assessments submitted as part of a planning application. 
Policy SA2: Dispersal Routes 
Applications for major commercial development and developments which pro pose night -
time uses must include a Management Statement setting out detailed proposals for the 
dispersal of patrons and workers from premises to ensure the safe egress of people, 
minimise the potential for over -crowding and reduce the instances of noise n uisance 
and anti-social behaviour , particularly in residential areas . 
Reason for the policy 
4.2.15. The City increasingly operates on a 7 day a week basis, with an increase in 
evening and night -time uses. This will result in an increase in pedestrian 
movements within the City as patrons enter and exit public houses, bars, night -
clubs and restaurants. Ant i-social behaviour, including noise, disturbance and 
odours arising from the operation of the premises can be disruptive to City 
residents and occupiers and proposals should seek to mitigate any negative 
impacts that may arise, incorporating the Agent of C hange principle. 
4.2.16. The City’s daytime population places pressure on the City’s public realm at peak 
times. It is therefore necessary to provide details of dispersal routes as part of 
planning applications for major commercial developments to understand their 
implications for movement and amenity. 
4.2.17. The planning and design of d ispersal routes should take into account the needs 
of people with physical or mental disabilities and people with restricted mobility.

   How the policy works 
4.2.18. The dispersal of patrons from premises, particularly late at night should not have 
an unacceptable impact on the amenity of residents and other noise -sensitive 
uses. Adverse impacts will require mitigation in line with Policy CV4: Evening and 
Night -time Ec onomy. 
4.2.19. Major commercial developments should incorporate measures to reduce 
pedestrian flow at peak times or provide alternative routes to avoid over -crowding 
on existing streets to ensure the safety and security of the City and to avoid further 
stress on the City’s public realm. 
4.2.20. A Management Statement will be required, setting out the measures 
incorporated into the scheme to mitigate the adverse impacts of night -time 
economy uses. Early engagement with nearby residents and occupiers, as well as 
the City of London Police and the City Corporation as Licensing Authority , can help 
ensure that the measures contained in the Management Statement are appropriate 
to local circumstances. Assessment of the Management Statement will have regard 
to the City of London Noise Strategy, the provisions of the City of London 
Statement of Licensing Policy and any submitted licence application operating 
schedule. 
Policy SA3: Designing in Security 
1. Security measures must be incorporated into the design of development at an early 
stage avoiding the need to retro -fit measures that adversely impact on the public 
realm or the quality of design. Applicants must liaise with the City Corporation and 
the City of London Police and inc orporate their advice into the scheme design as 
required. 
2. Security measures should be designed within the development’s boundaries and 
integrated with those of adjacent buildings and surrounding public realm. Area -wide 
approaches should be considered. 
3. All development should be designed to minimise the need for Hostile Vehicle 
Mitigation on the public highway. Developers will be expected to contribute towards 
the cost of necessary and proportionate on-street mitigation of the risk of vehicle 
attacks in the vicinity of their developments , or within a wider area where area-based 
security measures are proposed . 
4. Where mixed use schemes are proposed, developments must provide independent 
primary and secondary access points, ensuring that the proposed uses are separate 
and self -contained. 
5. All security measures which are expected to be more than very short -term shou ld be 
sympathetic to surrounding buildings, the public realm and any heritage assets, and 
must be of a high -quality design. 
6. An assessment of the environmental impact of security measures will be required. It 
should address the visual impact and impact on p edestrian flows.

 Reason for the policy 
4.2.21. Measures to design out crime , including counter -terrorism measures , should be 
integral to development proposals and may be applicable to crowded spaces 
around a development as well as the building itself. Security me asures should be 
proportionate to the risk and the likely consequences of an attack , deter terrorism, 
assist in the detection of terrorist activity and help mitigate its effects . Late 
consideration of security in developments can be more costly, inefficient, and less 
effective, and can have a negative impact on the architectural quality and de sign of 
a building and the surrounding public realm. These difficulties can be avoided by 
considering security at the early design stage. 
How the policy works 
4.2.22. All new developments must incorporate appropriate security provision to reduce 
the risk and the likely impact of an attack. It is not always possible to provide 
security measures wholly within the building or development site, particularly when 
there is a need to provide stand -off distances to protect against potential vehicle -
borne attacks, or where the building line is immediately bounded by public 
highway. Security features for individual buildings on the public highway should be 
a last resort when all other alternative proposals have been exhausted including 
the scope for an area -based approach. 
4.2.23. A collective approach to security is likely to be more effective than an individual 
building approach, particularly in areas of high -density development such as the 
City Cluster. The City Corporation will use s106 planning obligations requiring 
developers t o contribute to m easures to enhance collective security , where 
appropriate . 
4.2.24. In considering the impact of new development on the public realm, the City 
Corporation will take into account the need for additional security measures within 
the public realm to reduce the risk to individuals from motor vehicles and the 
potential for vehicles to mount pavements. Developers will be expected to 
contribute towards the cost of on -street mitigation of the risk of vehicle attacks in 
the vicinity of their developments , through the use of s106 planning obligation s. 
4.2.25. Developments should aim to achieve a high level of natural surveillance of all 
surrounding public areas including the highway. Mixed use developments can 
generate greater activity and surveillance, but a mix of uses within individual 
buildings may give rise to problems of security, management and amenity. The 
provision of independent primary and secondary access points will be required so 
that proposed uses are separate and self -contained. In appropriate circu mstances, 
use of CCTV should be considered. 
4.2.26. Early engagement with the City of London Police and the City Corporation is 
essential to ensure that security measures are appropriate to evolving threats . 
Where the development has an impact on heritage assets, early discussion with 
Historic England is also recommended. 
50  
 
     
 
  
    
   
 
   4.2.27. Design and Access Statements should incorporate recommendations from the 
City of London Police, City Corporation and ‘Secured by Design’ principles or 
equivalent, setting out how security has bee n considered at the design stage . 
Advice in the City Corporation’s Public Realm Technical Manual should be 
incorporated into proposals to ensure developments offer a lasting contribution to 
the streets and spaces of the City.

    4.3. Housing 
Context 
4.3.1. Housing is vital for the City’s future economy and its communities. A shortage of 
housing, particularly affordable housing , is one of the main barriers to future 
business and community growth in the City and across London. High quality, 
affordable housing is also essential to meet the housing needs of those of the 
City’s communities on lower incomes . 
4.3.2. The permanent residential population of the City, estimated to be around 8,000 , is 
small in comparison to the daily working population in excess of 520,000 . The 
GLA’s 2016 -based projections suggest that the City’s population (excluding those 
with main homes elsewhere) will have a modest increase to approximately 10,000 
by 2036. As the City’s housing stock increases the resident population does not 
increase in p roportion as many residential units are used as second homes or for 
short term letting . The 2011 Census indicated that there were 1,400 second homes 
in the City of London. 
4.3.3. The majority of the City’s housing is concentrated around the edge of the City in 
four estates (the Barbican, Golden Lane, Middlesex Street and Mansell Street). 
Other residential areas are located in Smithfield, the Temples, parts of the riverside 
(Queenhithe), Fleet Street (City West), Carter Lane and around Botolph Lane. Most 
residentia l units in the City are flats with one or two bedrooms, which is consistent 
with the need assessment of unit sizes recommended in the City of London 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) 2016. There have also been a 
number of developments providing sh orter term accommodation (short lets or 
serviced apartments). 
4.3.4. Most new residential development has been located in or near existing residential 
areas in accordance with Local Plan policy.  This allows greater opportunity to 
protect residential amenity and deliver a high -quality residential environment. 
Residential clustering reduces potential conflict with commercial and office uses . 
There may be occasional opportunities for new residential development on 
appropriate sites near residential areas, such as through the re -use of heritage 
assets, where the potential to meet future office needs may be limited by site -
specific considerations . 
4.3.5. References to housing in this Plan include market and affordable housing 
(comprising social rented housing, affordable rented housing and intermediate 
housing) , hostels, sheltered and extra -care housing . It also includes innovative 
housing products, such as Built to Rent and Co -Living accommodation which are 
likely to have a n increasing role in meeting future housing needs , particu larly for 
City workers at an early stage of their careers . Student housing will contribute 
towards meeting general housing need at the national ratio of 2.5 student rooms to 
1 residential unit .

 Housing requirement 
4.3.6. The NPPF sets out a standardised approach to assessing housing need and 
requires strategic planning authorities to follow this approach in setting housing 
targets in Local Plans. The City of London Local Plan is required to be in general 
conformity with the London Plan, which sets a housing target for the City and the 
London boroughs. 
4.3.7. The London Plan’s strategic framework includes Policy SD5 which indicates that 
residential development is inappropriate in the commercial core of the City of 
London. Within this context it requires the City of London to deliver 1,460 new 
homes during the period 2019/20 – 2028/29, with the annual average rate 
continuing beyond 20 28/29 until such time as the London Plan is further reviewed. 
In Policy S3 the City’s housing requirement is expressed as a total of 2,482 
dwellings for the Plan period to 2036, which represents the 10 -year London Plan 
target of 1,460 dwellings plus the co mbined annual average of 146 dwellings for 
the seven years post 2028/29 (1,022 dwellings). The housing requirement beyond 
2028/29 will be kept under review and may need to be altered to ensure general 
conformity with any subsequent review of the London Pla n. The London Plan also 
includes a target that 740 units should be provided on small sites of less than 0.25 
hectares in size over the 2019/20 – 2028/29 period. 
4.3.8. Different assessment methods provide different figures for local housing need. 
The City’s 2016 SHMA assessed the level of housing need, including the needs of 
those requiring supported and specialised accommodation in the City, over the 
period 2014 -36 using the latest population and household projections. The SHMA 
identified an objectively assessed need for an annual average of 126 dwellings per 
year. Using the national standard method for assessing local housing need at the 
time of preparing this Plan, the City’s minimum annual local housing need figure 
over the ten -year period from 2020 to 2030 wou ld be 11 2. 
4.3.9. The City Corporation recognises that the wider housing needs across London 
support the case for a higher level of housing in the City than indicated by the 
City’s SHMA. This Local Plan therefore seeks to meet the London Plan housing 
target , which has been applied to the whole of the Local Plan period as explained 
above. 
4.3.10. Housing delivery in the City is impacted by the volatile nature of the wider 
London housing market. If past volatile trends continue, new housing delivery in the 
City is likel y to fluctuate from year to year and monitoring and delivery performance 
should therefore be assessed against overall delivery in the period up to 2028/29, 
rather than on an annual basis. The City Corporation has prepared a Housing 
Trajectory which shows t hat the supply of small and larger windfall sites, together 
with sites in the development pipeline, will provide sufficient capacity to meet the 
London Plan by 2028/29 . 
4.3.11. The City Corporation’s Article 4 Direction which removes permitted development 
rights for the change of use of offices to res idential , the size and commercial 
character of the City and the priority given to commercial development through 
London Plan Policy SD5 , all mean that new housing development in the City of

 London has been delivered through ‘windfall’ development rather than through the 
allocation of sites. City Corporation monitoring shows that in the period 2011/12 to 
2021/22 , completions and permissions on windfall sites will have delivered an 
annual average of 1 98 dwellings per year . It is anticipated that windfalls will 
continue to deliver the majority of housing. The City Corporation has published a 
brownfield land register on its website, identifying land that is suitable for residential 
development in accorda nce with government requirements. 
4.3.12. The Mayor of London prepares a Strategic Housing Land Availability 
Assessment (SHLAA) for London, providing guidance on the amount of land 
potentially available in the City for residential development. The 2017 SHLAA 
prepared to inform the draft London Plan 2017 identifies a potential s upply of large 
housing sites in the City in the period 2019 -2029 of 527 dwellings and an annual 
average of 74 dwellings on sites under 0.25 hectares, based on past trends . This 
provision would be sufficient to meet London Plan housing targets up to 2029 . 
Beyond 2029 and up to the end of the Local Plan period, it is expected that further 
windfalls will come forward to ensure that the City of London can meets its housing 
requirements for the longer term. In the event that monitoring demonstrates that 
insufficient housing land is coming forward, the City Corporation will review this 
Plan or bring forward a partial review relating to housing land supply . 
4.3.13. The City Corporation will continue to support the delivery of new market and 
affordable housing on its own housing estates and other appropriate land holdings 
outside the Square Mile in fulfilment of its ambition to deliver a significant number 
of new homes and contribute towards the delivery of new housing to meet 
London’s wider housing needs. 
4.3.14. The City Corporation is the strategic housing authority for the City of London and 
a landlord responsible for over 1,900 social te nanted properties and over 900 
leaseholder properties across London. The City Corporation provides over 1,500 
social housing units on 11 estates that it owns and manages outside of the City of 
London in the six London boroughs of Southwark, Islington, Lewi sham, Lambeth, 
Hackney and Tower Hamlets. This is in addition to social housing provided within 
the City. 
4.3.15. The City Corporation has committed to play a leading role in tackling the 
housing shortage in London with a pledge to build hundreds of new social homes 
and thousands of additional mixed tenure homes. The City Corporation aims to 
deliver at least 700 new social homes on City -owned land and housing estates with 
potential for renewal and expansion. Where these homes are outside of the City, 
the City Corporation normally seeks joint nomination rights with the host borough to 
ensure that the housing can meet both City of London and host borough housing 
need. The City Corporation as a strategic landowner across London is seeking to 
deliver a further 3,000 mixed tenure homes on other sites in partnership with other 
providers, in recognition of the need for additional housing across London to meet 
housing needs. 
4.3.16. The City Corporation’s plans to build new homes have encouraged both public 
and private sec tor partners to propose development opportunities and potential 
joint ventures. Options to increase the supply of new homes beyond the City

 Corporation’s own sites are being explored. The planned co -location of the City 
Corporation owned and managed whole sale markets (Smithfield Meat Market, 
Billingsgate Fish Market and New Spitalfields Fruit and Vegetable Market) onto one 
site in Dagenham would provide an opportunity for mixed use redevelopment which 
could include housing. Billingsgate is a 5 -hectare site next to Canary Wharf and 
New Spitalfields is a 13 -hectare site in Leyton. 
Affordable Housing 
4.3.17. The City of London is an expensive area to live in. ONS data shows that the 
affordability ratio of lower quartile house prices to lower quartile residential 
earni ngs in 2016 was 17.51, above the London average of 13.32 and the England 
average of 6.91. The City of London SHMA shows that r ental prices in the City 
were significantly above the London -wide average or the average for inner London, 
indicating a significant problem of affordability. Overall, the SHMA suggests a need 
for an additional 69 affordable dwellings per year to meet affordable housing 
needs. 
Gypsy and traveller accommodation 
4.3.18. The London Plan indicates that, in the absence of an up to date local gypsy and 
traveller needs assessment, boroughs should use the need figure set out in Table 
4.4 of the London Plan . This table indicates that there is no need for specific gypsy 
and traveller accommodation in the City of London. The City Corporation will work 
with the Mayor and London Boroughs in the preparation of a London -wide Gypsy 
and Traveller Accommodation Needs Assessment . 
Strategic Policy S3: Housing 
The City Corporation will protect existing housing and amenity and encourage additional 
housing concentrated in or near the identified residential areas to meet the City’s needs 
by: 
Making provision for a minimum of 2,482 net additional dwellings between 2019/20 
and 2035/36 : 
• encouraging new housing development on appropriate sites in or near 
identified residential areas ; 
• protecting existing housing where it is of a suitable quality and in a suitable 
location; 
• exceptionally, allowing the loss of isolated residential units where there is a 
poor level of amenity ; and 
• refusing new housing where it would prejudice the primary business function of 
the City or be contrary to Policy OF2. 
2. Ensuring sufficient affordable housing is provided to meet the City’s housing need 
and contributing to London’s wider housing needs by: 
• ensuring the delivery of a minimum of 50% affordable housing on public sector 
land; and 
55  
 
     
    
     
 
     
    
     
  
 
    
   
  
 
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
 
  
 
    
      
       
    
   
    
   
    
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
     
 
  
 
 • requiring residential developments with the potential for 10 or more units to 
provide a minimum of 35% affordable housing on -site. Exceptionally, new 
affordable housing may be provided off-site, or through an equivalent cash -in 
lieu payment , if evidence is provided to the City Corporation’s satisfaction that 
on-site provision cannot be satisfactorily delivered and is not viable ; and 
• providing a mix of affordable tenures, addressing identified need in the City of 
London, including social or London affordable rented housing and intermediate 
housing (living rent, shared ownership or other genuinely affordable products) 
for rent or sale . 
3. Requiring a publicly accessible viability and feasibility assessment to be submitted to 
justify any proposals that do not meet on -site or off -site affordable housing 
requirements in this policy. Where policy targets are not able to be met when an 
application is decided, the City Corporation will require an upwards only review 
mechanism to be applied to ensure that the benefits of any subsequent uplift in 
values or redu ction in costs are reflected in affordable housing contributions. 
4. Ensuring that other new land uses within identified residential areas are compatible 
with residential amenity . 
5. Requiring 10% of new dwellings to meet Building Regulation requirement M4(3) 
‘wheelchair user dwellings’ and 90% of new dwellings to meet Building Regulation 
requirement M4(2) ‘accessible and adaptable dwellings ’. 
Reason for the policy 
4.3.19. London has a severe housing shortage caused by a growing population and an 
inadequate supply of housing units. The lack of suitable and affordable housing 
has been identified by many businesses and business groups as a key constraint 
to further economic de velopment and investment. The scale of housing proposed 
will contribute towards meeting local and wider London housing needs whilst still 
ensuring that the City remains predominantly a commercial office centre of national 
importance. New and innovative models of providing housing , including Build to 
Rent and Co -living , will be encouraged to meet changing housing needs . 
4.3.20. New housing in the City may be suitable for people that need to live near their 
workplace, especially key workers. Suitabl y located housing in the City can 
address local housing need and make a modest contribution to alleviating the 
housing shortage in Lon don and relieving pressure on the transport system. 
4.3.21. The London Plan includes a detailed policy which supports Build to Rent 
developments. Build to Rent accommodation is specifically designed for renting , is 
typically owned by institutional investors , offers the potential for longer term returns 
for investors and important ly, longer lease terms and security for tenants . The City 
Corporation will support Build to Rent in or near the City’s residential areas and 
where it meets the detailed requirements in the London Plan . 
4.3.22. The City Corporation considers that there is potential within or near the identified 
residential areas for Co-living accommodation and will encourage such provision 
on appropriate sites . Co-living accommodation will typically provide private ensuite

 bedrooms , shared social spaces and co-working spaces with the latest smart 
technology. They are often suitable for people at early stages of their career when 
their ability to afford self -contained ac commodation may be limited. 
4.3.23. Where appropriate, t he City Corporation will support the appropriate 
regeneration of residential estates in the City where it will deliver improved living 
conditions for existing tenants and provide additional housing to meet housing 
needs. 
4.3.24. Many households in London already require accessible or adapted housing to 
lead dignified and independent l ives. More Londoners are living longer and with the 
incidence of disability increasing with age, older people should have the choice of 
remaining in their own homes rather than moving to alternative accommodation. 
How the policy works 
4.3.25. To ensure that permissions for new housing ar e built out in a timely fashion , 
developers should provide information on the expected completion date for new 
residential development . The City Corporation will keep this under review and 
expect developers to liaise with the Corporation where it becomes a pparent that 
anticipated completion dates cannot be achieved. 
4.3.26. There is a presumption in national policy and the London Plan that new 
affordable housing associated with housing development should be provided on -
site. The City Corporation will expect developers to deliver on-site affordable 
housing in new housing development above the affordable housing threshold 
unless it can be demonstrated through robust assessments that on -site provision is 
not feasible or via ble and that off -site provision would better deliver mixed and 
inclusive communities than on -site provision. 
4.3.27. The City Corporation requires commercial development to make a financial 
contribution towards off -site affordable housing delivery instead of deliv ering mixed 
use development including housing on commercial sites. These contributions are 
used to deliver new affordable housing principally on City Corporation housing 
estates within and outside the City of London. 
4.3.28. Land within the City is an expensive an d limited resource and there is a policy 
priority to deliver new office floorspace to strengthen its strategically important 
business role. The City Corporation therefore also works with housing partners to 
deliver new affordable housing on sites in the Ci ty fringe and in neighbouring 
boroughs, principally on City Corporation -owned housing estates, utilising 
commuted sums from commercial and housing developments within the City. This 
approach has been supported by the GLA and has provided affordable housing in 
locations in or near the City that meet local housing need, whilst making the best 
use of scarce City land for strategically important commercial activity. Although 
some affordable housing provision outside the City will continue to be funded by 
contri butions from commercial development in the City, the presumption in this 
Plan is that new housing development in the City should provide affordable housing 
on-site.

  4.3.29. The London Plan and the Mayor’s Affordable Housing and Viability 
Supplementary Planning Gui dance set a strategic target for 50% of all new homes 
across London to be affordable, with a minimum threshold of 35% affordable 
housing on all developments comprising more than 10 units or which have a 
combined floorspace greater than 1,000m2. The Mayor h as adopted a threshold 
approach to the consideration of applications for housing. Schemes which meet or 
exceed 35% affordable housing , or 50% on public sector land, are not required to 
submit viability information. Where a n application does not me et these 
requirements, a viability assessment is required and the development will be 
subject to viability review as development progresses. 
4.3.30. In light of the Mayor’s approach and the shortage of available affordable housing 
to meet the needs of London’s workforce, a minimum of 35% affordable housing 
will be required on residential schemes in the City, with an ambition to deliver 
higher levels of affordable housing where this i s viable. On public sector owned 
land, the higher 50% target set out in the London Plan will be applied. The 
presumption is that affordable housing provision should be made on -site and all 
sites will be expected to deliver at least the minimum required le vel of affordable 
housing. Off-site provision or cash in lieu contributions will only be accepted in 
exceptional cases . In exceptional cases where off -site provision or cash in lieu 
contributions are considered to be acceptable in principle, the off-site provision , or 
the financial contribution, will be set at a level which captures the full uplift in value 
when delivering 100% market housing. This will ensure that the development is not 
more viable when the affordable housing obligation is satisfied through off -site 
provision or a cash in lieu payment in comparison to on -site delivery. The level of 
off-site provision, or th e amount of the cash in lieu payment, must be sufficient to 
deliver at least the same number, size and type of affordable homes that would be 
required on -site. Further guidance on affordable housing requirements, including 
the methodology for calculating the level of cash -in lieu or off -site contr ibutions 
required will be set out in the City Corporation’s Planning Obligations SPD. This 
SPD will be kept under review and amended as required to ensure financial 
contribution s keep pace with the cost of delivering affordable housing and will 
continue to be sufficient to meet the full affordable housing requirements set out in 
this Plan . 
4.3.31. Developments which propose lower levels of affordable housing , or where a 
developer considers particular circumstances e xist that make a policy compliant 
scheme unviable, will need to be supported by robust viability assessments. These 
assessments will be published alongside other publicly accessible planning 
application information on the City Corporation’s website. The Ci ty Corporation will 
commission an independent review of submitted assessments, with the cost being 
met by the applicant. Consideration of viability and overall levels of affordable 
housing should take place at pre -application stage to avoid unnecessary del ays in 
the determination of submitted planning applications. 
4.3.32. The requirement for on -site affordable housing in this Plan must be reflected in 
the price paid for land for residential development in the City. Overpaying for a site 
will not be regarded as an appropriate justification for failing to meet the affordable 
housing target.

594.3.33. Where a viability assessment demonstrates that the Plan’s affordable housing 
targets cannot be met, the City Corporation will require an upwards only review 
mechanism to be includ ed within any s106 planning obligation to ensure that any 
increases in scheme value or reduction in cost are appropriately reflected in 
increased affordable housing contributions. The detailed wording and timing of 
these review mechanisms will be determine d on a case by case basis, having 
regard to the City Corporation ’s Supplementary Planning Document and 
Supplementary Planning G uidance prepared by the Mayor in support of the London 
Plan. 
4.3.34. Various types of affordable housing are included within the national definition of 
affordable housing. The London Plan indicates that a minimum of 30% should be 
low cost rented homes, including social rent and London affordable rent, and a 
minimum of 30% should be intermediate products, such as shared ownership.  The 
remai ning 40% should be determined by the relevant borough based on identified 
need. The City’s SHMA found that the need for intermediate housing products was 
relatively low and that social rented units would most successfully address the 
City’s affordable hous ing needs. However, different and innovative forms of 
affordable housing ar e being developed and the viability and suitability of particular 
tenures is likely to change over the Plan period. The tenure of affordable housing 
will therefore need to be determined on a site by site basis, having regard to 
evidence of need in the City and London Plan requirements . Developers should 
liaise with the City Corporation’s Department of Community and Children’s 
Services to determine an approp riate mix for proposed schemes . 
4.3.35. The term ‘intermediate’ housing covers a range of different housing types, 
including shared ownership products, other low -cost homes for sale and 
intermediate rent. The City Corporation will take a flexible approach toward s 
intermediate housing, based on the circumstances of each site, and will encourage 
provision that meets the needs of essential local workers where possible. 
Policy HS1: Location of New Housing 
1. New housing will be encouraged on suitable sites in or near identified residential 
areas. Within these areas a mix of appropriate residential, commercial and other 
uses will be permitted. 
2. New housing must not: 
• prejudice the primary business function of the City, or result in the loss of 
viable office accommodation, contrary to Policy OF2; 
• inhibit the development potential or business activity in neighbouring 
commercial buildings and sites; or 
• result in poor residential amenity within existing and proposed development, 
including excessive noise or disturbance. 
3. Where existing residential estates are being redeveloped, an increased number of 
residential units will be expected and the existing affordable housing on-site must 
be re-provided with at least the equivalent floorspace and tenure of affordable 
housing. Affordable housing which is re-provided must be offered to existing 
tenants at rents and service charges equivalent to those in the properties being replaced.  
 
    
  
  
     
   
   
    
 
    
      
 
  
 
  
   
    
 
   
    
    
 Reason for the policy 
4.3.36. The City is a busy and sometimes noisy place, with a high density of 
development and business activity at all times during the day and evening, 7 days 
a week which has the potential to cause disturbance to residents. Large parts of 
the City are unsuitable for new housing because it could have an adverse impact on the City’s primary business role and would be likely to have poor residential 
amenity. The London Plan indicates that residential development is inappropriate in identified parts of the City to ensure that the current and future potential to 
assemble sites and deliver office development is not compromised by residential development. Elsewhere in the City, offices and other strategic functions of the 
Central Activities Zone should be given greater weight in planning terms than residential development, except in wholly residential streets or predominantly residential neighbourhoods. 
4.3.37. The City’s policy approach is therefore to encourage new housing to be located 
within or near the identified residential areas shown in Figure 7, where reasonable residential amenity consistent with a central London location can be achieved. This approach helps to minimise disturbance to residents within the areas, while reducing potential conflict with the development and operation of commercial uses.

  4.3.38. Due to the size and unique character of the City, all new housing has previously 
come forward on ‘windfall’ brownfield sites through the redevelopment or 
conversion of existing buildings as opportunities arise. This pattern of housing 
delivery is projected to continue throughout the life of this new Plan , delivering 
sufficient new hous ing over the Plan period to meet London Plan targets. There is 
no need to allocate sites in the Local Plan to meet housing targets . 
How the policy works 
4.3.39. To accord with office floorspace policy OF2, applicants proposing 
redevelopment involving the loss or c hange of use of existing office 
accommodation must provide robust evidence to demonstrate that the site is not 
suitable and viable for longer term office use and the proposal will not prejudice the 
primary business function of the City. However, the City C orporation will take a 
more flexible approach to the loss of office floorspace in appropriate 
circumstances, where development within or near the residential areas will provide 
additional housing. This could be particularly appropriate where the proposed 
housing offers Build to Rent or Co -Living accommodation suitable for workers at an 
early stage of their careers.  Further details are set out in the Office Use SPD. 
4.3.40. Residential development will not normally be permitted along streets which have 
high levels of noise and air pollution unless robust evidence is submitted which 
demonst rates how the development will mitigate the impact of that noise and 
pollution. 
4.3.41. Regeneration of housing estates will often involve the redevelopment of existing 
homes. Regenerati on schemes should deliver an increased number of dwellings , 
where this is compatible with the delivery of a high -quality living environment for 
existing tenants. Existing affordable housing must be replaced at an equivalent 
tenure and offered to existing tenants at rents and service charges levels 
equivalent to those in the properties being replaced.  This will help protect 
established local communities. 
Policy HS2: Loss of housing 
The net loss of existing housing units , including the amalgamation of residential units, 
will not be permitted except where: 
• they provide poor amenity to residents which cannot be improved; or 
• they do not have a separate entrance; or 
• exceptionally, they are located outside identified residential areas and their 
loss would enable beneficial development for the business City. 
Reason for the policy 
4.3.42. The net loss of existing housing units will be resisted because of the limited 
opportunities to replace it in the City. This policy will also be applied to proposals 
for the amalgamation of adjoining residential units unless the existing 
accommodation is o f such poor quality that it cannot provide a reasonable standard 
61  
 
  
  
  
 
  
     
    
 
  
   
  
  
   
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
   
      
 
  
 
  
    
   
    
   
   
  
 
      
 
   
   
  
   
     of amenity, or the proposed unit would meet a clearly identified need for larger 
family accommodation. Exceptionally the net loss of existing housing may be 
acceptable outside residential are as where the development of offices will have a 
significant beneficial impact for the City. Isolated residential units outside identified 
residential areas can suffer poor amenity, such as noise nuisance and other 
disturbance due to non -residential uses in close proximity, including clubs and 
pubs , and can be adversely affected by the operation of the business City. 
Policy HS3: Residential environment 
The amenity of existing residents will be protected by resisting uses which would cause 
unacceptable disturbance from noise, fumes and smells and vehicle or pedestrian 
movements. 
1. New noise -generating uses should be sited away from residential uses where 
possible. Where residential and other uses are located within the same development 
or area, adequate noise mitigation measures must be provided within the new 
development and, where required, planning conditions will be imposed to protect 
residential amenity. 
2. All development proposals should be designed to minimise overlooking and seek to 
protect the privacy, day lighting and sun lighting levels to adjacent residential 
accommodation. 
3. All residential development proposals must accord with the ‘Agent of Change’ 
principle, demonstrat ing how potential adverse noise impa cts on and between 
dwellings will be mitigated by layout, design and materials. This principle is 
applicable when new housing proposals might otherwise constrain existing uses. 
4. The cumulative impact of planning applications for individual developments on t he 
amenity of existing residents will be considered. 
Reason for the policy 
4.3.43. The City is predominately a centre of business, with activity taking place at all 
times during the day and evenings , 7 days a week.  This sometimes results in 
noise and disturbance to residents from new commercial development and 
commercial activities nearby. While the City Corporation will endeavour to minimise 
noise and other disturbance to residents it is inevitable that living in such a densely 
built-up area will result in some d isturbance from a variety of sources , particularly 
outside the identified residential areas . 
4.3.44. The need to minimise overlooking and overshadowing of residential 
accommodation is a consideration in the design and layout of both new residential 
buildings and other development. However due to the density of development in 
the City it may not always be possible to entirely avoid any impacts on amenity . 
How the policy works 
4.3.45. The ‘Agent of Change’ principle makes developers responsible for addressing at 
the design stage the environmental and other impacts of development on existing 
62  
 
  
  
  
 
 
    
  
 
   
 
  
     
   
     
    
    
  
  
 
  
      
  
  
  
      
    
  
       
   
 
     
 
 
     neighbouring occupiers.  Applicants for development near to existing residential 
properties shoul d identify potential impacts on residential amenity and set out 
measures to mitigate those impacts within their Design and Access Statements or 
other supporting application documents. Where required, planning conditions will 
be imposed to limit hours of op eration and servicing within predominantly 
residential areas. Policy CV4 addresses evening and night -time economy uses, 
while Policy HL3 seeks to minimise noise and light pollution. 
4.3.46. New residential development will also be subject to the Agent of Change 
principle and should include sufficient mitigation to ensure that the amenity of 
prospective owners or tenants is not compromised by existing uses in the vicinity. 
Policy HS4: Housing quality standards 
All new housing must be of a high-quality design and of a standard that facilitates the 
health and well -being of occupants and neighbouring occupants, and: 
• meets London Plan housing space standards; 
• meets standards for Secured by Design or similar certification; 
• maximises opportunities for provid ing communal open and leisure space for 
residents ; and 
• provides amenity space for individual units, where possible including outdoor 
space. 
Reason for the policy 
4.3.47. All new housing , including changes of use to housing from other uses , will be 
expected to provide well designed, high quality living environments, both internally 
and externally, incorporating principles of inclusive, secure and sustainable design. 
How the policy works 
4.3.48. Housing development should comply with the requirements in the London Plan 
and the Mayor’s London Housing Design Guide, unless it would not be feasible to 
do so because of site specific factors. The layout should incorporate sufficient 
space and facilities for waste , recycling bins and disabled and cycle parki ng. 
4.3.49. Amenity space for residents could include gardens, roof top gardens/terraces, 
private balconies and the provision of new sports and recreational facilities. Play 
space should also be included in line with the requirements in Policy HL8. There 
should be no distinction between amenity spaces and play areas for private and 
affordable housing residents. Proposals which seek to restrict access to such areas 
by affordable housing tenants will be refused. Daylight and s unlight to dwellings is 
addressed in the Design section of the Plan. 
63  
 
   
    
   
   
    
     
   
   
  
  
  
 
   
  
   
    
   
  
  
  
      
 
 
 
 
  
     
   
    
    
  
   
  
  
 
   
   
     Policy HS5: Short term residential letting 
1. Short term letting of permanent residential premises for over 90 days in a cal endar 
year will not normally be permitted as it would reduce the stock of permanent housing 
in the City and may adversely impact the amenity of existing residents. 
2. Short term letting to provide residential accommodation for commercial purposes will 
not be permitted unless the units are contained within a separate building and will not 
be permitted if mixed with permanent residential accommodation. 
3. Where short term residential letting is permitted for commercial purposes , conditions 
will be imp osed to prevent any later changes to permanent residential use in 
unsuitable accommodation or locations. 
Reason for the policy 
4.3.50. The City of London is primarily a commercial office centre. There is a small 
stock of permanent residential properties and this s tock needs to be maintained 
and increased to ensure that the City can continue to meet its assessed housing 
need. Loss of residential accommodation to short -term letting would reduce the 
overall stock of permanent housing and the City’s ability to meet its housing need. 
At the same time, there is some demand for residential accommodation that can be 
let on a short -term basis to provide for the needs of the City’s business community, 
particularly for visiting workers. Such short -term accommodation has a role to play 
but should not be mixed with permanent residential accommodation. 
How the policy works 
4.3.51. Under the Deregulation Act 2015, short term letting for less than 90 days in a 
calendar year of domestic premises liable for council tax does not require planni ng 
permission. Letting for periods of more than 90 days in a calendar year would 
require permission. 
4.3.52. Short term residential lets of more than 90 days in a calendar year within 
domestic premises will not normally be permitted as they would reduce the stock of 
permanent housing in the City, possibly jeopardis e housing delivery targets, and 
adversely impacting on the amenity of existing residents. 
4.3.53. Change of use of short term residential letting accommodation to permanent 
dwellings will normally be permitted where housing and amenity standards are met 
and the location accords with Policy HS1. 
4.3.54. The provision of short term lets for commercial purposes can help to meet the 
accommodation needs of business visitors. Such letting can have significant 
impact s on the amenity of neighbours by reason of noise, disturbance, and 
occasionally anti -social behaviour.  Where such accommodation is proposed, the 
units should be contained in a separate block that is designed and managed for 
this purpose rather than formi ng part of a mixed block of short term and permanent 
residential units or short term residential lets and commercial activities. 
64  
 
     
 
 
    
    
    
  
   
     
  
  
 
  
    
    
  
  
   
  
   
    
  
    
  
  
   
    
 
 
  
 
      
    
      
  4.3.55. The requirement for the provision of affordable housing in Policy S3 applies to 
the commercial provision of self-contained shor t let residential accommodation. 
Policy HS6: Student housing and hostels 
1. Proposals for new student accommodation and hostels should support the City of 
London’s primary business function and will only be permitted where they do not : 
• prejudice the primary business function of the City, or result in the loss of 
suitably located and viable office floorspace , contrary to Policy OF2; 
• have an adverse impact on the residential amenity of the area; and 
• involve the loss of permanent residential accommodation. 
2. Proposals for Purpose -Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) should be supported by 
identified further or higher educational institution s operating in the City of London or 
the Central Activities Zone. 
3. 35% of student housing on a site should be secured as affordable student 
accommodation as defined through the London Plan and associated guidance. 
4. The loss of existing student housing and ho stels to other suitable uses which are in 
accordance with Local Plan policies will be permitted where there is no longer a need 
to provide accommodation for CAZ based universities or there is evidence that 
student accommodation is impacting on residential or business amenity. 
Reason for the policy 
4.3.56. The demand for student accommodation in London continues to grow. Higher 
education provision is a key part of London’s attractiveness as a World City and 
supports the City of London’s commercial rol e. However, opportunities for 
residential development in the City are limited and s tudent housing may represent 
an opportunity lost to meet other housing needs in residential areas . 
How the policy works 
4.3.57. New Purpose -Built Student Accommodatio n (PBSA) should be supported by an 
identified further or higher educational institution for the housing of its own 
students.  To reduce the need to travel between student accommodation and 
educational institutions, PBSA providers should seek support from i nstitutions 
within the City or the Central Activities Zone through nomination agreements in line 
with London Plan requirements. Nomination agreements, secured by s106 
agreements, will be required for all affordable student accommodation. 
4.3.58. The Housing Deliv ery Test establishes a national ratio that every 2.5 student 
bedrooms in PBSA meet the same housing need as one conventional housing unit 
and contribute to meeting the City’s housing target at this ratio. 
65  
 
  
     
 
  
 
 
    
 
 
  
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
 
    
   
    
  
   
 
 
  
  
  
   
   
  
   
        
    
  
 
 
 4.3.59. National space and accessibility standards do not apply to student 
accommodation , but other Plan policies require inclusive and high quality design , 
which will assist in ensuring the needs of students with disabilities are 
accommodated. 
4.3.60. New student accommodation must not impact adversely on the amenity of 
existing residents or occupiers, either individually or cumulatively with other student 
accommodation developments. The Agent of Change principle will apply to new 
student accommodation. 
4.3.61. Hostels can contribute to providing accommodation for vulnerable homeless 
people. The City Corporation’s Homelessness Strategy outlines how the 
Corporation will seek to reduce the incidence of rough sleeping in the City through 
collaborative working with outreach services, health services, the City of Lon don 
Police, businesses and others. The Strategy seeks to provide appropriate 
accommodation options for homeless people, including through the use of s106 
contributions to deliver new affordable housing or hostels. Hostels may be 
acceptable within or near identified residential areas , where the amenity of existing 
occupiers is protected. 
Policy HS7: The Temples 
Within the Temples adjustments between professional and residential accommodation 
will be permitted where: 
• the overall balance of residential and professional chambers is maintained; 
• it is important to the functioning or character of the Temples, or to the 
continuing use of their buildings. 
Reason for the policy 
4.3.62. The Inner and Middle Temples are two of the Inns of Court which provide 
accommodation for the legal profession in the south west of the City between Fleet 
Street and the River Thames. Along with other nearby Inns of Court and the Royal 
Courts of Justice in Westminster, the Temples form part of a specialist legal cluste r 
recognised in the London Plan. 
4.3.63. The Temples mainly contain barristers’ chambers, together with other 
accommodation for Members of the Bar. The Inner and Middle Temples have a 
strong collegiate atmosphere due to the mix of residential and commercial uses. 
This mix of uses contributes to the historic interest and high environmental quality 
of the area and should be maintained. 
How the policy works 
4.3.64. In determining applications, the City Corporation will have regard to the 
importance of the continued existenc e of residential , office and support uses in the 
Temples and the contribution that this makes to their special character. However, 
the need to rationalise and refurbish chambers in order to maintain an efficient 
business and professional community is recognised.

 Policy HS8: Older persons housing 
The City Corporation will aim to ensure there is a sufficient supply of appropriate 
housing available for older people by: 
• making provision for a minimum of 170 net additional dwellings for older 
persons betwe en 2019/20 and 2035/36 ; 
• supporting development that meets the specific needs of older people; 
• supporting development that replaces existing provision for older people with 
better provision that addresses care needs or fosters independent living; 
• ensuring new development is inclusive and accessible to all to allow people to 
continue living in their own homes ; and 
• resisting development that involves the net loss of housing for older people. 
Reason for the policy 
4.3.65. The City of London has an ageing resident population profile, in line w ith 
national demographic trends. Some peop le will wish to remain in their own homes, 
with suitable adaptations , or may choose to move into specialist housing which 
caters for the needs of older people, with varying degrees of support. The City of 
London SHMA identifies a need for 67 specialist older person units over the life of 
the Plan, and the London Plan has an indicative figure of 10 units per year. 
How the policy works 
4.3.66. The City Corporation will work with developers to encourage the provision of 
sufficient accommodation suitable for older people, including provision of specialist 
older persons accommodation, where feasible, to meet identified needs . Housing 
suitable for older persons, including sheltered housing, is provided by th e City 
Corporation on its land and estates, inside and outside of the City. Provision 
outside the City may assist in meeting the need for older persons housing for City 
residents through nomination rights. Specialist older persons housing should 
deliver af fordable housing in line with Policy S 3. Some older or disabled residents 
may need regular visits from carers and healthcare professionals and the provision 
of visitor parki ng would support their ability to live in their own homes . This issue is 
addressed in Policy VT3 . 
Policy HS9: Self and custom housebuilding 
The City Corporation will encourage the provision of self and custom build units within 
large residential schemes. 
Reason for the policy 
4.3.67. The Self Build and Custom Housing Building Act 2015 requires councils to 
create a public register of individuals and groups who are interested in acquiring a 
plot to use for a self -build or custom build home. The City Corporation launched its 
own register for prospective self -builders in 2016. 
67  
 
   
  
     
   
    
 
  
    How the policy works 
4.3.68. There are no large areas of unused land in the City of London that would 
provide an opportunity to create serviced building plots. Furthermore, self -build and 
custom -build are likely to involve low er density development, which would confli ct 
with policies in the Plan which seek to maximise housing supply. Given these 
constraints, the City Corporation considers that the best prospect for bringing 
forward suitable land will be in conjunction with large housing developments where 
units can be built to shell and core and individually fitted out.

Support a Thriving Economy 
5.1. Offices 
Context 
5.1.1. The City is London’s historic business core and today represents the largest 
concentration of office -based employment in the capital.  It forms a world leadin g 
international financial and professional services centre, renowned for its financial, 
insurance and legal sectors which are the main office occupiers. The City is seeing 
a rapid increase in serviced offices and co -working providers, which offer more 
flexible workspace options and attract a more diverse range of occupiers including 
technology , creative enterprise and media companies. 
5.1.2. The whole of the City forms the business cluster and is suitable for commercial 
development. There are, however, reside ntial areas within the City where a mixture 
of residential and commercial uses will be permitted (see Policy S3). 
5.1.3. There were 23,580 businesses and 522,000 workers in the City in 2018 and 
employment is projected to continue to grow over the long term. Over 98% of all 
the City businesses are Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with fewer than 250 
employees; 80% have fewer than 10 employees. 
5.1.4. The intense concentration of business occupiers in a small area is a key part of 
the attraction for companies looking t o move into the City . The clustering of 
businesses is a vital part of the City’s operation and contributes to its reputation as 
a dynamic place to do business. 
5.1.5. The City lies wholly within London’s Central Activity Zone (CAZ) where the 
London Plan promotes further economic and employment growth. Prior to the 
Covid -19 pandemic, the GLA projec t that City of London employment will grow by 
116,000 from 2016 to 2036 , of which approximately 103,000 employees are 
estimated to be office based . London’s rapidly grow ing population will also create 
demand for more employment and for the space required to accommodate it. 
5.1.6. The Covid -19 pandemic is having significant health, wellbeing, social and 
economic impacts globally. The City of London has not been immune to these 
impacts and has seen a significant shift in working patterns to flexible and remote 
working, with major reductions in City footfall and use of the City’s retail, leisure 
and cultural assets. Flexible working patterns are likely to continue in some form for 
most businesses and employees post Covid, within a blended approach to office 
working. The likely reduction in office occupation densities due to Covid presents 
an opportunity for City offices and businesses to reinvent themselves and the way 
that they work . Economic modelling by the GLA suggests a gradual return of 
economic activity and a return to economic and employment growth. At the same 
time, the fundamentals underpinning the City’s success, its locational advantages 
and the benefits of collaboration a nd co -operation remain. Alongside continued 
investor and developer interest in the City as a place in which to do business, these 
69  
 
  
  
 
   
   
  
   
  
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  fundamentals suggest that the City will continue to prosper and, over the life of this 
Plan, will see further employment growt h and a need for additional office, creative 
and collaboration space. 
5.1.7. The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union will also have short and 
long-term effects on economic and employment growth depending on the detail of 
future trading arrangements . 
5.1.8. The City Corporation will continually review employment and office growth trends 
and the economic impacts of the Covid -19 pandemic and the UK’s departure from 
the European Union and will bring forward a review of this Plan to address 
changing trends, where necessary.

  Strategic Policy S 4: Offices 
The City Corporation will facilitate significant growth in office development of the highest 
quality to meet projected economic and employment growth by: 
1. Increasing the City’s office floorspace stock by a minimum of 2,000,000m2 net during 
the period 2016 to 2036, phased as follows: 
• 2016 – 2021 750,000m2 
• 2021 – 2026 750,000m2 
• 2026 – 2031 250,000m2 
• 2031 – 2036 250,000m2 
2. Ensuring that new floorspace is designed to be flexible to allow the transformation 
and adaptation of space to support new uses and different types and sizes of 
occupiers and to meet the need s of SMEs, innovative and start-up companies and 
those requiring move -on accommodation. 
3. Where app ropriate, encouraging the provision of affordable office workspace that 
allows small and growing businesses the opportunity to take up space within the City. 
4. Protecting existing office stock from being lost to other uses wh ere there is an 
identified need or where the loss would cause harm to the primary business function 
of the City. Where necessary, conditions may be attached to permissions for new 
office floorspace to secure its long -term use for such purposes. 
Reason for the policy 
5.1.9. The City of London is a world leading international financial and professional 
services centre and has a nationally important role in the economy. To maintain 
this position, it is vital to ensure that sufficient office floorspace is available to meet 
projected employment growth and occupier demand and that additional office 
development is of high quality and suitable for a variety of occupiers. The overall 
office floorspace target of 2,000,000m2 is derived from the estimated growth in 
office employment between 2016 and 20 36 and represents a 23% increase in 
floorspace. 
5.1.10. Notwithstanding the short term impacts of the Covid -19 pandemic on occupier 
demand and construction activity, the City has a robu st development pipeline. In 
March 2020, approximately two -thirds of the total office floorspace target had either 
been completed since the baseline date of 2016 or was under construction. While 
the long term impacts of the pandemic on the office market are uncertain, flexible 
working has become a key part of the business environment and it seems likely 
that many City workers will choose to spend at least part of the week working 
remotely rather than from the office. However, this trend is expected to be 
counteracted by a shift towards lower occupation densities and the provision of 
more breakout space within offices. The overall impact on floorspace demand may 
therefore be broadly neutral. 
71  
 
   
 
   
   
    
  
 
   
   
  
  
  
 
   
        
   
    
     
   
   
     
     
   
  
  
    
 
  
    
  
   
 
 
  
  
   
    
 
 
  
 
   5.1.11. In 2016, 25% of take -up of office floorspace in the City of London w as from 
“Media and Tech” firms, compared to 28% from “Financial” companies, indicating 
an increasing shift away from the dominance of financial services, and an 
increasing demand from new types of occupiers. In 2018 , there were approximately 
41,000 persons in the City employed in Creative Industries. This broader range of 
occupiers is creating requirements for a broader range of office types . 
5.1.12. Demand for Incubator, Accelerator and Co -Working (IAC) floorspace is 
predicted to continue to grow across London a nd this type of accommodation is 
seen as important to the growth of SMEs. Delivering these types of workspace 
within the City will meet the needs of smaller businesses in particular and help to 
grow both the City and the wider London economy. 
5.1.13. As well as pr oviding flexible space, it is important to ensure that there is 
floorspace that is affordable to start -up and growing businesses. Accommodation 
costs are a major overhead for new businesses and rents in the City can be 
prohibitive to new occupiers. The Cit y has seen substantial growth in the serviced 
and co -working office market in recent years and flexibility of lease arrangements 
provides a range of opportunities to accommodate both new and growing 
businesses . At present there is no evidence that a specific policy requirement for 
subsidised workspace is needed in the City , but developers are encouraged to 
consider a range of leasing structures, including below market rents , where 
appropriate . The City Corporation is work ing closely with neighbouring boroughs to 
ensure that affordable workspace and move -on accommodation needs can be 
accommodated , in particular providing signposting and assistance to businesses in 
finding suitable office accommodation. 
How the policy works 
5.1.14. Strategic Policy S 4 indicates the amount of floorspace required to meet the 
forecast employment growth and will encourage the flexible floorspace needed to 
attract and retain a range of occupiers. 
5.1.15. The delivery of floorspace in the City will be phased across the plan period , with 
indicative phasing targets identified in the Policy . Phasing allows for short term 
monitoring of progress in meeting floorspace targets and effective planning for 
supporting services and infrastructure. A significant amount of office floorspac e is 
under construction in the City , much of which will be completed in the first 2 
phasing periods. It is expected that 75% of the floorspace target will be achieved 
by 2026, with the remaining 25% in the latter phases. 
5.1.16. The City Corporation has made an Ar ticle 4 Direction remov ing permitted 
development rights for the change of use of offices (B1a) to dwelling houses (C3) 
across the whole of the City.  The Direction is consistent with the approach to office 
development and protection of offices set out in t his Plan . 
5.1.17. Changes to the Use Classes Order introduced in September 2020 mean that 
offices could be converted to a range of other Class E commercial, business and 
service uses without planning permission. Given that the largest past losses of 
office accommo dation in the City have been to residential or visitor accommodation 
72  
 
  
   
   
 
  
  
      
  
     
   
  
    
  
     
  
  
   
  
   
    
  
 
   
   
 
    
  
  
  
 
  
    
    
   
    
   
  
 
 
 
  
 uses, this change is not expected to pose a significant risk to the City’s strategic 
role as a centre for financial and professional services. However, where permission 
is granted for off ice schemes that meet a specific identified need, conditions may 
be attached to ensure the impacts of any proposed later conversion of such space 
can be considered through the planning application process. 
Policy OF1: Office Development 
1. Office developmen t should: 
• be of a n outstanding design and an exemplar of sustainability; and 
• be designed for future flexibility to future proof the City’s office stock; and 
• provide office floorspace suitable for a range of occupiers; and 
• where appropriate, provide a prop ortion of flexible workspace suitable for 
micro, small and medium sized enterprises. 
2. Other commercial uses will be encouraged as part of office -led development, 
particularly at ground and basement levels, where such uses would not compromise 
the operation of office premises, would activate streets and provide supporting 
services for businesses, workers and residents . 
Reason for the policy 
5.1.18. A range of office floorspace is required to accommodate the future needs of the 
City’s office occupiers and this should include provision for incubator, co -working 
and accelerator space, as well as provision for larger firms where required. Flexible 
office floorspace is required that can be easily adapted to meet changing 
workplace and technology requirements and the needs of a variety of office 
occupiers. 
5.1.19. Offices are the predominant land use in the City, but complementary uses are 
required to provide supp orting activities and services for businesses, workers and 
residents in appropriate locations within the City. Complementary uses which 
contribute to the City’s economy include retail, leisure, education, health facilities 
and cultural uses. A mix of comme rcial land uses, in particular at ground floor and 
basement levels, may create active frontages enhancing an area’s vitality and 
provide important complementary services. They also provide opportunities for 
creativity, collaboration and social interaction, which are key to the success of the 
City’s business clusters. 
How the policy works 
5.1.20. Proposals for new office development should demonstrate design quality and 
flexibility to accommodate a range of businesses. Particular encouragement will be 
given to floorspace which meets the needs of small businesses, start-ups and 
incubator space. Office development should include a suitable mix of 
complementary commercial or other uses appropriate to the site and location and 
contribute to the creation of active frontages a t street level.

 Policy OF2: Protection of Existing Office Floorspace 
1. The loss of existing office floorspace will be resisted unless it can be demonstrated 
that: 
• there is no demand in the office market, supported by marketing evidence 
covering a period of no less than 12 months; and 
• refurbishment or re -provision of some or all of the office floorspace on the site 
would be unviable in the longer term, demonstrated by a viability assessment; 
or 
• the loss of office floorspace is limited to ground or below ground levels and 
propos ed new use s would be complementary to continu ed office use o n upper 
floors; or 
• the loss of office floorspace is within or near identified residential areas and 
would result in the provision of additional housing, particularly Build to Rent or 
Co-living accommodation . 
2. Where the above criteria have been met, the loss of office floorspa ce may be 
permitted provided that : 
• the proposed development would not compromise the potential for office 
development on sites within the vicinity and would have demonstrable wider 
benefits for other objectives of this Plan; and 
• the potential for re -provid ing a reduced amount of office floorspace within the 
development has been considered. 
Reason for the policy 
5.1.21. The City is the world’s leading international financial and professional services 
centre and is recognised as having a key role in the UK economy. T o maintain this 
position and accommodate the projected increase in employment and office 
floorspace, it is important to maintain existing office stock whilst accommodating 
future demand through the provision of flexible floorspace which is suitable for a 
range of occupiers. 
5.1.22. The protection of existing offices is important to ensure that there is a range of 
office stock to provide choice in terms of location and cost to potential occupiers. 
Proposals involving the loss of office accommodation that require p lanning 
permission will need to be supported by robust evidence of marketing and viability 
to ensure that viable offices can be retained to meet future office need. Following 
changes to the Use Classes Order introduced in September 2020, existing offices 
could be converted to a range of other Class E commercial, business and service 
uses without planning permission, unless there are specific planning conditions 
attached to a site which prevent this. 
5.1.23. Refurbishment of office floorspace will be encour aged to accommodate future 
needs, whilst aligning with the sustainability principles set out in Policy DE1 and the 
74  
 
     
  
  
    
    
   
     
     
 
     
     
  
   
      
  
    
  
    
  
        
    
   
  
   
   
  
  
   
   
   
     
  
 
   
      
        
 
 
 
 
 
 
 need to find suitable and sustainable uses for historic buildings. Historic buildings 
can provide affordable office stock though they have sp ecific constraints and 
opportunities which may affect the viability of refurbishment . 
How the policy works 
5.1.24. This policy will be applied on a sequential basis . Firstly , proposals need to 
demonstrate that there is no realistic demand for the exis ting office 
accommodation, or for refurbished or new office accommodation on the site , by 
complying with the criteria set out in Part 1 of the policy . 
5.1.25. The loss of office floorspace on the upper levels of buildings will require robust 
evidence to demonstra te why continued office use is not possible . This include s 
robust evidence of marketing of the building or site for continued office use over a 
period of at least 12 months. The City Corporation will need to be satisfied that the 
site/building has been offered at a realistic price commensurate with the value of 
the site/building for office use and that active promotion has been undertaken by 
the agents marketing the site over the period . Proposals must provide evidence 
that the continued office use of the site would be unviable in the longer term. 
5.1.26. Viability assessments submitted in accordance with this policy will be made 
public, other than in exceptional circumstances , as set out in Policy PC1 . Viability 
assessments should include the following : 
• Site description; 
• A valuation of the building in its existing use unfettered by any hope value; 
• Total costs of maintaining the building as existing and in the future; 
• Costs of refurbi shing or redeveloping the building for office use; 
• Information on rents and capital values; 
• Information on current and recent occupation; 
• Target rates of return (internal rate of return or other appropriate measure); and 
• Sensitivity testing to support th e robustness of the report conclusions. 
5.1.27. The change of use of office floorspace at ground and lower ground levels may 
improve the vibrancy of an area by introducing more active frontages and 
delivering more permeable buildings and spaces and will be exempte d from the 
requirement to provide viability and marketing evidence where it does not prejudice 
the use of the building or site for office purposes 
5.1.28. Within or near identified residential areas, the City Corporation may, in 
appropriate circumstances, take a m ore flexible approach to the conversion of 
office floorspace to residential use, particularly where the residential 
accommodation is of a type such as Build to Rent or Co -Living which may be more 
complementary to the business City. In such cases , there wou ld be no requirement 
to provide marketing and viability evidence under Part 1 of the policy. 
75  
 
     
    
     
 
   
  
    
   
 
 
      
  
  
     
        
  
  
  
   
  
    
    
   
      
  
     
   
      
    
  
 
  5.1.29. Further guidance on the evidence required to support the loss of office 
floorspace is set out in the Office Use SPD. Proposals which satisfy Part 1 of the 
policy will then need to comply with Part 2 of the policy by demonstrating that they 
are compatible with the wider objectives of the Plan and would not compromise 
office development on other sites in the vicinity. 
5.1.30. Where a proposal results in a reduced amount of office floorspace, account will 
be taken of the type and size of office floorspace provided and whether there is a 
specific need for office floorspace of that size and type in the City . 
Policy O F3: Temporary ‘Meanwhile’ Use s 
1. Temporary use of vacant comme rcial, business and service buildings or sites 
(‘meanwhile’ uses) will be permitted where the proposed use would not result in 
adverse impacts on the amenity of the surrounding area or the primary business role 
of the City. Where temporary permission is granted it will be for a period not 
exceeding 36 months and the site will revert to its prior lawful use thereafter. 
2. Residential development is not considered an appropriate meanwhile use and will not 
be permitted. 
Reason for the policy 
5.1.31. Where buildings or sites in Class E commercial, business or service uses are 
vacant, and development is not expected in the short term, ‘meanwhile’ or 
temporary uses will be supported to ensure the vitality and vibrancy of the City is 
maintained , subject t o the impact on surrounding uses. 
How the policy works 
5.1.32. ‘Meanwhile’ uses will be granted subject to conditions f or a maximum of 36 
months, after which the use will revert to its prior lawful use. Applications to extend 
the period of the ‘meanwhile’ use o r make it permanent will be considered aga inst 
the relevant policies in the Development Plan and will not be permitted unless it is 
demonstrated that the permanent loss of the prior lawful use is acceptable .

 5.2. Retailing 
Context 
5.2.1. Retailing is important for all the City’s communities – but retail demand is largely 
driven by City workers. This has resulted in a predominantly five-day (Monday -
Friday) trading week with footfall concentrated over weekday rush hours and lunch 
times. The City is , howe ver, becoming a 7 day a week destination, with more retail 
units catering for a growing weekend and evening trade . 
5.2.2. There is demand for a better range and quality of retail and leisure facilities. The 
above average spending power of the City’s growing wo rking and residential 
populations, longer and extended working and trading hours, the increasing 
number of visitors and the Square Mile’s high accessibility by public transport 
create significant opportunities for improvement to the retail offer. 
5.2.3. The ways in which people shop and use retail facilities are changing and the 
City’s retail offer needs to adapt to address changing consumer and leisure habits , 
whilst also retaining a focus on centres as places to shop . The Covid -19 pandemic 
has significa ntly reduced footfall in town centres and retail centres nationally and 
hastened the growth of online retailing, having short -term impacts on the vitality 
and viability of many retail and leisure facilities. Retail centres that provide a 
diverse range of town centre uses, including shops , services , creative and leisure 
activities are likely to be in a better position to respond to changing retail demand 
and recover from the impacts of Covid -19. In the City, as elsewhere, there has 
been a n expansion of experiential retail, leisure , entertainment and mixed uses , 
which can increase footfall at different times of the day and add to the visitor 
experience. Such uses are an important component of the City’s overall retail mix . 
Strategic Policy S 5: Retailing 
The City Corporation will seek to improve the quantity and quality of retailing and the 
retail environment, promoting the development of the City’s four Principal Shopping 
Centres (PSCs) and the linkages between them by: 
1. Focusing new retail development in the PSCs and encouraging movement between 
them by enhancing the retail environment along Retail Links. 
2. Supporting proposals that contribute towards the delivery of additional retail 
floorspace across the City to meet future demand up to 2036. 
3. Requiring major retail developments over 2,500m2 gross floorspace to be located 
within or near PSCs. Where suitable sites cannot be identified within PSCs, sites 
immediately adjoining the PSCs and in Retail Links should be considered. Ot her 
areas of the City will only be considered where no suitable sites are identified within 
or adjoining the PSCs and Retail Links. 
77  
 
     
    
 
    
    
  
       
  
 
 
  
   
 
   
  
   
   
     
   
 
  
  
   
    
    
    
  
  
   
  
  
 
    
 
     
    
 4. Requiring a Retail Impact Assessment for schemes of 2,500m2 gross floorspace and 
above outside PSCs . The cumulative impact of retail floorspace will be taken into 
account in the assessment of planning applications. 
5. Focusing comparison and convenience shops within the PSCs, with a broader mix of 
retail and appropriate town centre uses on the peripheries of the centres and the 
Retail Links. 
6. Supporting the provision of retail and other town centre uses that provide active 
frontages at street level across the City where they would not detract from the 
viability and vitality of the PSCs and the Retail Links. 
Reason for the policy 
5.2.4. Four Principal Shopping Centres (PSCs) have been identified which provide a 
variety of comparison and convenience shopping in the City of London: Cheapside, 
Moorgate/ Liverpool Street, Fleet Street and Leadenhall Market.  Cheapside is 
considered to b e the City’s ‘high street’ and has seen the most significant retail 
development in recent years. Moorgate /Liverpool Street PSC has potential to 
accommodate significant further retail floorspace, capitalising on the opening of the 
Elizabeth Line and becomin g a key retail destination. 
5.2.5. A Retail Needs Assessment undertaken in 2017 identified a need for 
approximately 200,000 m2 of additional retail floorspace up to 2036. This is an 
aspirational target based principally on projected employment growth in the City . 
The reduction in footfall and the increase in online retailing as a result of the Covid -
19 pandemic has reduced retail activity in the City, at least in the short term. The 
introduction of a Commercial, Business and Service use class, Class E, which 
replaces previous A1, A2 and A3 uses, reduces the City Corporation’s ability to 
manage the mix of retail uses. These changes are likely to impact on the projected 
level of retail growth. Nevertheless, the fundamental economic indicators 
underpinning the Local Plan remain and the patterns of growth identified in the 
Retail Needs Assessment remain valid. The Assessment identifies the potential for 
significant retail growth in and around the PSCs, with a focus on potential growth 
around Moorgate/Liverpool Street. Some growth is anticipated to come forward 
outside the PSCs, near them or along the Retail Links. 
5.2.6. The PSCs are recognised in the London Plan as ‘CAZ Retail Clusters’ that 
accommodate a range of other commercial uses alongside th e retail function. 
Outside the PSCs, retail units are dispersed across the City though many are on 
streets identified as Retail Links (see Figure 9 ), while others form convenient local 
centres or are isolated units. 
78  
 
  
       
  
  
   
       
   
  
     
     
   
    
 
   
   
   
   
     
  
        
 
    
   
Figure 9: Principal Shopping Centres a nd Retail Links 
How the policy works 
5.2.7. There are further opportunities to develop the City’s retail offer, allowing for a 
broad mix of retail facilities while maintaining a predominance of comparison and 
convenience retail use s. The role and status of the four PSCs will be strengthened , 
encouraging further retail development, enhancing the retail offer in the City, 
supporting its primary business function and the growing cultural activity within the 
City. Improvements to pedestrian links and the retail offer within the Retail Links 
will encourage shoppers to move between the PSCs by enabling increased activity 
along these connecting routes, and creating a welcoming and vibrant environment. 
5.2.8. Major retail development , defined as development over 2,500m2 gross 
floorspace, should locate within PSCs, but where suitable sites are not available 
sites on the edge of the PSCs or on identified Retail Links should be considered 
before other areas of the City . Smaller scale retail develop ment will be encou raged 
throughout the City, where it provide s an active frontage and facilities which meet 
the needs of the City’s working population or local residents. Particular 
encouragement will be given to convenience retail uses near to residential areas 
that serve the nee ds of residents . 
5.2.9. Active retail frontages should be provided at street level across the City. Other 
appropriate town centre uses, including leisure uses, will be acceptable where they 
provide an active frontage. Retail uses may be permitted on upper floors of major 
79  
 
    
   
   
   
    
 
      
 
  
 
 
  
   
      
 
  
  
    
    
  
  
 
     
    
  
  
  
   
 
  
 
   
  
 
  
   
     
  
 commercial developments, including in tall buildings , where they provide additional 
facilities which are acce ssible to the public and office occ upiers . 
Policy RE1: Principal Shopping Centres 
1. Principal Shopping Centres (PSCs) are designated frontages on the Policies Map. 
Sites or buildings that form part of a designated frontage are considered to be part of 
the PSC in their entirety. 
2. The role of the PSCs as concentrations of comparison and convenience shopping 
will be retained . The loss of ground floor retail frontages and/or floorspace will be 
resisted and additional retail provision of varied unit sizes and frontage lengths will be 
encouraged , supported by complementary uses that increase footfall and provide 
active frontages. Where planning permission is required, proposals for changes 
between retail uses within the PSCs will be assessed against: 
• the contribution the unit makes to the function and character of the PSC; and 
• the effect of the proposal on the area in terms of the si ze of the unit, the length 
of its frontage, the composition and distribution of retail uses within the 
frontage and the location of the unit within the frontage 
Reason for the policy 
5.2.10. The frontages of the four PSCs are defined on the Policies Map. Concentra ting 
major new retail development in or near PSCs will ensure that their vitality and 
viability is maintained and will provide an opportunity to focus retail facilities in the 
most appropriate areas of the City, enhancing these as shopping destinations for 
City residents, workers and visitors. In accordance with the definition of PSCs set 
out in this policy, a sequential or retail impact assessment will not be required for 
retail development on any site or building that contains a designated frontage. 
5.2.11. Retail uses within the PSCs are predominantly comparison and convenience 
uses and the City Corporation considers that this predominance should continue , 
supported by other town centre uses that provide activity at street level and create 
a welcoming and attractive environment for people to shop, access services and 
spend leisure time . 
5.2.12. Following c hanges to the Use Classes Order introduced in September 2020, 
existing shops, premises providing financial and professional services to the public, 
and restaurants and cafes could be converted to a range of other Class E 
commercial, business and service uses without planning permission, unless there 
are specific planning conditions attached to a site which prevent this. Where 
planning permission is r equired for changes between retail uses, the City 
Corporation will require the provision of active retail frontages onto the street and 
will also assess the contribution the unit makes to the character of the PSC as a 
whole and its frontage; for example, retail units that are large or in prominent 
locations should be retained in retail use. The net loss of ground floor retail uses to 
non-retail uses within the identified PSC frontages could compromise the vitality of 
the PSCs and will be resisted.

      How the policy works 
5.2.13. Proposals for additional retail development in the PSCs should incorporate a 
range of unit sizes and frontage lengths to help provide a more diverse retail offer , 
whilst retaining a predominance of comparison and convenience shopping uses . 
Retail uses can generate significant numbers of delivery trips and retail 
development proposals will be required to demonstrate how delivery and servicing 
requirements have been addressed in the design process. 
5.2.14. Each PSC in the City has an individual char acter , which is described below, and 
will be considered in the implementation of policy: 
Cheapside 
5.2.15. Cheapside is currently the largest PSC in the City and serves a wider catchment 
area than the other centres. The PSC includes Bow Lane , the ground floor of O ne 
New Change , Cheapside and Poultry . The PSC has undergone significant 
redevelopment since 2011 and the strategy is to reinforce its role and character as 
the City’s ‘High Street’, maintaining a clear predominance of retail units with a 
focus on compariso n goods and food and drinks provision. There is scope for 
greater weekend trading and for some additional retail floorspace, particularly to 
link the western part of Cheapside with Culture Mile . The City Corporation will work 
with the Cheapside Business Al liance to promote Cheapside as a shopping, 
business and visitor destination and to support its evolution into a seven day a 
week destination. Timed restrictions on vehicular access to Bank Junction and the 
potential for future public realm improvements provide an opportunity to achieve 
greater pedestrian movement and retail links between Cheapside and retail activity 
within the Royal Exchange and further east. 
Fleet Street 
5.2.16. Fleet Street is the smallest PSC and predominantly serve s the needs of nearby 
workers and residents with a limited number of premises open in the evenings or at 
weekends. The PSC has a linear form and the busy road creates a poor 
environment and acts as a barrier to pedestrian permeability. Improvements to the 
public realm would help to improve the environment and the visitor and shopper 
experience. The current retail stock is largely food retail, and there is an 
opportunity to capitalise on the comparatively lower rents . Fleet Street’s 
outstanding heritage offers opportunities to develop a more distinctive retail mix in 
this PSC. There is some capacity for additional retail provision between Fleet 
Street and Holborn and there is scope to strengthen retail links with Cheapside. 
Leadenhall Market 
5.2.17. Leadenhall Marke t PSC is centred on the iconic Victorian market building, but 
includes several surrounding streets. The PSC is located within the southern part 
of the City Cluster which accommodates a significant and growing proportion of the 
City’s workforce. The histori c Grade II * listed market building is a tourist destination 
and so evening and week -end trading is encouraged. The character and 
significance of the historic market will be maintained and enhanced as a visitor and 
retail destination, supporting a flexible range of retail uses with an emphasis on

     food and beverage . Increased demand arising from the expanding City Cluster 
workforce will be met through larger, modern units in the surrounding streets which 
act as gateways to the market. Additional retail will b e provided by active retail 
frontages to new office development in the area. 
Moorgate/ Liverpool Street 
5.2.18. Moorgate/ Liverpool Street PSC is the second largest in the City but has a 
relative under -provision of comparison goods space compared to the City averag e. 
Retail demand in this PSC will increase due to the improved connectivity arising 
from the Elizabeth Line and development in and around Broadgate, supported by 
further retail provision along routes between Liverpool Street and Moorgate 
stations. There is potential for the PSC to expand its 7 -day a week role, capitalising 
on its strong transport accessibility, its proximity for inner London residents and to 
nearby visitor and cultural attractions such as the Culture Mile, Old Spitalfields 
Market and Pettic oat Lane. 
Policy RE2: Retail Links 
Within the Retail Links, the net loss of active frontage s and floorspace will be resisted , 
including the loss of retail facilities, and additional retail development will be supported. 
A mix of retail and town centre uses will be encouraged in the Retail Links, ensuring that 
the location and balance of uses does not adversely affect the function of the Link, any 
nearby PSC or their s urrounding areas. 
Reason for the policy 
5.2.19. Retail Links provide City workers and residents with important services and 
leisure facilities and are typically along some of the busiest pedestrian routes . Their 
purpose is to connect the City’s PSCs and to provide connections to neighbouring 
boroughs’ retail frontages, transport hubs, areas with high footfall and residential 
areas.  Retail Links are a key part of the 40% of the City’s existing retail stock 
found outside of the PSCs and they play a significant role in meeting demand 
particularly for day -to-day retail goods and services. 
How the policy works 
5.2.20. The Retail Needs Assessment identified the need for approximately 85,000m2 of 
additional retail floorspace in the ‘rest of the City’ outside the PSCs. The 
Assessm ent highlighted two areas that should be a priority for new floorspace 
outside the PSCs: Farringdon/Culture Mile and Eastcheap/Monument. Delivery of 
new retail floorspace at Eastcheap/Monument could help to meet some of the 
demand arising from office devel opment in the City Cluster which cannot be 
accommodated within the Leadenhall Market PSC and would provide more vibrant 
links towards the Pool of London. 
5.2.21. While the Retail Needs Assessment concluded that the Retail Links continue to 
play an important role i n meeting demand, it advocated a different occupier mix in 
these areas compared to the PSCs in order to avoid drawing visitors away from the 
prime PSC streets. Comparison goods shopping should continue to be focused in 
the PSCs to maintain the health of th e City’s core retail offer. 
82  
 
     
   
  
    
          
  
     
   
   
     
  
   
 
  
  
  
     
  
    
  
  
  
    
     
  
    
 
   
   
   
 
   
 
  
 
  
  5.2.22. While the mix of uses in the Links should include comparison and convenience 
shops, a variety of other retail and town centre uses will be permitted, where there 
is no detrimental or cumulative effect on the amenity of neighbouring residential or 
business premises, such as through litter, noise, disturbance and odours . All 
development in the Retail Links should incorporate active frontages at street level. 
Policy RE3: Ground floor retail provision elsewhere in the City 
Retail  uses will be encouraged at ground floor level across the City provid ed they: 
• include active frontages onto the street; 
• do not impact adversely on the amenity of residents, workers and visitors; 
• do not impact adversely on the operation of office premises; and 
• would not adversely affect the vitality and viability of the PSCs or Retail Links. 
2. The loss of convenience retail units that meet a local residential need will be resisted 
unless it is demonstrated that they are no longer required. 
Reason for the policy 
5.2.23. Retail units outside of PSCs and Retail Links provide local facilities for the City’s 
workforce, enhance the City’s vibrancy, and may serve the City’s residential 
communities. Given that most of the City’s retail provision is tailored towards City 
workers, it is important to retain units such as convenience stores that are within 
easy walking distance of the residential areas and meet the day to day needs of 
surrounding communities. Unless they are subject to specific planning conditions, 
such units could be converted to any Class E commercial, business and service 
use witho ut planning permission. 
How the policy works 
5.2.24. The provision of new retail units, particularly comparison and convenience units, 
at ground floor level in existing and new development will be encouraged where 
these units do not have an adverse impact on the o peration of office premises, 
provide an active frontage onto the street and do not have an adverse impact on 
the amenity of residents, workers or visitors by reason of noise, smells or fumes 
from the operation of the unit or servicing and deliveries. Use o f ground floors for 
retail provides the opportunity to create more permeable buildings which can assist 
in reducing pressure for space on City streets.

   Policy RE4: Specialist Retail Uses 
The City Corporation will seek to retain specialist retail uses and premises that are 
historically and culturally significant to the City of London. 
Reason for the policy 
5.2.25. Within the City, there are some specialist retail uses and premises that cannot 
be found elsewhere, such as the historic Royal Exchange and the London Silver 
Vaults on Chancery Lane. These uses contribute to the City’s visitor economy and 
to its cultural distinctiveness and should be retained and promoted. 
How the policy works 
5.2.26. The City Corporation will work with owners, developers and occupiers to retain 
specialist retail uses and premises where it can be demonstrated that such uses 
are of historical or cultural significance. The City Corporation may attach conditions 
to planning permissions to ensure the retention or replacement of specialist facilities on the same site where they are impacted by development proposals. 
Policy RE5: Markets 
Proposals for markets and temporary retail pop-ups will be encouraged where they: 
• are of an appropriate scale and frequency for their location; 
• would not have a significant adverse impact on the vitality and viability of 
existing retail centres within or outside the City; 
• would not have a significant adverse impact on the amenity of nearby residents or business occupiers; 
• would not unduly obstruct pedestrian and vehicular movement; and 
• would not involve the permanent loss of open space or harm the character of that space. 
Reason for the policy 
5.2.27. There is an increasing demand for temporary retail pop-ups and street food 
markets, such as the Guildhall Yard Lunch Market, which can support the local economy by generating increased vibrancy, retail diversity and footfall. These uses provide greater retail choice, enliven the public realm and increase the attractiveness of the City as a place to live, work and visit. Pop-up and meanwhile uses can minimise vacancies of retail premises while a long-term occupier is sought, and may be used to animate areas where construction works are taking 
place. 
84  
 
    
   
 
  
     
  
    
     
  
   
     
 
      5.2.28. Street trading in the City is regulated by the City Corporation under the City of 
London Various Powers Act 1987 (as amended), which restricts permanent street 
trading but allows street trading to take place for temporary periods in specified locations. The exception is on Middlesex Street (Petticoat Lane) Market, which straddles the boundary between the City and Tower Hamlets, where licensed trading is permitted between 9am and 2pm on Sundays. Further information on licensing requirements is set out in the City Corporation’s Street Trading Policy which is available on the Corporation’s website. 
5.2.29. Temporary street trading, where permitted under the Various Powers Act, can 
operate for up to 14 days in a calendar year under permitted development rights. Trading for longer periods will require planning permission. Market trading off City streets but within the curtilage of a building will similarly require planning permission if undertaken for a period of more than 14 days in a calendar year. 
How the policy works 
5.2.30. Proposals for markets or temporary retail pop- ups located within a building or its 
curtilage, should be ancillary to and complement the main use of the site. When 
assessing proposals for new permanent markets and opportunities for pop-ups, the 
City Corporation will consider the potential for significant adverse impacts on the 
trade of retailers occupying fixed units within the vicinity, together with impacts on the amenity of nearby residents or business occupiers, on pedestrian and vehicular 
movement or on open spaces.

 5.3. Culture, Visitors and the Night-Time Economy 
Context 
5.3.1. London has long been recognised as one of the world’s great cultural cities . The 
City of London contains a huge concentration of arts and cultural facilities, which 
contribute to its uniqueness and complement its primary business function. These 
facilities include galleries, theatres, museums, heritage attractions, Livery Halls, 
libraries, places of worship and c oncert halls. In recent years a growing number of 
night -time entertainment facilities such as clubs, bars and event venues have 
located in the City, alongside the traditional historic public houses . Research 
undertaken for the City Corporation shows that growth in creative industries in the 
City between 2010 and 2016 has outpaced growth elsewhere in London and the 
UK. 
5.3.2. The City’s cultural offer is an integral element of the Square Mile, alongside the 
business City . The Barbi can is identified as a strategic night -time location of 
national or international significance while Cheapsi de and Liverpool Street are 
identified as night -time areas of more than local significance in the London Plan . 
The City Corporation has ambitious pl ans for Culture Mile , as explained in the Key 
Areas of Change section. 
5.3.3. The City Corporation has prepared Visitor and Cultural Strategies that promote 
the City as a high-quality visitor destination with an emphasis on world -class 
cultural facilities. It is estimated there are approximately 21.5 million business and 
leisure visits a year to the City and this is expected to grow as a result of an 
increased cultural offer and improv ements to transport accessibility such as the 
Elizabeth Line and Bank Station upgrade . Suitable facilities and hotel 
accommodation are required to provide visitors with a pleasant experience whilst in 
the City. 
5.3.4. Cultural and creative activity can contribut e significantly to the quality of the 
environment and cultural experience, particularly where it enhances a sense of 
place. Public art can giv e visual pleasure and help to re-establish local identity and 
sense of place. 
Strategic Policy S 6: Culture, Visit ors and the Night -Time Economy 
The City Corporation will maintain and enhance the City of London’s contribution to 
London’s world -class cultural offer and the City’s communities will be able to access a 
range of arts, heritage and cultural experiences by: 
• Providing, supporting , encouraging access to and further developing a wide 
range of creative and cultural spaces and facilities across the City, and 
delivering a major destination for culture and creativity in the north west of the 
City through the Culture Mile initiative ; 
• Requiring developers to submit Cultural Plans for major development outlining 
how the development will contribute to the enrichment and enhancement of 
the City’s cultural offer; 
86  
 
       
    
  
    
   
  
   
  
     
    
   
   
  
  
     
  
  
  
    
     
  
    
  
    
  
     
   
   
  
      
  
  
       
    
   
  
    
  
   
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  • Protecting and enhancing existing cultural buildings and facilities where a 
continuing need exists and ensuring there is no overall loss of cultural facilities 
or diversity in the City ; 
• Supporting the development of creative enterprise through appropriate 
workspace and digital infrastructure, particularly within Culture Mile; 
• Allowing hotel development where it supports the primary business or cultural 
role of the City , and refusing new hotels where they would compromise the 
City’s business function or the potential for future business growth ; 
• Enabling a vibrant evening and night -time economy, while ensuring that 
operators proactively manage night -time entertainment premises to minimise 
potential impact to residents and workers ; 
• Maintaining the City’s existing collection of public art and cultur ally significant 
objects and pursuing opportunities to commission new, high quality pieces in 
appropriate locations ; and 
• Maintaining and enhancing the City’s open spaces and /or streetscape to 
accommodate cultural events and activities that are accessible t o all City 
communities and which celebrate the City’s unique cultural offer. 
Reason for the policy 
5.3.5. The City’s cultural infrastructure is important to the distinctive and historically 
significant character of the Square Mile. The international reputation and high 
quality of this cultural activity has a critical part to play in the vibrancy of the 
working environment and adds to the appeal of the City as a place to do business. 
It attract s an increasing number of visitors, with consequent econom ic benefits , and 
supports the mental, spiritual and physical well-being of residents and workers. 
5.3.6. The City Corporation ’s Cultural Strategy highlights that commerce and creativity 
thrive side by side and sets out a vision to position the City as a world capital for 
commerce and culture . The Strategy embraces a definition of culture that is broad 
and inclusive ; it recognises that culture exists both in the buildings and heritage of 
the City’s institutions a nd in the streets and informal spaces in between. Culture is 
seen as being for everyone and is a driver of social mobility . 
How the policy works 
5.3.7. The City Corporation will require proposals for new development and changes of 
use to protect existing arts and c ultural facilities where they are needed and where 
necessary require appropriate replacement . The City Corporation will work with 
developer s and cultural and arts institutions to deliver new facilities where they 
support the City’s Culture Mile ambition or enhance the attractiveness of the City 
as a business and cultural destination. 
5.3.8. Developers will be required to submit Cultural Plans as part of planning 
applications for major developments . These should set out how the development 
will contribute towards enriching and enhancing the City’s creative and cultural 
offer for example by incorporating cultural activities or displays in ground floor 
87  
 
       
   
   
    
  
   
 
 
   
      
    
   
 
   
  
    
    
  
    
    
  
      
   
   
   
       
   
     
   
   
     
   
   
   
   
     
   
 
   
  
 
 
 spaces; facilitating public access and providing exhibitions /interpretation boards in 
relation to matters of historic interest; providing permanent or temporary space for 
creative enterprises ; and inc orporating public art either within the design of the 
building or as freestanding structures. 
Policy CV1: Protection of Existing Visitor, Arts and Cultural Facilities 
1. The City Corporation will resist t he loss of existing visitor, arts , and cultural facilities , 
unless: 
• replacement facilities of at l east equivalent quality are provided on -site or 
within the vicinity which meet the needs of the City’s communities; or 
• the use can be delivered from other facilities without leading to or increasing 
any shortfall in provision and it has been demonstrated that there is no 
demand for another similar use o n the site; or 
• it has been demonstrated that there is no realistic prospect of the premises 
being used for a similar purpose in the foreseeable future. 
2. Proposals resulting in the loss of visitor, arts and cultural facilities must be 
accompanied by evidence of the lack of need for those facilities. Loss of facilities 
will only be permitted where this would facilitate the overall enhance ment of visitor, 
arts or cultural provision within the vicinity or where it has been demonstrated that 
the existing facility has been actively marketed for its current or an alternative 
visitor, arts or cultural use at reasonable terms for such a use. 
Reason for the p olicy 
5.3.9. The vibrancy of the City ’s cultural offer depends on a broad network of arts and 
cultural organisa tions and facilities, and it is important that there is sufficient 
floorspace available to accommodate these uses. There is strong comp etition for 
buildings and sites from commercial uses in the City so it will be necessary to 
demonstrate that a n existing arts or cultural use is no longer needed before a site 
will be allowed to change use. 
5.3.10. There are many cultural facilities that are unique to the City and maintain an 
historic or cultural association with the Square Mile. Special consideration needs to 
be given to the protection of these facilities to maintain the City’s unique cultural 
heritage. Examples of such facilities include City Livery Halls , public house s which 
have a heritage, cultural, economic or social value to local communities , theatres, 
museums , churches, and specialist retail premises such as the Silver Vaults in 
Chancery Lane . 
5.3.11. Some cultural facilities fall within broad categories of land use under the Use 
Classes Order, enabling the change of use of any one land use to another within 
that class without requiring planning permission. For instance, museums, places of 
worship and exhibition halls all fall within Use Class F.1 (Learning and non -
residential institutions). However, other uses such as theatres, concert halls and 
public houses are classed as sui generis, meaning that planning permission would 
be required to change them to any alternative use. 
88  
 
   
    
  
  
    
  
  
  
 
  
   
    
 
    
  
 
    
     
       
    
    
 
  
       
   
      
  
  
 
   
 
  
    
  
   
   
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 How the policy works 
5.3.12. Applicants will be required to demonstrate that an existing visitor, arts or cultural 
facility has been marketed and that there is no reasonable interest from relevant 
organisations. Information should be included which sets out the length of time the 
proper ty or site has been marketed; the number of viewings ; the comments from 
prospective purchasers or tenants (including reference regarding the suitability of 
continued visitor, arts or cultural use). Marketing will not be required if it can be 
demonstrated t hat the loss of a facility is part of a business plan to deliver 
improvements to another similar facility nearby. 
5.3.13. The City Corporation has published guidelines for determining nominations for 
Assets of Community Value in the City of London, which include local criteria to 
assess the role of public houses in furthering social wellbeing or social interest. In 
determining whether a public house has heritage, cultural, economic or social 
value, the City Corporation will have regard to those gu idelines a s well a s the 
characteristics outlined in the London Plan. 
Policy CV2: Provision of Visitor Facilities 
The provision of facilities that meet the needs of visitors in new cultural developments 
and in nearby open spaces and the public realm will be encouraged , including : 
• Seating and tables ; 
• structures and landscaping to enable children’s play and provide facilities for 
school groups; 
• suitable shelter from weather conditions; 
• well-designed public convenience provision , including changing places toilets , 
accessible to all users ; 
• well-designed signage, way finding and links to visitor facilities and 
destinations ; 
• temporary pop -up art installations, galleries and spaces in appropriate 
locations: 
• performance spaces and animation of key routes where appropriate. 
Reason for the policy 
5.3.14. The City attracts large numbers of tourists in certain locations such as around 
St. Paul’s Cathedral and near the Tower of London . This is expected to grow with 
new attractions such as the proposed relocated Museum of London in Smithfield 
attracti ng increased numbers of visitors. It is important that the City of London can 
offer a range of facilities and events which meet the needs of these visitors whilst 
creati ng a distinctive look and feel for the City. 
89  
 
   
  
   
   
  
   
 
   
    
   
  
   
 
     
  
    
 
     
 
  
   
    
  
 
  
   
     
  
    
  
   
 
    
   
  
 
 
   
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
  How the policy works 
5.3.15. The City Corporation will work with developers and arts and culture institutions 
to ensure that new developments and open spaces near tourist attractions provide 
facilities that improve th e experience for visitors and cater for how visitors use the 
space . These facilities must be capable of being accommodated without detracting 
from the setting of the relevant tourist attraction , the wider townscape or residential 
amenity . 
Policy CV3: Hotel s 
1. Proposals for hotels and other visitor accommodation will be permitted where they: 
• do not result in the loss of viable office accommodation for which there is 
continuing need, as set out in Policy OF2; 
• do not result in adverse impacts on the amenity of neighbouring occupiers, 
including cumulative impacts; 
• include a range of complementary facilities accessible to the public ; 
• provide satisfactory arrangements for pick -up/drop -off, service delivery 
vehicle s, waste storage , and taxis, appropriate to the size and nature of the 
development; 
• are inclusive, meeting London Plan accessibility standards for new hotel 
bedrooms ; 
• ensure continuing beneficial use for historic buildings, including enhanced 
public acces s to and interpretation of that heritage , where appropriate ; and 
• address the sustainability challenges associated with the City’ s BREEAM 
priorities ( energy, water , pollution and materials). 
Reason for the policy 
5.3.16. While the majority of visitors are day -trippers, the City has seen strong demand 
for hotel accommodation in the last ten years, and in 2020 had 44 hotels, apart -
hotels and hostels , providing over 6,700 bedrooms . The GLA has forecast the need 
for an additio nal 58,146 bedrooms in London between 2015 and 2041. This 
demand is driven by a projected increase of 42 million international visitor nights 
and a 15 million increase in domestic visitor nights. The City’s projected share of 
this increase is 4,341 rooms. Based on past trends and hotel sites currently 
permitted or under construction, there is a strong likelihood that the City will meet 
the London Plan requirement . It should be noted that these GLA forecasts predate 
the Covid -19 pandemic but although there h ave been short term impacts on the 
tourism industry, the attractions of the City and of London as a visitor destination 
remain strong. 
5.3.17. Hotel accommodation is important to cater for business visitors wishing to stay 
in the City, as well as leisure visitors. The amount of office floorspace will increase 
significantly in the next 20 years and the demand for business accommodation is 
90  
 
      
   
   
 
      
  
    
  
  
 
   
    
   
  
   
   
 
    
  
     likely to increase. Visitor numbers are projected to increase, and the developm ent 
of Culture Mile is likely to increase demand for hotel accommodation particularly in 
the north west of the City . 
Figure 10: Hotel and visitor attractions distribution 
How the policy works 
5.3.18. Policy CV3 applies to hotels, apart -hotels and serviced apar tments. 
5.3.19. Hotel development should not prejudice the primary business function of the City 
by displacing sites that are suitable for office accommodation. Hotel proposals will 
need to demonstrate that there would not be a loss of suitable and viable office 
floorspace, in accordance with Policy OF2 and the Office Use SPD. 
5.3.20. Hotel development may be suited to listed buildings, providing an alternative use 
which could enable significant heritage features to be conserved and enhanced. 
Where such change of use is p roposed, the City Corporation will seek improved 
public access to and interpretation of the building’s heritage. 
5.3.21. Hotels can cause amenity issues for surrounding occupiers, for example through 
noise nuisance or traffic and servicing impacts. New hotel propo sals will be 
expected to prioritise access by walking, cycling and public transport. The location 
of entrances and exits, drop -off points and servicing and delivery arrangements will 
be considered in the context of surrounding occupiers. Where new hotels a re 
91  
 
    
 
  
   
   
   
   
   
  
  
   
      
  
      
     
    
      
 
    
   
   
     
  
   
    
    
  
   
   
  
    
    
   
    
  
 
  
      
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 considered to be acceptable, they should enable the public to access facilities such 
as co -working space, meeting rooms, restaurants or leisure facilities in order to 
bring the maximum benefit to the City’s communities. 
5.3.22. Apart -hotels and serviced accommodation often display characteristics more 
associated with permanent, self -contained housing. Some are more akin to hotels 
in the type of services they provide but may result in different impacts. Apart -
hotels/serviced apartments may therefore fall within the C1 or C3 Use Classes, 
depending on their characteristics . Factors that may affect the Use Class include; 
• Presence of on -site staff/management ; 
• Presence of reception, bar or restaurant ; 
• Provision of cleaning and administrative servic es; 
• Ownership of units/ability to sell on open market ; and 
• Minimum/maximum lease lengths . 
5.3.23. Where apart -hotels and serviced apartments are considered to fall within the C3 
(dwelling houses) Use Class, proposals will be assessed in accordance with the 
housing policies in this Plan including the requirement for affordable housing 
policies . Conditions will be used to ensure units are subject to minimum lease 
lengths. 
5.3.24. For proposals within the C1 (Hotels) Use Class, planning conditions will be 
considered to ensure that units would not be used or occupied by permanent 
households as this would reduce the availability of accommodation for short -term 
visitors to the City and may prejudice the business City and put pressure on local 
services and infr astructure. Conditions will therefore be used to ensure units are 
subject to maximum lease lengths (typically 90 days). 
Policy CV4: Evening and Night -Time Economy 
1. Proposals for new evening and night -time entertainment and related uses and the 
extension of existing premises will be permitted where it can be demonstrated that, 
either individually or cumulatively, there is no unacceptable impact on: 
• the amenity of residents and other noise -sensitive uses; 
• environmental amenity, taking account of the potential for noise, disturbance , 
waste and odours arising from the operation of the premises, customers 
arriving at and leaving the premises and the servicing of the premises. 
2. Applicants will be required to submit Management Statements detailing how these 
issues w ill be addressed during the operation of the premises and are encouraged to 
engage with nearby residential and commercial occupiers . 
3. Where new residential development is proposed close to existing evening or night -
time uses, the residential development will only be permitted if it includes suitable 
measures to mitigate potential disturbance and noise and air quality issues for 
prospective residents.

   Reason for policy 
5.3.25. Evening and n ight-time entertainment is becoming an important part of the City’s 
economy, bolstered by London’s move toward becoming a 24-hour destination, 
growing numbers of workers and visitors , and the encouragement of arts and 
culture in the City. Expansion of the City’s evening and night -time offer will be 
encouraged where it is compatible with neighbouring uses . Night-time 
entertainment has the potential to cause noise disturbance to nearby residents as 
well as other impacts such as anti -social behaviour , litter and odours. These 
adverse impacts need to be mitigated. 
5.3.26. Anti-social behaviour can potentially be reduced by provid ing a broad range of 
evening and night -time activities that appeal to different customers , rather than 
concentrating one type of use in a particular area . This includes extending the 
opening hours of existing day -time facilities such as s hops , cafes and leisure 
facilities, which can promote customer cross -over and create bridges between the 
day-time and night -time economy . 
How the policy works 
5.3.27. The City Corporation will require the development responsible for change to 
manag e the impact of that change – the ‘Agent of Change’ principle . This means 
that a new residential development built near to an existing night -time 
entertainment use would be re sponsible for providing appropriate soundproofing or 
other mitigation measures to avoid any undue impact , whereas a new night -time 
entertainment use opening in a residential area would be responsible for the 
necessary mitigation measures. 
5.3.28. Night -time ente rtainment uses in the City include restaurants and cafes, drinking 
establishments, hot food takeaways and other related uses including, for example, 
a nightclub or a mix of such uses. They form part of the City’s wider night -time 
economy . 
5.3.29. The management of night -time entertainment and licensed premises is 
undertaken through the operation of both planning and licensing regimes. In 
general, the planning regime controls the location, design and planning use of 
premises to protect the amenity of an area or loca l residents, whilst the licensing 
regime is used, having regard to licensing objectives, to control specific activities at 
premises to prevent, for example, noise and other public nuisance . Changes to the 
Use Classes Order in 2020 allow flexibility for commercial premises including 
offices and shops to become restaurants and cafes without requiring planning 
permission. Licensing and environmental health legislation would need to be 
applied to address any potential nuisance to nearby occup iers in these 
circumstances, albeit that planning permission would be required for any physical 
works such as ventilation equipment associated with a restaurant or café use. 
5.3.30. Planning and licensing regimes operate under separate legislative and 
regulator y frameworks. The City Corporation will ensure that, as far as is possible, 
a complementary approach is taken between planning and licensing within the 
legislative framework.  The City Corporation publishes a Statement of Licensing 
93  
 
    
 
  
  
 
   
    
 
    
    
  
    
    
 
   
   
  
    
      
   
      
 
  
 
    
   
   
   
  
 
   
    
   
 
   
   
    
  
 
 
 
 
 Policy, which outlines the approach that it will take when considering applications 
for the sale and supply of alcohol, the provision of regulated entertainment and the 
provision of late -night refreshment. This is supported by the City Corporation’s 
Code of Good Practice for Li censed Premises. The City Corporation ’s Noise 
Strategy sets the strategic direction for noise policy within the City of London and 
outlines steps that the City Corporation will take, and is already taking, in dealing 
with noise issues, including those aris ing from night -time entertainment. 
5.3.31. The character of many licensed premises has changed significantly in recent 
years.  Existing and new premises often have longer operating hours, may have 
larger capacity and may provide live or recorded amplified music. Some of these 
premises are close to residential accommodation and this can result in disturbance 
and nuisance from excessive noise, particularly from people drinking and smoking 
outside, and arriving or leaving. Policy SA2 (Dispersal Routes ) requires 
appli cation s for night -time uses to include M anagement Statements setting out 
proposals for the dispersal of patrons . 
5.3.32. All planning applications for restaurants and cafes, where planning permission is 
required, and for drinking establishments, hot food takeaway s and related , uses 
should include information stating the proposed hours of operation. The City 
Corporation may impose conditions requiring the closure of the premises between 
the hours of 11pm and 7am where appropriate , such as near noise sensitive uses. 
5.3.33. Potential applicants seeking planning permission for a night -time entertainment 
use, between the hours of 11pm and 7am, are expected to engage at the earliest 
possible stage with the City Corporation as Licensing Authority, the City of Lond on 
Police, local residents and other neighbouring occupiers that will be affected by the 
proposal. This will ensure that the local context and local sensitivities are fully 
understood and can be taken into account when designing premises for night -time 
entertainment uses and planning the operation of the proposed use to minimise 
adverse impact on amenity. Policies HL3 and HS3 deal with noise and light 
pollution , and the residential environment respectively . 
5.3.34. Proposals for new and extended night -time entertai nment uses or for variations 
of planning conditions must be accompanied by a Management Statement that 
addresses planning amenity issues, sets out how potential impacts on amenity will 
be addressed through the design of the premises and how they will opera te without 
causing disturbance including: 
• hours of closure to protect amenity; 
• noise mitigation plans related to both internal and external noise, including 
measures to reduce sound transfer, such as soundproofing , noise controls and 
double entry lobbies; 
• the dispersal of patrons so as not to cause disturbance to residents; 
• arrangements for the storage, handling and disposal of waste; 
• a timed programme for deliveries and collections and other servicing 
arrangements;

 • measures to deal with the emission of odo urs; and 
• location of ventilation ducts and plant. 
5.3.35. Assessment of the Management Statement will have regard to the City Noise 
Strategy, the provisions of the City of London Statement of Licensing Policy and to 
any submitted licence application operating sc hedule. It is recognised that it may 
not be possible to submit detailed Management Statements when details of the end 
use operator are not known. However, applicants should submit an outline 
Management Statement which consider s physical design measures to minimise 
disturbance , such as those outlined in the paragraph above . In such cases, 
conditions will be attached to any planning permissions granted requiring full 
Management Statements to be submitted once the occupier s are known. 
5.3.36. To safeguard quiet times and amenity, particularly for residents and other noise -
sensitive uses, the City Corporation will attach planning conditions or seek s106 
planning obligations to ensure compliance with agreed Management Statements. 
The City Corporation will normally apply conditions to limit the hours of operation 
where there is potential for unacceptable disturbance to local residents and others.  
Each case will be considered in relation to its locality and the need to strike a 
balance between the benefits to the City of night -time entertainment and the risk of 
disturbance to local residents, workers and others. 
Policy CV5: Public Art 
1. The City’s public realm and distinctive identity will be enhanced by: 
• encouraging the provision of new artworks in appropriate locations in the City 
on public and private land; 
• protecting existing works of art and other objects of cultural significance ; 
• ensuring that financial provision is made for the future maintenance of new 
public art; 
• requiring the appropriate rei nstatement or re -siting of art works and other 
objects of cultural significance when buildings are redeveloped. 
2. The location of new and relocated artworks must take into consideration the health 
and safety of pedestrians , particul arly those with disabiliti es, and other road users . 
Reason for the policy 
5.3.37. Art can contribute significantly to the quality of the environment, particularly 
where it enhances a sense of place and local identity and is a form of community 
infrastructure . Public art includes temporary installations and non-physical works 
such as soundscapes. 
95  
 
       
    
    
   
       
     
  
   
 
  
    
   
   
 
  
    
 
   
    
    
   
       
 
 
  
     
 
     
  5.3.38. Where appropriate , artworks can be multi -functional so that a variety of 
community needs can be met. Artworks may provide shelter from the weather , 
include sensory elements and provide play opportunities. 
5.3.39. There are several arts events held regularly in the City including Sculpture in the 
City which forms a free public trail of works of art throughout the City. 
5.3.40. The proposed public art must respect, and not detract from, the surrounding 
environment. Objects of cultural significance may include blue plaques, statues, 
monuments, fountains, memorials, parish boundary markers and other similar 
heritage assets. 
5.3.41. Works of art must ensure that health and safety considerations are cons idered 
when designing, siting and maintaining the installation. Restriction of pedestrian 
flows must be avoided, and consideration given to ensuring that people with visual 
or mobility impairments are not placed in danger. Illuminated artworks must be 
sited to avoid light pollution impacting on nearby residential occupiers. 
How the policy works 
5.3.42. The City Arts Initiative (CAI) group advises the City Corporation on the artistic 
merit, siting, setting and appropriateness of public art proposals in the City. 
Temporary works of art (in situ for less than 8 weeks) , which do not require 
planning permission, will be considered by the CAI group. 
5.3.43. Opportunities for public art in open spaces should be considered at an early 
stage to ensure t hat they are satisfactorily integrated into the design of 
development and applicants should work with artists at an early stage of design . 
Where works of public art are sited in the public realm, they should be endowed to 
secure their appropriate maintenan ce in perpetuity and their retention will be 
secured by condition or legal agreement. Where works of art are on private land, it 
is expected that those pieces will be maintained to a high standard by the 
landowner . The City Corporation may seek contributions through s106 obligations 
towards the provision of new public art and the future maintenance of public art.

 5.4. Smart Infrastructure and Utilities 
Context 
5.4.1. The City of London relies on a range of utilities to function as a global financial , 
business and cultural centre and to meet the needs of its businesses, workers and 
residents. There are challenges to providing the infrastructure required to support 
existing activity in the City and to provide the infrastructure necessary to de liver the 
level of growth envisaged in the period up to 2036. At the same time, new 
developments and existing occupiers can actively minimise their demands on 
infrastructure, utilities and services to ensure that the City can become a more 
sustainable plac e to work, live and visit. 
5.4.2. Utilities infrastructure comprises the provision of electricity, gas, water, sewerage, 
sustainable drainage (SuDS ), telecommunications, including wired and wireless 
infrastructure, decentralised energy networks and the pipe subway networks that 
accommodate such infrastructure. 
Strategic Policy S 7: Smart Infrastructure and Utilities 
1. To coordinate and facilitate infras tructure planning and delivery all development 
should : 
• Minimise the demand for power, water and utility services; 
• Incorporate sustainable building design and demand management measures; 
• Connect to existing pipe subways where feasible, particularly where t here is 
pipe and cable congestion under the streets; 
• Seek to provide the latest and best quality utility infrastructure and connections 
to serve the development; 
2. Developers must engage with infrastructure providers at an early stage of design to 
ensure th at the infrastructure needs arising from the construction and operation of 
new development are addressed and required utility networks and connections are in 
place in time to serve the development. 
3. Existing essential utilities and telecommunications infrastructure will be protected 
from development unless it is no longer required or will be adequately relocated. 
4. The improvement and extension of utilities infrastructure should be designed and 
sited to minimise adverse impacts on t he visual amenity, character and appearance 
of the City and its heritage assets. 
Reason for th e policy 
5.4.3. There are specific challenges to providing the infrastructure needed to support 
existing activity in the City and the additional infrastructure necessar y to support 
the scale of development set out in this Plan : 
97  
 
   
 
  
  
 
    
    
 
  
  
    
   
 
 
  
  
  
   
 
   
    
  
 
  
  
    
  
 
    
   
   
 
  
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 • The dense concentration of business activity in the City means that high 
demand is concentrated in a small geographical area. 
• There is a legacy of congested cable routes under the City’s streets. 
• Delivery of new infrastructure and improvements to existing networks may 
result in temporary disruption to businesses, residents and visitors. 
• Energy and telecoms demands are increasing and there is a need to 
continually improve and upgrade networ ks to meet this changing demand in a 
sustainable way, wh ich does not compromise the City’s trajectory towards zero 
carbon . 
How the policy works 
5.4.4. The City Corporation has established strong links with the various infrastructure 
providers that service the City, including Thames Water, UK Power Networks, 
Cadent Gas, Citigen and telecoms providers. The City Corporation will seek to 
retain and strengthen these links , workin g with all providers and regulators, where 
appropriate . Developers will be required to demonstrate liaison with infrastructure 
providers at an early stage of building design , ensuring that future needs are 
planned and delivered in a timely fashion with min imal disturbance to City streets, 
businesses and residents. 
Policy IN1: Infrastructure provision and connection 
1. Utility infrastructure and connections must be designed into and integrated with the 
development. The following infrastructure requirements sho uld be planned for: 
• Electricity, gas and water supply necessary for the operation of the intended 
use and during the construction period. Account should be taken of the need 
to conserve resources and deliver energy and water efficient buildings to 
minimise future demands. Temporary Building Supply for the construction 
phase should be identified in conjunction with electricity providers including the 
estimated load capacity, substations and route for supply ; 
• Heating and cooling demand and viability of provision via decentralised energy 
networks. Designs must incorporate connections to existing decentralised 
energy networks where feasible ; 
• Digital and telecommunications network demand, including full fibre wired and 
wireless infrastructure in line wit h the Mayor of London’s ‘Wired Score’ 
connectivity rating or equivalent, planning for dual entry through communal 
entry chambers and flexibility to address future technological improvements ; 
• Separate surface and foul water drainage requirements within the proposed 
building or site, including provision of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), 
rainwater harvesting and grey -water recycling, minimising discharge to the 
combined sewer network. 
2. To avoid delays to prospective tenants, developers should consider pr e-installing 
fibre optic and other communications networks into the new development. 
98  
 
  
  
   
    
      
  
  
   
 
   
   
    
  
   
 
 
    
 
 
     
   
   
    
  
  
  
 
   
   
      
 
    
   
  
   
  
   
    3. Developers should conduct mobile signal tests within the development and consider 
the need for in -building mobile solutions where coverage is poor. 
4. Development should aim to avoid reducing mobile connectivity in surrounding areas , 
and if that is not possible suitable mitigation measures will be required . Provision 
should be made on buildings or in the public realm to accommodate well -designed 
and loca ted mobile digital infrastructure. 
Reason for the policy 
5.4.5. The dense concentration of businesses means that high demand is focused in a 
restricted geographical area. Electricity, telecommunications, water, gas and 
district heating and cooling network s are of particular importance. Congested cable 
routes traverse t he City under its streets. Energy demands are increasing, 
particularly to provide air conditioning to counter increased warming and the 
delivery of upgraded ICT networks required by financial and business services. The 
impact of Covid -19 has highlighted th e importance of digital connectivity. Recovery 
from the pandemic offers an opportunity to speed up the transition to a digital 
economy, accelerating the adoption of remote and home working, e -learning, e -
commerce and telemedicine. 
5.4.6. The City Corporation ’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan set s out in more detail the 
infrastructure projects that are under construction or required. 
How this policy works 
5.4.7. Developers must liaise with utility providers and adopt best practice in assess ing 
and improv ing connectivity within developments. Connection layouts and future 
proofing should be considered in the design of the development . 
5.4.8. Addressing a ir pollution is a fundamental concern for the City Corporation. 
Developers must engage with energy providers prior to commencement of 
development works to ensure t he availability of Temporary Building Supplies, 
avoiding the need for diesel generators to provide electricity. 
5.4.9. Delivery of new infrastructure and improvements to existing networks could resu lt 
in temporary disruption to businesses, residents and visitors. Developers must co-
operate with infrastructure providers to minimise disruption to highways and 
businesses during major infrastructure upgrades and pipe subway construction. 
5.4.10. It is essential for the City to be digitally connected and responsive to the 
changing requirements of business, equipping businesses to benefit from the 
digital transformation stimulated by the Covid -19 pandemic . Buildings must be 
equipped to meet the digital needs of cu rrent and future occupiers. Developers will 
be expected to undertake an assessment of the connectivity of major new office 
buildings or refurbishments, using a wired certification such as WiredScore. 
Development should result in an improvement in the City’ s digital connectivity . 
5.4.11. Mobile connectivity within and around buildings is critical to the City of London. 
Developers will need to ensure that their buildings do not worsen existing signal 
99  
 
     
 
    
  
     
   
  
 
  
    
   
   
  
 
  
 
  
     
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
   
      
     
    
  
    
    
    
 
 strength in the area and consider the provision of in -building solutions where signal 
strength is poor. The roll out of 5G across the City will require additional mobile 
infrastructure and suitably located cells . Where feasible , provision for new cells 
should be incorporated into new development. Where this is not feasible, provision 
should be made for additional cells to be located in the public realm, on existing 
street furniture or elsewhere as appropriate . 
5.4.12. The City Corporation will encourage the improvement and extension of utilities 
networks to ensure that the City uses the latest technology and continues to 
provide good quality services for businesses, residents, students and visitors. The 
City Corporation ’s ‘City Developer Guidelines for Incoming Utility Services’ 
provides guidance on best practice . 
Policy IN2: Infrastructure Capacity 
1. Development must not lead to capacity or reliability issues in the surrounding area 
and capacity projections must take in to account the impacts of climate change which 
will influence future infrastructure demand. 
2. Where potential capacity problems are identified, and no improvements are 
programmed by the utility company, the City Corporation will require developers to 
facilitate appropriate improvements which may require the provision of space within 
new developments for on -site infrastructure or off -site infrastructure upgrades. 
3. Developers are required to demonstrate, through effective engagement with 
providers, that adequat e utility infrastructure will be provided, both on and off the site, 
to serve the development during construction and operation. 
Reason for the policy 
5.4.13. Early engagement with infrastructure providers is essential to ensure that there 
is adequate capacity to serve the development during its construction and 
operational phases. 
How this policy works 
5.4.14. The Sustainability or Energy Statement submitted as part o f the planning 
application should set out the demand management measures incorporated into 
the scheme and should include evidence of engagement with providers. 
5.4.15. Infrastructure provision must be completed prior to the occupation of the 
development. The City Corporation will expect development to promote and 
contribute towards a low -carbon based economy, through smart buildings and 
incorporating alternative solution s into the design. It will be necessary for 
developers to establish if the proposal would lead t o overloading of the existing 
infrastructure , which may involve studies being undertaken by utility providers. 
Adequate time should be allowed to consider the supply options and to enable 
utility providers to collate an informed response. 
100  
 
   
    
  
 
      
 
   
   
  
 
 
   
  
     
   
  
  
   
  
 
  
     
     
    
  
  
   
  
    
   
    
     
  
  
    5.4.16. Projections of infrastructure demand should be realistic. Over specification 
should be avoided as it could result in under -utilisation of infrastructure. The 
cumulative impacts should be considered through discussion with providers and 
pre-application meet ings with the City Corporation. The co -ordination of 
infrastructure works is essential to minimise disruption and the impact on existing 
services. 
5.4.17. Developers will be required to submit written evidence from utility providers that 
effective engagement has been carried out. This could include a joint statement of 
intent endorsed by the relevant providers. S106 agreements may be used to 
ensure continuous engagement regarding route planning and confirmation of load 
demands. 
5.4.18. Redundant plant should be removed where possible to facilitate future 
infrastructure connections. Redundant infrastructure within the public realm, such 
as telephone boxes , should be removed unless it is of heritage interest. 
Policy IN3: Pipe Subways 
Developers and utility providers must provide entry and connection points within the 
development which relate to the City’s established utility infrastructure networks, 
utilising pipe subway routes where these are available. Sharing of routes with other 
nearby developments and the provision of new pipe subway facilities adjacent to 
buildings will be encouraged . 
Reason for the policy 
5.4.19. Expansion and integration of pipe subway and decentralised energy networks is 
a long -term aspiration of the City Corpo ration . The provision of additional pipe 
subways would provide greater capacity for pipes and cables , reducing the need 
for street works which often cause disruption. Pipe subways accommodate gas and 
water mains and electricity more effectively with easier access for maintenance, 
rather than burying pipes which are then not easily accessible. 
How the policy works 
5.4.20. The City Corporation will seek the expansion and integration of development 
into the pipe subway network where there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that 
services to development would be better integrated within an established pipe 
subway. Given the cost of installing new pipe subways, it is especially import ant to 
make efficient use of the existing network. Developments which are located 
adjacent to existing pipe subways will normally be expected to install connections.

Shape Outstanding Environments 
6.1. Design 
Context 
6.1.1. The built environment of the City of Londo n has a unique and distinctive 
character. Arranged on a predominantly medieval and Roman street pattern, high 
quality historic and modern buildings and urban green spaces create a rich visual 
landscape of building types, materials and architectural design. The City of London 
has a nationally and internationally renowned townscape. The City has been a 
centre for international trade for centuries and this long history of commercial 
activity and its modern role as a world -leading financial and professional ser vices 
centre is reflected in the design of the buildings and their activities. 
6.1.2. The demand for additional office floorspace and high land values within the 
Square Mile have resulted in a high -density and rapidly changing townscape which 
presents challenges and opportunities to ensure that new development delivers 
good growth. Innovative and creative solutions are required to optimise the use of 
land as a scarce resource, while creating architecture of a world class standard 
which enhances the City ’s rich character. 
6.1.3. To realise the City Corporation’s vision for the Square Mile, the design of the built 
environment should contribute towards the delivery of a competitive and creative 
City with exemplars of sustainable building design. Development shoul d contribute 
towards the aim of achieving a zero emission and climate resilient City by 20 40 in 
accordance with the City Corporation’s Climate Action Strategy . 
Strategic Policy S8: Design 
The City Corporation will promote innovative , sustainable and inclus ive high-quality 
buildings, streets and spaces . Design solutions should make effective use of limited 
land and contribute towards well-being and a greener, zero emission City , through 
development which : 
Form and Layout 
1. Optimises pedestrian movement by maximising permeability, providing external and 
internal pedestrian routes which are inclusive, welcoming, convenient, comfortable 
and attractive, enhancing the City’s characteristic network of accessible buildings, 
streets, courts and alleys; 
2. Is pedestria n-focused, reducing conflict between pedestrian and vehicular traffic, 
creating a safe and attractive public realm, prioritising pedestrians and cyclists, whilst 
mitigating the impact of building servicing; 
3. Delivers public ly accessible space within the development by maximising the amount 
of accessible , inclusive and free to enter roof terraces and spaces, including in tall 
buildings and along the river and around City landmarks; and 
102  
 
  
   
 
 
  
       
  
    
  
 
   
   
   
   
   
 
   
   
    
  
  
 
    
     
  
    
 
  
    
  
  
  
 
 
 
  4. Delivers world class sustainable buildings which are mixed -use, adapta ble, adopt 
circular economy principles and contribute towards a zero emission, zero carbon and 
climate resilient City . 
Experience 
5. Optimises micro -climatic conditions, addressing solar glare, daylight and sunlight , 
wind conditions and thermal comfort and delivers improvements in air quality, open 
space and views; 
6. Delivers street level building frontages which are active, public -facing, usable, 
permeable, interesting, well -detailed and appropriately lit, delivering suitable levels of 
passive surveillance; 
7. Optimises the amount of green infrastructure and amenity space integral to the 
architecture, enhancing public access to nature and biodiversity through maximising 
the provision of green roofs, walls and trees; and 
8. Delivers inclusive buildings, streets and spaces that meet the access needs of all the 
City’s communities irrespective of background or circumstance . 
Quality and character 
9. Delivers high quality sustainable architecture of a height, bulk, massing, scale, urban 
grain, material, quality and depth of modelling and detail which conserves and 
enhances the local and wider character and appearance of the City and is 
appropriate to its neighbours ; 
10. Incorporates sustainability measures and other plant and building services into a 
coherent architectural design; 
11. Considers lighting as an integral part of the design process, addressing issues of 
light spill/trespass to the public realm and the character of the area; 
12. Incorporates signage of an appropriate siting, size, form, appearance and 
illumination within the architecture of the building; 
13. Incorporates necessary security and safety measures as an integral part of the 
design; and 
14. Ensures that the building design concept is maintained from permission through to 
completion of a project. 
Reason for the policy 
6.1.4. As a world leading financial and professional services centre, the City requires 
world leading design in all aspects of the built environment, including the 
sustainability of new and refurbished buildings. 
103  
 
   
   
 
 
     
  
  
 
 
  
   
 
    
     
    
  
    
   
    
 
  
     
     
   
 
 
 
 
 
      
 
    
 
   
 
 
  
 
   
       
  
     
  
    
  How the policy works 
6.1.5. To create a zero -emission, sustainable City, development must be designed to 
minimise environmental impacts and be resilient to climate change throughout its 
lifecycle. 
6.1.6. The City of London will continue to be at the forefront of delivering the highest 
and most sustainable design standards . All development should demonstrate how 
it delivers the highest standard of design while also respecting its surroundings and 
the unique character and history of the City. Good design can have a positive 
impact for the wider community, within the City and beyond, improving access to 
buildings and th e inclusivity of the City to those who may not live or work here. The 
diversity of the townscape means that different design considerations apply to each 
site and these need to be carefully assessed to take account of each building’s 
context. This should not constrain design approaches, and a range of solutions 
may be appropriate. Liaison with the City Corporation , the City of London Police 
and the London Fire Brigade is essential at an early stage of design to ensure that 
buildings and spaces are safe and secure and reduce the potential for anti -social 
behaviour. 
6.1.7. The City Corporation will use a variety of modelling techniques to assist in the 
determination of planning applications. Developers will be required to use 
modelling techniques to demonstrate compliance with the City Corporation’s 
microclimate and thermal comfort planning advice notes. The City Corporation will 
use 3D digital modelling technology to assist in considering the visual impact of 
development, enabling an assessment to be made of the impact of development on 
townscape and skyscape. Developers will be required to provide digital 3D 
visualisations of their developments in a n open source or other format compatible 
with the City Corporation’s 3D digital modelling technology. 
6.1.8. The City has a large workforce whose numbers are expected to grow 
substantially , albeit that increased remote working means that actual footfall may 
not rise in proportion to total employment . Most journeys within the Square Mile are 
on foot and pedestrian movement is particularly high during morning and evening 
peak times. The City has retained much of its historic street pattern, which provides 
convenient walking routes and allows for a high degree of pedestrian permeability. 
The City Corporation uses pedestrian modelling to better understand pedestrian 
flows and to manage the impact of proposed new development. The Transport 
Strategy sets standards and targets for pedestrian accessibility w hich will be 
implemented, in part, through this Plan. 
6.1.9. The City has numerous small open spaces, which provide valuable amenities, 
many of which are of historic importance. The design of these small spaces 
requires innovative and sensitive design solutions w hich respect their character 
and setting and create high quality, accessible areas for all the City’s communities. 
The City’s streets provide space for public enjoyment, and the City Corporation has 
a programme of public realm enhancement projects to impr ove the quality, 
sustainability, inclusivity and amenity of the public realm.

  6.1.10. The City provides significant employment , residential and leisure opportunities 
that should be accessible to all. Accessibility to new and existing buildings and 
spaces must cr eate an inclusive environment. Adaptation of historic buildings 
requires careful design solutions. The City Corporation has an active programme of 
implementing access adaptations and will prepare further guidance for developers. 
Policy DE1: Sustainability Standards 
1. All development must demonstrate the highest feasible and viable sustainability 
standards in the design, construction, operation and “end of life” phases of 
development. 
2. Proposals for major development will be required to : 
• achie ve a minimum BREEAM rating of “excellent” and aim for “outstanding” 
against the current , relevant BREEAM criteria at the time of application , 
obtaining maximum credits for the City’s priorities (energy, water , pollution and 
materials ); 
• demonstrate that London Plan carbon emission and air quality requirements 
have been met on site , retaining embodied carbon within building structures 
where feasible . In exceptional circumstances where standards cannot be met 
on site offsetting will be required to account for the shortfall ; 
• demonstrate climate resilience in building and landscape design ; and 
• incorporate collective infrastructure such as heating and cooling networks, 
smart grids and collective battery storage where ver possible, to contribute to a 
zero-emissions, zero -waste, climate resilient City. 
Reason for the policy 
6.1.11. The drivers for sustainable development are increasing, affecting global and 
local businesses, workers, residents and visitors. The businesses that s urvive will 
be those that embrace sustainability and responsible consumption. The pace and 
prestigious nature of development in the City presents opportunities to incorporate 
innovative design in both new and existing buildings to provide positive 
environm ental outcomes for the City’s priorities: 
• Energy, carbon emissions and air pollutants – reducing emissions and moving 
to a zero emissions and zero carbon city by 20 40, in line with the requirements 
of the City Corporation’s Climate Action Strategy ; 
• Water – reducing water use in an area of serious water stress ; 
• Pollution – reducing exposure to poor air quality ; 
• Materials – retaining embodied carbon in existing buildings and materials , and 
improving resource efficiency . 
6.1.12. Social and environmental respons ibility is high on the agenda for many City 
businesses and their workforce and a working environment that supports these 
105  
 
      
  
 
    
 
 
  
  
    
   
 
         
  
   
  
 
    
 
  
    
  
   
  
    
    
     
    
 
  
    
   
    
  
  
   
  
  
   
  
 
  
  goals is essential for the City’s future . The London Plan provides a framework for 
driving forward this agenda , but it needs to be impl emented at a local level. 
6.1.13. The City of London Zero Emissions Study 2018 provides evidence for the 
trajectory to a zero emissions City. The role of collective infrastructures such as 
smart grids, battery storage , heating and cooling networks and hydrogen 
infrastructure are highlighted as essential elements of a future zero emissions City, 
where decarbonised electricity that does not contribute to future local levels of 
pollution, is the main energy source. Heating and cooling networks will increasingly 
exploit low carbon energy from waste heat and heat pump technologies rather than 
fossil fuels and contribute to reductions in primary energy demand, carbon 
emissions and nitrous oxides . Therefore , connection to these networks is expected 
wherever feasible , subject to appropriate decarbonisation plans . 
6.1.14. The City Corporation has adopted a Climate Action Strategy which sets out a 
trajectory towards zero carbon in the City of London by 2040 , and actions required 
to ensure that the City is resilient to the impacts of climate change . The application 
of sustainability standards through this Plan will contribute to the achievement of 
these objectives. Guidance in the area of sustainable developm ent is rapidly 
evolving. Applicants should use the most up to date guidance to inform their 
planning proposals. 
How the policy works 
6.1.15. The requirement for the highest feasible and viable sustainability standards 
applies to all development in the City, including major new development, 
extensions to existing buildings , major refurbishments and minor development. 
Refurbishments of existing buildings are subject to this policy where proposed 
works constitute developm ent. Refurbishments bring the benefit of re-using some 
of the existing building’s emb odied carbon. Standards required are those that are in 
place at the time of submission of a planning application. 
6.1.16. Sustainability Statements should be used to provide comp rehensive evidence of 
the sustainability of each development . 
6.1.17. For major development the Sustainability Statement should include: 
• a BREEAM pre -assessment or design stage assessment including a summary 
of the credits to be targeted in each category. Plannin g conditions will be used 
to require submission of a post construction BREEAM certificate to 
demonstrate implementation of the approved designs, achievement of the 
City’s priority credits and identify any performance gaps between design and 
completed devel opment. 
• an energy assessment in line with the Mayor’s Energy Planning Guidance. 
Where carbon offsetting is required , this will be secured through a S106 
agreement with offsetting contributions ring fenced for carbon reduction 
projects in the City or else where. 
106  
 
     
    
  
      
   
 
  
 
 
   
   
    
  
   
  
   
   
    
  
 
  
      
    
  
  
   
    
    
   
    
 
   
 
   
  
  
  
     
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 • an air quality assessment to meet the requirements of the London Plan 
demonstrating that the development will not result in deterioration in air quality, 
in line with the City of London Air Quality SPD. 
• details of the proposed adaptation and resil ience measures to make the 
building resilient to the climate and weather patterns it will encounter during its 
lifespan. 
• Details of collective infrastructure which has been incorporated to address 
environmental challenges . 
Extensions: 
• If a development proposal includes an extension greater than 25% of the 
existing floorspace or consists of a distinct structure greater than 1,000sq.m, 
the extension on its own should be treated as a major development and 
assessed accordingly , including co nsideration of London Plan carbon 
emission targets and BREEAM requirements. 
For minor development 
• Although minor development may provide more limited opportunities for the 
incorporation of sustainability features it is important that sustainability is 
considered at the design stage for all projects. For most minor development 
inclusion of sustainability information in the Design and Access Statement will 
suffice. 
Policy DE2: New Development 
1. Development should be of a world -class standard of design and architectural detail 
and should enhance the townscape and public realm. Development that would 
adversely affect the character , appearance or amenities of the buildings or area will 
be resisted. 
2. The design of all new development mus t ensure that: 
• The bulk and massing of schemes are appropriate in relation to their 
surroundings and have due regard to the general scale, height, building lines, 
character, historic interest and significance, urban grain and materials of the 
locality and relate well to the character of the area , enhancing pedestrian 
permeability ; 
• Appropriate, high quality , low carbon, sustainable and durable materials are 
used ; 
• The design and materials avoid unacceptable wind , loss of sunlight and 
thermal comfort impacts at street level or intrusive solar glare impacts on the 
surrounding townscape and public realm ; 
• Development has attractive and visually interesting street level elevations, 
providing active frontages wherever possible to maintain or enhance the 
vitality o f the City’s streets ; 
107  
 
     
     
  
  
   
  
 
  
   
     
       
   
  
    
 
  
   
   
   
  
 
 
  
 
  
   
   
   
 
     
   
   
     
   
 
 
   
   • Proposed uses can be accommodated within the curtilage of the development 
and do not rely on use of the public realm ; 
• Plant and building services equipment are fully screened from view and 
integrated into the design of the building ; 
• Servicing entrances are designed to minimise their effects on the appearance 
of the building and street scene and are fully integrated into the building’s 
design ; 
• There is provision of appropriate hard and soft landscaping, including 
appropriate boundary t reatments and urban greening ; 
• Buildings are inclusive and accessible to all ; 
• Security and safety measures are incorporated into the design at an early 
stage to avoid the need to retro -fit measures that adversely impact on the 
public realm or the quality of design; and 
• Opportunities are taken to enhance the appearance of the roofscape . 
Reason for the policy 
6.1.18. The network of routes and spaces, the scale, form, architectural expression and 
detailed design of buildings, together with the use of particular building materials, 
and the contribution of these elements to the composition of street blocks are 
characteris tic of, and combine to produce, the close -knit and intricate townscape of 
the City. It is important that new buildings and alterations respect and reinforce this 
general character. The City has dynamic, striking and internationally acclaimed 
architecture a s well as more contextual buildings appropriate to their townscape 
setting. 
How the policy works 
6.1.19. In assessing development schemes detailed consideration will be given to the 
bulk and massing and special characteristics of their locality. All development 
proposals are expected to have a high standard of design and architectural 
detailing. 
6.1.20. Wind conditions and solar glare may have an adverse effect on the surrounding 
townscape and the quality and use of the public realm. Assessments will need to 
be carried ou t on the impact of proposed development on wind conditions , thermal 
comfort and solar glare. Any adverse impacts will need to be mitigated and 
appropriate measures to achieve this should be integrated into the design of the 
development. The City Corporatio n has published guidelines for developers on 
wind microclimate studies required to support planning applications. Further 
guidance is available on solar glare, solar convergence and sunlight impacts of 
development . The City Corporation will publish a further Planning Advice Note for 
developers on addressing thermal comfort in the public realm . 
108  
 
     
    
   
  
     
     
 
 
      
  
  
 
 
  
   
     
     
    
   
 
   
    
   
  
    
     
  
      
   
   
 
   
    
 
 
  
   
 
    
    
   
   
 6.1.21. The design and execution of extensions and alterations to buildings, such as 
entrances and windows, are of considerable importance since they have a 
cumulative effect on the overall character and appearance of the City. Extensions 
or alterations should be considered in relation to the architectural character of the 
building, designed to minimise their impact and integrated into the design of the 
building. Alterations and extensions should achieve a successful design 
relationship with their surroundings, taking full account of the local context and the 
setting of the building. 
6.1.22. In most buildings, the ground floor elevation has the most effect on public 
amenity, so its de sign should be given particular attention to ensure that it is 
legible, visually attractive and provides active frontages. Blank frontages and 
ventilation louvres should be avoided. Ventilation louvres, where necessary , should 
be located away from busy streets . Servicing entrances should be carefully 
designed to minimise adverse effects on the townscape. 
6.1.23. Buildings must be able to accommodate proposed uses within the curtilage of 
the development, including provision of t ables and chairs. Proposed uses must not 
rely on the use of space in the public realm, including the use of public highway. 
6.1.24. The City of London has many public and private viewing galleries, terraces and 
tall buildings, meaning that many workers, residents and visitors see the 
townscape from above.  Attention should be given to the form, profile and general 
appearance of the roofscape to ensure that it complements the building as viewed 
from surrounding buildings as well as from the ground. The potential to add visual 
interest to a roofscape, including greening, should be designed in from the outset . 
6.1.25. Plant should be located below ground. Where this is not feasible, it should be 
satisfactorily integrated into the form and design of the roof. It should be enclo sed 
and covered where it would otherwise harm the appearance of the building, the 
general scene, or views from other buildings. Intake points should be located away 
from existing and potential pollution sources (e.g. busy roads and combustion 
flues) . All combustion flues should t erminate above the roof height of the t allest 
building in the development to ensure maximum dis persion of pollutants. 
Consideration should be given to the use of external heating and cooling supplies 
from district heating and cooling networks, such as the Citigen network, where 
available, as these may avoid or reduce the need for roof top installations such as 
boiler flues, cooling towers and plant rooms, as well as providing wider 
environmental benefits. 
6.1.26. Servicing entrances c an have a detrimental impact on the appearance of the 
building and its immediate setting and can harm otherwise attractive pedestrian 
routes. The City Corporation expects innovative design solutions for servicing 
entrances and adjacent areas to minimise th eir visual impact and to enable them to 
be integrated into the design of the building. Design solutions must respect the 
sensitive nature of listed buildings and conservation areas. Gates and doors 
should be well designed and should be kept closed when th e entrance to the 
service bay is not in use. 
109  
 
    
     
   
     
    
    
   
  
       
  
  
   
    
   
    
  
  
 
    
    
  
 
 
   
    
   
 
       
   
  
   
     
  
  
    
    
     
     
     
  
    
      
   6.1.27. Ventilation or extraction systems should be routed internally and extensive or 
unsightly external ducting will not normally be permitted . Provision must be made 
within the building for services and ducting to an d from all uses. Ventilation 
systems in new build p remises for extracting and dispersing any emissions and 
cooking smells must be discharged at roof level and designed, installed, operated 
and maintained in accordance with manufacturer ’s specification in order to prevent 
smells and emissions adversely affecting neighbours . For changes of use, 
developers and/or occupiers should investigate the potential to vent emissions to 
the roo f. Where it can be demonstrated that venting of such emissions to the roof is 
not practical , venting to an adjacent footway will only be acceptable where the 
extraction system is of the highest specification for odour abatement and there is 
no adverse impact on neighbours by virtue of smells or other emissions . Other 
ventilation louvres should not be sited by adjoining footways. Developments should 
incorporate suitable off-street facilities for smokers wherever possible to avoid the 
need for smokers to congregate on the pavements. 
6.1.28. Developers should provide suitable rooftop ventilation for the City’s sewer 
network, where appropriate, and this should be integrated into the design of 
buildings. 
6.1.29. Strategic Polic y S2 (Safe and Secure City ) and Policy SA 3 (Designing in 
Security ) set out how appropriate security and safety provision must be 
incorporated into al l development. 
Policy D E3: Public Realm 
The City Corporation will work in partnership with developers, Transport for London and 
other organisations to design and implement schemes for the enhancement of the 
streets and spaces between buildings and the creation of new spaces . Public realm 
schemes must be of a high standard of design, sustainability, surface treatment and 
landscaping, having regard to: 
• The predominant use and function of the space and adjacent spaces ; 
• The use of sustainable natural materials, avoiding an excessive range and 
harmonising with the surroundings of the scheme and materials used 
throughout the City ; 
• The inclusion of trees and soft landscaping and the promotion of biodiversity, 
where feasible linking up existing green spaces and routes to provide green 
corridors ; 
• The City’s heritage, identifying and retaining features that contribute positively 
to the character , cultural experience and appearance of the City ; 
• The provision of sustainable drainage, where feasible, co -ordinating the design 
with adjacent buildings to facilitate the implementation of rainwater recycling ; 
• The need to provide accessible and inclusive design that meets the needs of 
different users , ensuring that streets and walkways remain uncluttered and 
enhance pedestrian permeability ; 
• The need to provide a h igh quality, safe and functional public realm ; 
110  
 
      
 
   
 
  
   
    
  
  
 
   
   
  
   
  
 
 
 
 
  
    
   
   
    
  
   
  
  
   
  
 
 
 
 
   
  
   
    
 • The sensitive co -ordination of lighting with the overall design of the scheme ; 
and 
• The wellbeing of users in relation to air pollution, noise, temperatures, shading 
and microclimate . 
Reason for the policy 
6.1.30. The City Corporation will actively promote schemes for the enhancement of the 
street scene and public realm. High quality natural mate rials are characteristic of 
the City of London and add greatly to the character and identity of streets, courts 
and spaces. Wherever possible, the City Corporation will retain these surface 
materials and will carry out repairs to match and extend their us e.  Elsewhere, the 
City Corporation will encourage a limited palette of materials, providing continuity in 
the streetscape, and ease of access through the City. 
How the policy works 
6.1.31. The City Corporation will undertake public realm enhancement works throu gh 
specifically targeted projects or in association with general street maintenance and 
vehicle, cycle and pedestrian traffic management schemes.  The City Corporation 
will use s106 planning obligations, s278 highways contributions, the Community 
Infrastru cture Levy and funding from external sources to deliver enhancement 
works. 
6.1.32. All projects in the public realm should be inclusive in design so that they provide 
equal access for all people in the City. Consideration should be given to design 
features which prevent damage from the activities of skaters , such as metal studs 
incorporated into street furniture and hard surfaces. Designs should be robust and 
durable and use sustainable and low carbon materials . 
6.1.33. The incorporation of artworks or integral decorative features, such as sculptures, 
fountains and schemes included in the City Arts Initiative , to create animated 
spaces, will be encouraged . Early consideration of their design, management and 
maintenance regime . Detailed guidance is provided in Policy CV5. 
6.1.34. Further information on design requirements for the public realm is available in 
the City Public Realm SPD, the City Public Realm Technical Manual , Conservation 
Area Character Summaries and Management Strategies , where appropriate, and 
the Mayor of London’s Streetscape Guidance . 
Policy DE4: Pedestrian permeability 
1.Improved wayfinding will be sought through public realm improvements. 
Development will be required to contribute towards the improvement of pedestrian 
permeability in the City by: 
• Providing legible, good quality, safe and low pollution pedestrian connections 
between spaces; 
111  
 
     
 
     
     
 
   
   
   
  
  
    
  
   
 
 
     
   
   
  
 
  
  
   
      
    
  
  
 
  
    
    
     
          
   
     
  
     
 • Providing new pedestrian routes through buildings and development sites , 
where feasible , and r especting, maintaining and restoring, the City’s 
characteristic network of accessible buildings, streets , courts and alleyways ; 
• Providing publicly accessible ground floors for improved pedestrian movement, 
where feasible ; 
• Providing pedestrian routes that are of adequate width, step -free and follow 
best practice in street design to encourage ease of movement . 
2. Developments should enhance pedestrian permeability and not lead to the loss of 
routes and spaces that enhance the City’s function, character and historic interest. 
Reason for the policy 
6.1.35. The intensification of the use of buildings and the increase in the City’s working 
population are putting added pressure on the capacity, convenience, comfort and 
safety of the spaces, streets, lanes and alleys at the heart of the City. Peak times 
are par ticularly busy for all forms of transport, and the potential for conflict between 
modes of travel is increased. 
6.1.36. Most travel in and through the City is on foot . The City Corporation has adopted 
Transport for London’s Legible London as a means of improving wayfinding within 
and through the City of London. 
How the policy works 
6.1.37. In order to reduce pedestrian congestion and improve pedestrian access 
through the public realm, new pathways for moving through the City will need to be 
created or re -establi shed. Spreading the footfall across a wider area will help to 
create a more vibrant and comfortable street network. 
6.1.38. Development will be expected to deliver net gains in the public realm, through 
the establishment of new pedestrian routes around and through buildings , having 
regard to the cumulative impact of their development alongside existing and 
permitted development on the capacity of pedestrian routes . Publicly accessible 
ground floors will be encouraged where pedestrian desire lines would otherwise be 
affected and permeability of the City compromised. The City Corporation has 
developed a block size analysis which identifies large impermeable street blocks 
across the City in order to prioritise the identification of new pedestrian routes 
through development proposals. Over the Plan period the aim is to reduce the 
proportion of larger street block s (shown in blue on Figure 11) and to in crease the 
proportion of smaller block s. 
6.1.39. Developers will be required to meet the cost of updates to the Legible London 
map database which are required as a result of development , and to fund the 
provision of new Legible London tot ems, where necessary.

Figure 11: Block Size Analysis 
Policy D E5: Terraces and Viewing Galleries 
1. Roof terraces will be encouraged where : 
• The roof terrace is visually integrated into the overall design of the building 
when seen from both street level and higher -level viewpoints; 
• There would be no immediate o verlooking of residential premises , 
unacceptable disturbance from noise or other significantly adverse impacts on 
residential amenity . Where there is a potential for a significantly adverse 
impact , the use of an extensive green roof and a restriction on access should 
be considered as an alternative ; 
• Historic or locally distinctive roof forms, features or structures can be retained 
and enhanced; 
• There would be no adverse impact on protected views; 
• The design and layout of the terrac e optimises the potential for urban 
greening ; 
• Emissions from combustion plant will not affect users of the terrace .

   2. Where roof terraces and viewing galleries are proposed, security risks must be 
addressed at the design stage and space for security checks incorporated into the 
development, where required . 
3. The provision of free to enter, publicly accessible areas will be required as part of all 
tall building or major developments, which may include roof gardens and terraces or 
public viewing galleries at upper levels, where appropriate. 
Reason for the policy 
6.1.40. Roof gardens and terraces are becoming increasingly common in the City , in 
response to demand from developers and occupier s. Public and private roof 
gardens and terraces present an opportunity for additional amenity space, urban 
greenery and the creation of new viewpoints of the City and the surrounding areas, 
thereby reinforcing London’s cultural and historic attractions. 
How the policy works 
6.1.41. The City Corporation encourages proposals for roof gardens and terraces where 
they are sympathetic to existing roof forms and features, particularly those of 
historic interest or which are otherwise locally distinctive and where they do not 
impact adversely on residential amenity . There should be no impact on strategic or 
locally protected views. 
6.1.42. Where r oof terraces and gardens are publicly accessible entrances should not 
result in safety or security concerns , create congestion or adversely impact on the 
environmental quality at street level. Security implications should be considered at 
the design stage o f the development, including making provision for security 
checks within the development , where required. Opening hours may be managed 
by condition or agreement, particularly where there are residential premises 
nearby. Roof terraces should not significant ly increase noise levels , or result in 
unacc eptable light spillage in areas with residents or other sensitive uses . 
Appropriate safety features should be included to prevent people from jumping or 
falling . The City Corporation is producing guidelines to advise developers on best 
practi ce to reduce the potential for suicides from tall buildings . The positioning of 
combustion flues should be carefully considered so as to not expose users of the 
roof terrace to pollution emissions from combustion plant. 
6.1.43. Public access to tall buildings within the City is important in creating an inclusive 
city. Tall buildings should provide publicly accessible areas which are free to enter. 
These may include public viewing galleries at upper levels or other forms of open 
space provision and may provide retail, leisure or educational facilities to enhance 
their attraction .

 Policy D E6: Shopfronts  
Shopfronts should be of a high standard of design and appearance; inappropriate 
designs and alterations will be resisted. Shopfront proposals should: 
• Respect the quality and architectural contribution of any existing shopfront ; 
• Maintain the relationship between the shopfront, any fa scia, the building and 
its context ; 
• Use materials which are sympathetic to the wider context and are of high 
quality ; 
• Ensure that signage is in appropriate locations and in proportion to the 
shopfront ; 
• Take into account the impact of louvres, plant and access to refuse storage ; 
• Ensure that awnings and canopies are positioned only in locations where they 
would not harm the appearance of the shopfront , obstruct architectural 
features or views and are in compliance with highway requirements ; 
• Avoid openable shopfronts or large serving openings where they would have a 
harmful impact on the appearance of the building and/or amenity of the area ; 
• Avoid external shutters and contain alternative se curity measures , where 
required ; 
• Avoid opaque windows and provide retail displays which encourage browsing 
and passive surveillance ; 
• Ensure that the design is inclusive incorporating level entrances and adequate 
door widths ; and 
• Ensure that internal sh op lighting does not create inappropriate light spillage 
into the public realm . 
Reason for the policy 
6.1.44. Shopfronts are important elements in the townscape and can contribute 
significantly to the street scene. The design of a shopfront should recognise this 
and be appropriate to, or enhance, the building and its location. It should respect 
the design of the building and not obscure, or result in damage to, existing 
architectural features. 
6.1.45. Existing shopfronts should be retained where they contri bute to the appearance 
or special interest of a building or the street scene, particularly in listed buildings or 
conservation areas, or those that are of design or historic significance in their own 
right or as part of a group. Any modifications necessary should be sympathetic to 
the original design. 
115  
 
   
     
   
    
  
   
    
   
    
 
  
    
   
  
  
   
  
   
    
   
      
  
    
  
   
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
  
    
  
    
 
    How the policy works 
6.1.46. New shopfront proposals should relate to the upper floors of the building and 
surrounding buildings , providing consistency with neighbouring premises, where 
appropriate. New shopfronts s hould utilise high quality materials and finishes. The 
City Corporation will seek a reduction in fascias of excessive dimensions (height, 
width and depth), which are out of proportion or scale with the shopfront or have a 
detrimental visual effect on the b uilding or the street scene. 
6.1.47. Modification to shopfronts and shopfront designs to incorporat e louvres, plant or 
refuse accommodation should be undertaken in a manner sympathetic to the 
design and character of the building where they cannot be accommodated in less 
sensitive elevations. Awnings and canopies , where appropriate, should be 
integrated in to the shopfront design in relation to size, location and materials. 
6.1.48. Fully o penable shopfronts and large serving openings may be refused where 
they create a void at ground floor level that could harm the appearance of buildings 
and create potential amenity issues. 
6.1.49. Required security measures should be internal to limit their visual impact on 
shopfronts. External security shutters are not normally acceptable , except where 
they are a characteristic of historic shopfront s. Internal shutters should be 
perforated to enable visibility into the shop and passive surveillance. To enliven 
frontages and enable passive surveillance, all retail frontages should provide good 
visibility and glazing should not be blanked out. The installation of security glass 
and steel reinforced frontages will be considered in the context of the impact on the 
appearance and historic significance of the shopfront. 
6.1.50. Retail entrances should be designed with level entrances to enable inclusive 
access by all. Other measures and movable ramps should be used exceptionally 
where level entrance is not feasible. 
Policy D E7: Advertisements 
1. Advertising must be of a high standard of design, restrained in amount and in 
keeping with the character of the City. 
2. Excessive or obtrusive advertising, inappropriate illuminated signs and the display of 
advertisements above ground floor level will be re sisted. 
Reason for the policy 
6.1.51. To protect and enhance the character of the City’s streets, the City Corporation 
considers that advertising material should be restrained in quantity and form.  Poor 
quality advertisements harm the street scene and the unique character of the City 
of London. The City Corporation will exercise advertisement control having regard 
to visual amenity and public safety and will seek improvements to the design of 
advertisements, where necessary. 
116  
 
   
    
   
    
   
  
 
     
  
   
    
  
    
  
 
  
   
 
  
    
 
    
     
     
  
    
    
  
 
  
   
   
  
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 How the policy works 
6.1.52. Advertising hoardings and advertisements on street furniture will not normally be 
permitted as these detract from the character of the City. The display of 
advertisements on construction site hoardings will be resisted unless directly 
related to the development site. Construction hoardings may, however, provide an 
opportunity to add interest to the street scene by including images and information 
about the development under construction. Further guidance is contained in the 
City Corporation’s Hoardings Advice Note. 
6.1.53. The design of advertising material should respect its locality and use appropriate 
materials of high quality. Advertisements should be appropriate to the frontage 
served and should not include static or moving projection of images beyond the 
frontage, such a s laser projections and projections on building façades, to protect 
visual amenity and public safety. Illumination of advertisements should be discreet 
and incorporate LEDs to reduce the overall bulk and energy use of signage. 
Advertising flags and banner s will not normally be permitted except where 
appropriate for cultural institutions. Rotating advertisements will be resisted as 
these detract from the City’s character. 
6.1.54. Particular care will be necessary with advertisements on or in the setting of 
listed buildings and within conservation areas. Internal illumination of 
advertisements in such areas will not normally be permitted. 
6.1.55. Advertisements above ground level are detrimental to the appearance and 
visual amenity of the street scene and can detract from the character and qualities 
of individual buildings by obscuring architectural features and the City’s streetscape 
and skyline . While there are exceptions, such as traditional or historic signs, signs 
in an elevated position will not usually be permitted. 
6.1.56. Appropriate action will be taken to have unauthorised advertisements removed. 
The City Corporation’s Transport Strategy requires that pavements are kept clear 
of obstructions through a range of actions, which include not permitting A-boards 
on the pavement and encouraging owners and occupiers not to place A -boards on 
private land adjacent to the pavement. 
Policy D E8: Daylight and sunlight 
1. Development proposals will be requir ed to demonstrate that the daylight and sunlight 
available to nearby dwellings and open spaces is appropriate for its context and 
provides acceptable living standards , taking account of the Building Research 
Establishment’s guidelines. 
2. The design of new developments should allow for the lighting needs of intended 
occupiers and provide acceptable levels of daylight and sunlight consistent with a city 
centre context , minimising the need for artificial lighting . 
117  
 
     
  
 
  
   
  
  
   
   
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
 
 
   
  
  
  
   
 
   
  
 
  
  
    
    
 
  
 
 
  
 
  3. Development should incorporate design measure s to mitigate adverse solar glare 
effects on surrounding buildings and public realm. 
Reason for the policy 
6.1.57. The City is an urban centre with a very high density of buildings , resulting in 
lower average levels of daylight and sunlight to buildings and spaces in comparison 
to sub urban or rural areas . The amount of daylight and sunlight received has an 
important effect on the amenity of dwellings, the appearance and enjoyment of the 
open spaces and streets of the City, and the energy efficiency of all buildings. 
Access to appropriate levels of daylight and sunlight is important for the mental 
health of workers and residents. 
How the policy works 
6.1.58. The Building Research Establishment (BRE) has issued guidelines in ‘Site 
Layout Planning fo r Daylight and Sunlight’ that set out a methodology for assessing 
changes in daylight and sunlight arising from new development. The City 
Corporation will apply these methods, consistent with BRE and NPPF guidance 
that ideal daylight and sunlight condition s may not be practicable in densely 
developed city -centre locations. Given the importance of the City’s open spaces in 
a high -density urban environment, the impact of any changes to sunlight on the 
public realm will need to be carefully evaluated even if p roposals comply with BRE 
guidelines. Developers will be required to submit daylight and sunlight 
assessments in support of their proposals. The City Corporation may require 
independent verification of these assessments at the developer’s expense. 
6.1.59. When cons idering proposed changes to existing lighting levels, the City 
Corporation will take account of the cumulative effect of development proposals, 
and existing levels of light if they are low. The City Corporation will take into 
account unusual existing circumstances, such as development on an open or low -
rise site as well as the presence of balconies or other external features, which limit 
the daylight and sunlight that a building can receive. The Mayor of London has 
indicated that guidance on daylight and sunlight standards will be produced to 
support the London Plan. 
6.1.60. Planning considerations concerning daylight and sunlight operate independently 
of any common law rights and any light and air agr eements which may exist.  If a 
development is considered beneficial in the public interest and has planning 
permission, but it is not proceeding due to rights to light issues, the City 
Corporation may consider acquiring interests in land or appropriating l and for 
planning purposes to enable development to proceed.

    Policy D E9: Lighting 
1. Lighting should be sensitively co -ordinated with the overall design of any new 
development , having regard to siting, scale, type, intensity and colour temperature of 
light. Development proposals should consider the lighting strategy early in the design 
process. 
2. Development should incorporate measures to reduce light spillage from external and 
internal lighting, particularly where it would impact adversely on neighbouring 
occupiers, the wider public realm and biodiversity. 
3. The external lighting of buildings should contribute positively to the unique character 
and grandeur of the City townsca pe by night. 
4. External lighting of heritage assets within the City must be sympathetic to the building 
and the wider context in terms of tone and brightness. 
Reason for the policy 
6.1.61. The City Corporation ’s Lighting Strategy contribute s to the City ’s wider aims of 
improving the night -time offering and creating an after -dark street experience that 
befits a world class business and cultural centre. Well -designed light ing schemes 
on commercial properties within the City can help create an attractive night -time 
townscape and enhance the experience for visitors, whilst avoiding disturbance to 
residents. 
6.1.62. Development has the potential to positively or adversely affect the level of 
lighting in the surrounding area, so the lighting scheme should be incorporate d into 
the detailed design process at an early stage. Intensity, colour, scale and glare are 
all factors to be considered. Sensitively designed lighting schemes can improve 
accessibility for those with disabilities by reducing glare and excessive contrast. 
Lighting can support the prevention and dete ction of crime and anti -social 
behaviour and improve the perception of personal security . In the City, the 
predominance of glazed office buildings can lead to light spillage concerns for 
neighbouring residents w ith a potential impact on wellbeing. Avoidance of light 
spillage onto urban green spaces is crucial for biodiversity . 
How the policy works 
6.1.63. The highlighting of key buildings, bridges and other points of interest within the 
City at night time is appropriate where it enhances the overall experience of this 
unique area, and provid es orientation and wayfinding after dark. 
6.1.64. The Illuminated River ar t project, to be implemented fully by 2022, will enhance 
the visual impact at night time through lighting of all 5 bridges located in the City. 
This will be complemented by a reduction in street lighting on the bridges. 
6.1.65. The external illumination of buildi ngs, where appropriate, should be carefully 
designed to ensure visual sensitivity, minimal energy use and light pollution, and 
the discreet integration of light fittings into the building design. Lighting intensity, 
119  
 
    
  
   
   
   
    
   
    
 
   
    
   tone and colour need to respect the arch itectural form and detail of the building, be 
sensitive to the setting of historic buildings and limit adverse effects upon adjacent 
areas , uses and biodiversity . 
6.1.66. There is potential for badly designed lighting schemes to generate light pollution 
with adve rse impacts on neighbours and the natural environment, as well as 
incurring unnecessary costs for the occupier. The design of lighting schemes 
should be considered at an early stage in the development design process, having 
regard to the City of London Lighting Strategy . Developers should submit a Lighting 
Strategy with their planning application if a proposal includes the installation of 
external lighting or light spillage into the public realm . 
6.1.67. The City Corporation will prepare further planning guidance to assist developers 
in the design of appropriate lighting schemes. Detailed information on requirements 
for lighting can be found in the City of London Lighting Strategy.

 6.2. Vehicular Transport and Servicing 
Context 
6.2.1. The City is served by a n extensive public transport network with six mainline 
railway stations, 12 underground and DLR stations and an extensive network of 
bus routes. Transport for London identifies the whole of the City of London as 
having a Public transport Accessibility rating of above 6, the highest possible score. 
In addition, major rail termini near the City are used by large numbers of City 
commuters. Significant improvements are being made to public transport provision, 
particularly with the opening of the Elizabeth Line with two stations in the City at 
Farringdon and Liverpool Street/Moorgate. There are also river bus services which 
stop at Blackfriars Pier and at Tower Pier just outside the City. 
6.2.2. The City has access to a very wide regional labour pool with many of its 
businesses drawing their workforces from destinations across London and the 
wider South East. The provision of safe, convenient, sustainable and effective 
public transport services and facilities is critical to the City’s international 
competitiveness and its ability to continue to attract highly skilled workers. Given 
the unique nature of the City, with its comparatively low residential population and 
its dependence on inward commuting, the widely publicised ‘15 -minute cities’ 
concept is not directly r elevant to the City’s circumstances. For instance, some 
services for City residents are provided in adjoining boroughs through partnership 
working arrangements, since it may not be cost effective to deliver those services 
within the Square Mile. The polici es in this Plan seek to facilitate ease of access to 
jobs and services by walking and cycling for those who are able to do so, including 
ensuring good connections to neighbouring boroughs. 
6.2.3. Traffic in the City has changed significantly over the last two dec ades, both in 
terms of total volume and overall composition. Biennial traffic counts across the 
City show a 40% decrease in overall traffic volumes, with greater reductions for 
motor vehicles such as cars and light goods vehicles. The greatest observed 
reductions have coincided with key events such as the introduction of the 
Congestion Charge Zone, the global recession and the introduction of cycle 
superhighways. The street capacity unlocked by these reductions , alongside 
increases in cycling infrastructure provision , has facilitated an estimated tripling of 
cycling volumes across the City. 
6.2.4. Despite traffic reduction s, there are still significant challenges. Traffic counts in 
autumn 2017 found a slight increase in car volumes, probably caused by the 
increasin g volumes of private hire vehicles. Freight vehicle numbers , after dropping 
significantly between 1999 and 2004, have levelled off in recent years. The rapid 
increase in cycling volumes seen in the first decade of the 21st century has not 
been sustained, w ith volumes slightly decreasing in recent years.  
6.2.5. The demands on the City’s transport network are increasing due to significant 
growth, fast -moving technological development and changing travel habits. In light 
of these factors, the City Corporation publi shed a long -term Transport Strategy in 
2019 which set s the key priorities for the City’s streets and how the network is 
used. The Transp ort Strategy was developed in parallel with the drafting of the 
121  
 
       
   
 
  
 
 
  
  
    
  
   
  
  
  
  
    
     
   
   
 
     
  
    
  
   
 
  
     
  
 
   
    
   
    
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Local Plan and the policies set out in both are aligned. Measures to support the 
City’s Covid -19 recovery may provide an opportunity to accelerate delivery of some 
elements of the Transport Strategy. 
6.2.6. The Mayor’s Transport Strategy provides London -wide guidance, which is 
implemented through the City’s Local Implementation Plan. Transport providers 
serving the City publish plans and strategies that influence investment and 
management decisions affecting the City’s transport network. 
Strategic Policy S 9: Vehicular Transport and Servicing 
The City’s t ransp ort infrastructure will be maintained and improved by: 
1. Safeguarding land where necessary, as shown on the Policies Map, to enable the 
delivery of increased public transport capacity, including the Northern Line/Bank 
Station upgrade. Proposals which are con trary to the safeguarding of strategic 
infrastructure projects will be refused. 
2. Implementing improvements to street -level interchange between Fenchurch Street 
and Tower Hill/Tower Gateway stations and working with partners to explore the 
feasibility of a d irect interchange route in the longer -term. 
3. Promoting further improvements to public transport capacity and step -free access at 
existing mainline rail , London Underground stations and river piers . 
4. Minimising road danger and congestion , and reducing vehicle emissions by: 
• Designing and managing streets in accordance with the City of London street 
hierarchy; 
• Minimising the impact of freight and servicing trips through such measures as 
the provision of on -site servicing facilities, the timi ng of deliveries outside peak 
hours, the adoption of area -wide solutions , freight consolidation and promoting 
deliveries by foot or bicycle for shorter distances ; 
• Facilitating essential traffic, including emergency service vehicles, buses, 
freight and pri vate transport for people with particular access needs, w hilst 
minimising the environmental impact of these modes; 
• Encouraging the provision of infrastructure for alternative -fuel vehicles and 
zero emissions vehicles , such as off -street vehicle charging po ints; 
• Using traffic management measures and street works permits to improve 
journey time reliability on the City’s roads; and 
• Requiring developers to demonstrate, through Transport Assessments, 
Construction Logistics Plans, Travel Plans , Cycling Promotion Plans and 
Delivery and Servicing Plans, how the environmental impacts and road danger 
of travel and servicing will be minimised as a result of their development , 
including through the use of river transport.

  Reason for the policy 
6.2.7. The City’s strategic central London position and its comprehensive transport 
infrastructure enable the vast majority of workers, residents and visitors to use 
public transport to access the City from across London and the wider south east. 
93% of commuter travel to t he City is by public transport, walking or cycling. Less 
than 5% of City worker s drive to work. The City is already a highly sustainable 
location, and the opening of the Elizabeth Line will result in a wider catchment area 
within an hour’s journey time of the City. The City Corporation will use its planning 
powers , alongside its role as a transport authority, and in partnership with 
Transport for London to help secure improvements to public transport, for instance 
by safeguarding land from other forms of de velopment where necessary. 
Figure 12: Rail and underground network 
6.2.8. The City’s Transport Strategy indicates that the design and management of 
streets will reflect their position in the street hierarchy, as well as their function as 
places.

Table 3: City of London street hierarchy 
6.2.9. The TfL network (classed as London Access) is expected to accommodate the 
majority of through traffic, while roads which are managed by the City Corporation 
are classed as either City Access or Local Access. Propos ed changes to the 
highway network at Bank Junction, St Paul’s Gyratory and Beech Street are 
reflected in the street hierarchy .

 How the policy works 
6.2.10. The City’s Transport Strategy aims to support the continued reduction of motor 
vehicle traffic on the City’s streets, with targets proposed to reduce the number of 
motor vehicles in the City by at least 25% by 2030 and at least 50% by 204 4. The 
spare capacity unlocked by these reductions will allow for th e radical 
transformation of the City’s streets to deliver a healthier, safer and more attractive 
street environment. 
6.2.11. Achievement of the targets is dependent on measures introduced by the Mayor 
of London and TfL, such as the Central London Zero Emission Zone, although the 
City Corporation will explore specific measures within the City of London if strategic 
scale measures are not progressed. The City Corporation will also implement 
measures such as timed closures and additional traffic calming to facilitate the 
removal of non -essential vehicular traffic. 
6.2.12. The City Corporation will work with TfL to review bus routing and frequency 
through the City to ma intain or improve journey times and connectivity while 
enhancing the pedestrian environment. 
6.2.13. The City Corporation will work with TfL to prioritise investment in accessibility 
improvements to underground and DLR stations and will seek to identify 
opportuni ties to introduce step free access as part of new developments and major 
refurbishments. 
6.2.14. The City Corporation will require d evelopers and occupiers to minimise the 
impact of freight and servicing trips through measures such as the retiming of 
deliveries an d collections outside peak periods, along with consolidation onto fewer 
or different types of vehicles. 
6.2.15. Greater use of the River Thames will be encouraged for both passenger and 
freight transport purposes to alleviate the need for some motor vehicle trips on the 
City’s streets. 
Policy VT1: The impacts of development on transport 
1. Development proposals must have a positive impact on highway safety for all users 
and not have adverse effects on the City’s transport networks. Where development 
would result in a dverse impacts on the transport network, these must be mitigated 
though site/building design and management of operational activities. Appropriate 
measures will be sought via planning contributions or by legal agreement. 
2. The design and implementation of t raffic management and highway security 
measures must be agreed with the City Corporation and Transport for London, where 
appropriate , and may include restricting motor vehicle access and using traffic 
calming measures to limit the opportunity for hostile v ehicle approach. 
3. Transport Assessments and Travel Plans (incorporating Cycling Promotion Plans) 
are required for all developments that exceed the following thresholds: 
125  
 
   
  
  
  
  
  
   
   
  
 
 
  
    
   
    
   
   
   
  
    
  
   
   
  
  
  
 
   
    
 
 
  
     
    
 
        
       
    
 
 
 
 
   
 
   Land Use Thresholds 
Offices 1,000m2 
Residential 10 units 
Retail 1,000m2 
Hotel 10 bed spaces 
Health 1,000m2 
Transport Infrastructure >500 additional trips per peak hour 
Mixed Use 1,000m2 
4. A Construction Logistics Plans is required for all major developments or 
refurbishments and for any developments that would have a significant impact on the 
transport network during construction. 
Reason for the policy 
6.2.16. Development has the potential to create significant changes in transport patterns 
and demands that must be addressed at an early stage of the design process. Any 
adverse impacts that are identified must be minimised and mitigated through 
appropriate design and/or management measures. Transport Assessments are 
required to assess the potential impacts of development, while Travel Plans will be 
required to maximise the use of active transport modes and public transport. 
How the policy works 
6.2.17. An assessment of th e transport implications of development, during both 
construction and operation, should address the impacts on: 
• Road danger; 
• Pedestrian environment and movement; 
• Cycling infrastructure provision; 
• Public transport; and 
• The street network. 
6.2.18. Transport Assessm ents and Travel Plans (incorporating Cycling Promotion 
Plans) should be used to demonstrate adherence to the City Corporation’s 
Transport Standards. Applicants should discuss the scope of the transport 
documentation required early in the pre -application st age to ensure that it provides 
evidence tailored to the City’s specific circumstances. Account should be taken of 
the cumulative transport impact s of other nearby developments. TfL has prepared 
further guidance for developers on Transport Assessments which is available on 
the TfL website. 
6.2.19. A full Construction Logistics Plan (CLP) will be required by condition with outline 
details required at the application stage . A CLP should comply with the measures 
set out in the City Corporation’s Code of Practice for Deconstruction and 
126  
 
     
    
 
      
     
 
 
  
  
     
 
    
     
 
     
 
  
     
  
   
    
   
   
 
    
 
     
  
   
  
    
   
  
   
   
     
  
 
 Construction Sites and with TfL’s online guidance . The CLP should show examples 
of how vehicles will be managed in line with the need to Reduce, Re -time and Re -
mode (the three Rs ). 
6.2.20. Development will be subject to conditions, Section 106 and Section 278 
Agreements to ensure appropriate mitigat ion of any adverse transport impacts. 
Community Infrastructure Levy contributions will be used by the City Corpora tion to 
deliver wider improvements to the transport network, where appropriate. 
Policy VT2: Freight and Servicing 
1. Applicants should consult with the City Corporation on matters relating to servicing at 
an early design concept stage. Development should be designed to provide for on -
site servicing , wherever practicable . 
2. Developments must minimise the need for freight trips and seek to work together with 
adjoining owners and occupiers to manage freight and servicing on an area -wide 
basis. Major commercial de velopment must provide for freight consolidation. New 
technologies will be encouraged to enable efficient servicing and deliveries to sites. 
3. On site servicing areas must be provided to allow all goods and refuse collection 
vehicles likely to service the development at the same time to be conveniently loaded 
and unloaded. Servicing areas should provide sufficient space or facilities for all 
vehicles to enter and exit the s ite in a forward gear. Servicing areas must be 
equipped with electric vehicle fast charging points. 
4. Delivery to and servicing of development must take place outside peak hours (i.e. 
avoiding deliveries between 7am -10am, 12pm -2pm and 4pm -7pm on weekdays). 
Deliveries should be made in the late evening or at weekends outside of residential 
areas. Areas of high footfall may be subject to further restrictions. 
5. Developers should consider ways to reduce congestion caused by servicing and 
deliveries, such as implem enting last mile deliveries by foot, cycle or zero emission 
vehicle, and should justify where such measures are not possible. Developers will be 
encouraged to identify opportunities for last mile logistic hubs where appropriate. 
6. Provision should be made within buildings for shredding operations . 
Reason for the policy 
6.2.21. The low numbers of private motor vehicles in the City mean that delivery and 
service vehicles have a relatively greater impact on traffic congestion and air 
quality, especially in areas of high-density development and narrow streets. 
Efficient off -street servicing and delivery arrangements are vital to keep the City’s 
traffic moving and thereby avoid air pollution caused by stationary traffic. The 
Mayor’s Transport Strategy aims to reduce the n umber of lorries and vans entering 
central London in the morning peak by 10% by 2026. The City’s Transport Strategy 
seeks to reduce the number of motorised freight vehicles by 15% by 2030 and 30 % 
by 2044 and facilitate the transition to ultra-low emission and zero emission 
delivery vehicles. The City Corporation is working with local employers to support 
127  
 
   
  
 
   
    
    
  
   
 
   
 
 
   
 
  
     
  
  
 
   
   
  
   
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
 
  
     
  
  
      
   
     
 
    
     
   
  
 them in freight consolidation and to share best practice and ideas, for example 
through the Cheapside Business Alliance and the Active City Network. 
6.2.22. Retiming of deliveries and collections outside peak periods can reduce 
congestion, as can consolidation onto fewer vehicles or different types of vehicles. 
The City Corporation ’s Transport Strategy aims to reduce the number of motorised 
freight vehicles at peak times (7 -10am, 12 -2pm and 4 -7pm) by 50% by 2030 and 
90% by 2044. The use of different forms of consolidation, including ‘virtual’ as well 
as physical consolidation, will be required to minimise the number of trips required 
to service a development during construction and operation. Virtual consolidation 
involves techniques such as preferred suppliers or nominated carriers to serve a 
multi -tenanted building. Opportunities to trial and support freight innovation through 
new technology will be explored as part of the City Corporation’s Future City 
Streets programme. 
6.2.23. Large physical consolidation centres will almost always need to be located 
outside the City because of the lack of suitable land and high land values within the 
City and will the refore require the cooperation of other local authorities. The City 
Corporation ’s Transport Strategy outlines the C orporation’s i ntention to work with a 
partner haulier to provide a consolidation service for the City of London by 2022 
and to establish a su stainable logistics centre to serve the Square Mile by 2030. 
This centre would co -locate major suppliers in a single warehouse, alongside 
consolidation, waste collection and couriering services. It would be supported by 
last mile logistics hubs within the City to facilitate more deliveries on foot, by bike 
and by small electric vehicles. 
6.2.24. Personal deliveries to places of work within the City contribute to congestion on 
the streets. Businesses should discourage personal deliveries to business 
premises and ins tead encourage deliveries near home and use of click and collect 
parcel drop off services. It may be appropriate to secure this through a legal 
agreement. Where deliveries continue to take place, the provision of shared ground 
floor storage facilities in m ulti-tenanted buildings may reduce the amount of time 
spent at the kerbside by delivery vehicles. To reduce emissions from delivery 
vehicles, electric vehicle charging points will be required within service areas for 
freight vehicles. 
6.2.25. On-street shredding operations associated with building occupation creates 
noise and congestion on street and can have an adverse impact on the amenity of 
neighbouring uses . 
How the policy works 
6.2.26. Servicing areas should be designed into new buildings and provide sufficient 
space or facilities for all vehicles to enter and exit the site in a forward gear. 
Headroom should be provided of at least 5m where skips are to be lifted and 4.75m 
for all other vehicle circula tion areas. 
6.2.27. Delivery and Servicing Plans (DSP) will be required for all major commercial 
development over 1,000m2 and any other development or refurbishment that will 
cause significant transport impacts on the local or wider area through operational 
128  
 
     
  
     
   
  
 
   
   
   
  
   
    
   
  
    
 
  
   
  
    
  
 
     
     
  
    
      
 
  
   
   
  
   
   
  
    
 
   
    deliveries and servicing. For smaller development a DSP is encouraged , and may 
be required in sensitive areas, as a tool to effectively manage delivery and 
servicing movements. Where consolidation of servicing and deliveries is proposed, 
the number of vehicle trips that have been avoided as a result should be set out in 
the DSP. Consideration should be given to smart or joint procurement measures 
with other businesses to reduce the numbers of deliveries and servicing trips 
required to the premises. Details shou ld be set out in the DSP. Where any sort of 
consolidation centre is to be used, a commitment to the use of zero or low emission 
vehicles, and appropriate routeing should be included in the DSP. Within the 
Square Mile, DSP’s should take account of the City’ s street hierarchy when 
considering routeing arrangements and should address the potential for use of the 
River Thames to reduce congestion caused by servicing and deliveries. The DSP 
should set out proposals for monitoring of delivery and servicing arran gements, 
including the use of consolidation . The City Corporation will work with developers 
and occupiers to monitor the actual reductions in deliveries achieved through 
consolidation. 
6.2.28. Out of hours servicing is required , except in residential areas where n ight-time 
deliveries should be avoided, and further restrictions may be applied in areas of 
high footfall. The DSP should set out that a booking system for deliveries and 
servicing will be implemented, and that deliveries and servicing within the restricte d 
hours of 7am-10am , 12pm-2pm and 4pm-7pm on weekdays will not be permitted. 
High footfall in areas at other peak times may also require restrictions on deliveries 
and servicing. 
6.2.29. Where deliveries are required outside of the restricted hours, these should be 
subject to a quiet delivery agreement or a commitment to minimise noise and 
pollution impacts in all stages of the delivery process. Details should be set out in 
the DSP. Where appropriate, construction deliveries may be accepted outside of 
normal working hours and the management of such deliveries should be explained 
in the DSP. 
6.2.30. Provision should be made within off -street, in -building, servicing bays for 
shredding operations to reduce the potential for disturbance to neighbours. On-
street shredding will not be permitted. 
6.2.31. Further information is set out in the City of London ’s Freight and Servicing SPD. 
Policy VT3: Vehicle Parking 
1. Development in the City should be car -free except for designated Blue Badge 
spaces. Where other car parking (including mo torcycle parking) is exceptionally 
provided it must not exceed London Plan standards. 
2. No new public car parks will be permitted, including through the temporary use of 
vacant sites. 
3. Underutilised public car parks will be prioritised as sites for last mile delivery hubs 
and other alternative uses that support the delivery of the Transport Strategy . The 
129  
 
      
  
   
  
  
  
 
     
  
   
 
  
  
     
   
   
 
 
    
    
   
    
  
 
  
  
  
   
   
    
   
 
  
 
   
  
   
     redevelopment of existing public car parks for other land uses will be supported if it is 
demonstrated that they are no longer needed for a transport -relate d function . 
4. All off -street car parking facilitie s must be equipped with electric vehicle charging 
points. 
5. New taxi ranks will only be permitted in key locations such as near stations, hotels 
and large retail developments and where they do not conflict wit h other policies in the 
development plan. Off -street taxi ranks should be designed with a combined entry 
and exit point to minimise obstruction to other transport modes. 
Reason for the policy 
6.2.32. The City has excellent public transport accessibility and all de velopment should 
therefore be car -free, unless it can be demonstrated that there are exceptional 
circumstances which justify limited car parking. 
How the policy works 
6.2.33. Designated parking must be provided for Blue Badge holders within 
developments in conformity with the London Plan requirements and must be 
marked out and reserved for their use. Some older or disabled residents may need 
regular visits from carers and healt hcare professionals and the provision of visitor 
parking would support their ability to live in their own homes. Any such parking 
should be marked out as such and restricted only for these users. 
6.2.34. The City’s public car parks were mostly constructed during the 1960s. Some are 
now underused , and the City Corporation is actively developing proposals to 
establish last mile delivery hubs within those car parks . Other transport -related 
infrastructure may be suitable in under -utilised car parks . 
6.2.35. Evidence will be required to demonstrate that a car park is no longer required for 
a transport -related purpose if conversion or redevelopment to an alternative land 
use is proposed. 
Policy VT4: River Transport 
1. The City Corporation will support i mprovemen ts to river piers, steps and stairs to the 
foreshore and other river -based transport infrastructure to enable an increase in 
passenger and freight transport by river . The City Corporation will seek the 
reinstatement of Swan Lane Pier and development which prejudices this 
reinstatement will not be permitted. 
2. The City Corporation will continue to safeguard Walbrook Wharf as a river wharf and 
waste transfer site. 
3. All development within the City must consider use of the River Thames for the 
movement of construction materials and waste. Development adjacent to, or over, 
the river must be supported by a Transport Assessment and a Construction Logistics 
Plan addressing the potential of using the river f or the movement of construction 
materials and waste and servicing of the development . 
130  
 
   
      
   
 
 
  
  
 
   
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
   
 
  
       
 
  
  
   
   
  
   
 
    
 
     
 Reason for the policy 
6.2.36. Walbrook Wharf is the only active river wharf in the City and will be retained as a 
waste facility and river wharf in line with the London Plan and the Mayor’s 
Safeguarded Wharves Direction. The waste transfer site at Walbrook Wharf 
provides a means of removing domestic and commercial waste from the City by 
river, significantly reducing the need for road transport of waste. Subject to the 
need to ret ain capacity for efficient waste operations from this site, there may be 
potential to use Walbrook Wharf for freight logistics. 
6.2.37. Additional use of the river either to transport construction and demolition 
materials or for deliveries and servicing would furt her reduce the need for goods 
vehicles on the City’s streets, helping to alleviate congestion and pollution. 
6.2.38. Swan Lane Pier is a redundant pier and the City Corporation will seek its 
reinstatement. Applicants should liaise with the Port of London Authorit y regarding 
the operational and safety aspects of their proposals and with the Environment 
Agency regarding the impact of boat movements on biodiversity and river 
defences. 
6.2.39. The City Corporation will require developments adjacent to, on, or over the river, 
to consider the use of the river for freight and servicing and for the transport of 
construction and waste materials. 
Policy VT5: Aviation Landing Facilities 
Heliports will not be permitted in the City. Helipads will only be permitted where they ar e 
essential for emergency or security purposes. 
Reason for the policy 
6.2.40. Heliports are not appropriate in the City because of the noise and disturbance 
that would be created by helicopters in such a densely developed area. In order to 
demonstrate a need for helipad facilities, it must be certified by the emergency 
services and shown that the need cannot be met elsewhere. The City Corporation’s 
Transport Strategy sets out principles that will apply to the potential use of drones 
in the City. The City Corporation will keep the need for facilities for drones under 
review, taking account of developing technology, the impact on amenity, City 
streets and sky space , and the security and privacy implications .

  6.3. Active Travel and Healthy Streets 
Context 
6.3.1. The Mayor of London, through his Transport Strategy, aims to significantly 
change the function of London’s streets to reduce the dominance and negative 
impacts of motor traffic and enable walking, cycling and social interaction. The 
Healthy Streets Approach provides the framework for the City of London’s 
Transport Strategy , which places improving people’s health and their experience of 
using streets at the heart of transport decision making. These include ensuring 
people feel safe and creating stree t environments that enable people to choose 
walking, cycling and public transport instead of using the car. Good performance 
against each indicator demonstrates that individual streets are appealing places to 
walk, cycle and spend time. 
Figure 14: Mayor’s Transport Strategy Healthy Streets Indicators (Source: Lucy Saunders) 
6.3.2. The City’s workforce is expected to increase significantly over the course of the 
Plan period to 2036 , albeit that increased remote working means that actual footfall 
is unlikely to rise in proportion to total employment. Visitor numbers are also 
anticipated to rise. This will result in significant and increasing pressure on the 
pavements and the public realm at peak times in the morning, lunchtime and early 
132  
 
    
   
  
  
  
  
 
         
 
     
  
 
  
 
  
   
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 evening. Figure 15 illustrates forecast pedestrian flows across the City in 2026 
during the am peak . This forecast was produced before the Covid -19 pandemic 
and it is uncer tain to what extent the pandemic may affect medium and longer term 
pedestrian movement in the City. The pandemic has, however, emphasised the 
importance of facilitating safe and convenient public transport services into and out 
of the City together with me asures to ensure active travel and pedestrian comfort 
within the City’s boundaries. 
Figure 15: Forecast pedestrian flows in the City of London in the am peak in 2026 
Strategic Policy S10: Active Travel and Healthy Streets 
The City Corporation will work with partners to improve the quality and permeability of 
the City’s streets and spaces to prioritise walking and cycling, improve accessibility and 
encourage more active modes of travel to, from and within the City by: 
• Improving condi tions for safe, convenient, comfortable and accessible walking 
and cycling, incorporating climate change adaptation; 
• Expanding the cycle network across the City with the aim of ensuring that 
nearly all propert y entrances are within 250m of the network; 
• Implementing improvements to key walking routes and i ncreasing the number 
of pedestrian priority streets as part of the delivery of the City’s Transport 
Strategy; 
133  
 
    
  
  
  
  
 
  
   
  
  
  
    
     
 
  
 
  
   
 
   
  
  
  
   
  
   
 
  
    
 
  
  
 
  
  
    
   
  
    
  
 
  
   
 
  • Improving access routes and the public realm around stations, and between 
stations and key destinations; and 
• Implementing enhancements to the safety and appearance of streets and 
public realm in conjunction with restrictions to vehicular access, taking account 
of the needs of people with disabilities . 
Reason for the policy 
6.3.3. Most movement in the City is on foot and the street environment is predominantly 
a pedestrian environment , with over 750,000 walked journeys a day . Cycling in the 
City needs to be considered within this context. Cycling in the City increased by 
almost 300% betw een 1999 and 2017, although the rate of growth has slowed 
markedly since 2012. People cycling now make up a quarter of vehicles and this 
figure can rise to over 50% on major streets during peak pe riods. Pedestrian 
numbers have also risen in recent years a s the City’s workforce has grown. Over 
400,000 pedestrians were counted on the City’s streets during a survey in 
November 2017. 
6.3.4. Improvements to conditions for safe, convenient and comfortable walking and 
cycling are required to improve the experience of pe ople who already walk and 
cycle and encourage more people to use active modes of travel. Provision of 
necessary infrastructure is particularly challenging due to the City’s historic street 
pattern and the significant demands for space on streets from the h igh volume of 
pedestrians, cyclists and servicing and other essential vehicles. 
6.3.5. The Mayor’s Transport Strategy seeks to enable more people to walk and cycle 
and reduce the use of and reliance on cars. Prioritisation of walking and cycling 
through realloca tion of highway space is advocated where appropriate to reduce 
conflict between different modes of transport, and to create an environment where 
people choose to walk and cycle. 
How the policy works 
6.3.6. Through the City Corporation ’s Transport Strategy, the design and management 
of streets will reflect their position in the street hierarchy, as well as their function 
as places. Traffic management measures to implement the street hierarchy will be 
identified through the development o f area based Healthy Streets Plans. These will 
consider how to reduce the use of Local Access streets by through traffic, while 
maintaining access. They will also consider opportunities to introduce pedestrian 
priority, improve the experience of cycling an d walking, enhance the public realm 
and create new public space. 
6.3.7. Planning applications will be assessed against the Healthy Streets Indicators and 
developers will be required to use the Healthy Streets Check for Designers for all 
developments that have a significant impact on surrounding streets. 
6.3.8. The first four Healthy Streets Plans, to be developed by 2022, will cover the 
following areas: 
134  
 
    
   
   
  
     
  
    
         
   
      
  
  
 
  
    
     
     
   
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
    
   
      
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  • Barbican and Smithfield: supporting the delivery of the Culture Mile Look and Feel 
Strategy and the new Museum of London. The area covered will align with the 
Smithfield and Barbican Key Area of Change. 
• Bank and Guildhall: incorporating the transformation of Bank Junction and 
supporting changes to the Museum of London roundabout and St Paul’s Gyratory. 
• City Cluster and Fenchurch Street: responding to the growth of the City Cluster and 
the proposed upgrade of Fenchurch Street station and enabling the delivery of the 
City Cluster Area Strategy. This will align with the City Cluster Key Area of Change 
and incorporate part of the Aldgate, Tower and Portsoken Key Area of Change. 
• Temple and Fleet Street: in response to the Fleet Street Estate Project, which 
comprises the new Magistrates court and City of London Police headquarters, and 
enhancement of Fleet Street and the Temples area. 
6.3.9. An experimental safety scheme was introduced at Bank Junction in May 2017, 
which restricted traffic to buses and cycles only on weekdays between 7am and 
7pm. Monitoring shows that this scheme achieved a significant reduction in 
casualties at the junction, while also reducing NO 2 emissions in the area. Traffic 
restrictions at the junction have now been made permanent and a wider series of 
highways and public realm enhancements, known as All Change at Bank, will be 
implemented during the Plan period to transform the look and feel of this key 
junction at t he heart of the City. 
6.3.10. Adaptation to the anticipated climate change in the City should include pollution 
reduction and mitigation. The Healthy Streets Approach , the City’s Transport 
Strategy and the City Corpo ration’s Air Quality Strategy seek to deliver 
improvements in air quality and reductions in emissions and noise from transport. 
The City Corporation is working with partners to ensure that the City’s streets and 
the public transport system are resilient to the long -term impacts of severe weather 
and cl imate change. 
Polic y AT1: Pedestrian Movement 
1. Developers should facilitate pedestrian movement and reduce severance by 
provision of suitable routes through and around new developments. The City 
Corporation will work with developers and owners to maintain pedestrian routes at 
ground level and the upper level walkway network around the Barbican and London 
Wall. 
2. Development proposals should maintain and , wherever feasible , provide for an 
increase in pavement widths to ensure that pavements provide su fficient safety, 
comfort and convenience for the number of pedestrians using them . 
3. The loss of a pedestrian route will only be permitted where an alternative public 
pedestrian route of at least equivalent standard is provided having regard to: 
• The extent t o which the route provides for current and all reasonably 
foreseeable future demands placed upon it, including at peak periods; 
135  
 
   
    
 
 
    
   
  
 
 
 
  
    
  
  
 
 
  
   
  
 
  
  
    
  
   
  
      
   
  
 
  
  
 
    
   
    
  
   
     
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 • The shortest practicable routes between relevant points. 
4. Routes of historic importance will be safeguarded and where appropriate reinstated 
as part of the City’s characteristic pattern of lanes, alleys and courts, including the 
route’s historic alignment and width. 
5. The replacement of a route over which pedestrians have rights with one to which the 
public have access only with permission will not be acceptable . 
6. Public access across private land will be encouraged where it enhances the 
connectivity, legibility and capacity of the City’s street network. Spaces should be 
designed so that signage is not necessary, and it is cl ear to the public that access is 
allowed. 
7. The creation of new pedestrian rights of way will be encouraged where this would 
improve movement and contribute to the character of an area, taking into account the 
existing pattern of pedestrian routes and movement and connections to neighbouring 
areas a nd boroughs where relevant. 
Reason for this policy 
6.3.11. In light of the current and predicted demands on the City’s streets and public 
realm, permeability and legibility are vital in order to accommodate pedestrians and 
enable efficient movement of people on f oot and by cycle. Redevelopment 
schemes may provide opportunities to improve pedestrian safety and comfort, for 
instance by creating new routes or areas of open space, widening pavements and 
removing pinch points, or securing enhanced public access to priv ate spaces and 
routes. Policy DE4 sets ou t requirements for improved pedestrian permeability 
through buildings and development sites . 
6.3.12. The City Corporation ’s Transport Strategy promotes strategic measures to 
facilitate improved pedestrian movement, includin g pedestrian priority streets , 
increasing the number of pedestrianised or pedestrian priority streets from 25 km to 
35km by 2030 and with an initial focus on the City Cluster and Culture Mile . 
Opportunities will also be identified to introduce pedestrian priority on streets with a 
pavement width of less than two metres. 
6.3.13. The Transport Strategy identifies certain routes and junctions which will be 
prioritised for improvement , focusing on those wh ich are busiest with people 
walking and where pavement width and pedestrian crossings are inadequate for 
current or forecast demand . Improvements to the following routes and junctions will 
be delivered by 2030 (see Figure 16): 
• The area around Moorgate and Liverpool Street Stations (including 
Moorgate/London Wall junction) and the routes between these stations and key 
destinations, including the City Cluster, Culture Mile and Bank Junction . 
• Bank Junction and streets between the junction and the City Cluster. 
• The route from the Mille nnium Bridge to Culture Mile, including changes to St 
Paul’s Gyratory. 
136  
 
     
  
     
 
    
     
 
 
      
   
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
     
  
 
 
 
  
 • The route between the Barbican and the new Museum of London , including 
Beech Street and Long Lane (the ‘Culture Spine’). 
• Fleet Street, including potential changes to Ludgate Circus (in partnership with 
TfL). 
• The Bishopsgate corridor, including Monument junction (in partnership with TfL) 
• The Globe View section of the Riverside Walkway. 
Figure 16: Proposed walking improvements 2019 -2030 
6.3.14. The City’s narrow streets and alleyways pose additional opportunities and 
challenges in terms of accessibility, wayfinding and safety. Many of these are 
valuable amenity spaces and are of historic importance. Sensitive solutions will be 
sought where develo pment would have an impact on these spaces to protect their 
setting and create high quality, accessible areas for all the City’s users.  
How the policy works 
6.3.15. In considering proposals for new pedestrian routes, the City Corporation will 
ensure that routes are of adequate width, step -free and follow best practice in 
street design. Developers will be expected to consider the cumulative impacts of 
their developments on City streets alongside other existing and permitted 
137  
 
   
 
     
  
    
    
 
  
   
  
   
    
    
    
      
  
  
  
 
 
   
   
  
    
 
   
  
 
  
     
   
  
    
    
  
    
   
   
      
  
 
 
 development. Further details are set out in the City Public Realm SPD and 
accompanying Technical Manual. 
6.3.16. Pedestrian Comfort Levels are used to assess the level of crowding on a 
pavement or at a pedestrian crossing. The level of comfort, which is graded 
between A+ (most comfortable) and E (least comfortable) , is based on the number 
of people walking and the space available, taking account of street furniture and 
other restrictions. TfL’s Pedestrian Comfort Guidance recommends a minimum 
comfort level of B+ and the City Corporation ’s Transpor t Strategy aims for all City 
pavements to have a minimum pedestrian comfort level of B+ . Transpo rt 
Assessments submitted in support of planning applications should assess the level 
of pedestrian comfort and should provide a clear justification if any pavements in 
the vicinity of the development would fail to achieve a B+ rating. 
6.3.17. Appropriate management and maintenance arrangements for the public realm 
and pedestrian routes should be agreed , including for public space that is p rivately 
owned (in accordance with the Mayor of London’s Public London Charter) and 
secured through legal agreement or planning condition. 
6.3.18. Where new pedestrian routes are created , or existing routes improved, the City 
Corporation will work with organisations such as the Active City Network and the 
Cheapside Business Alliance to provide information about routes to City workers, 
residents and visitors . 
Policy AT2: Active Travel inclu ding Cycling 
All major development must promote and encourage active travel through making 
appropriate provision for people who walk, cycle and travel actively, by: 
• ensuring suitable access between the development site and pedestrian and 
cycle routes; 
• incorporating sufficient shower and changing facilities, and lockers/storage to 
support walking and cycling. 
Reason for this policy 
6.3.19. Most of the City’s employees journey into work via public transport, completing 
their journeys on foot. Pedestrians make up the majority of the road users in the 
City and as such, provision needs to be made to facilitate safe and pleasant 
pedestrian movements and active travel. 
6.3.20. A growing number of people are choosing to cycle through and around the 
Square Mile. Increased access to the East -West and North -South Cycle 
Superhighways enables cyclists to cross the City on safer strategic routes. This will 
be supplemented by a Citywide core cycle network providing safe and attractive 
routes around the Square Mile and linking into cycling networks in neighbouring 
boroughs (see Figure 17). Cycling improvements and interventions will be 
prioritised on this network , with the aim of delivering the core cycling network by 
2035 .

Figure 17: Proposed core cycling network and phasing 
6.3.21. Smaller measures and network enhancements will be identified through 
development of the Healthy Streets Plans and a review of existing Quietways , 
which run along less heavily trafficked back streets. Additional cycling infrastructure 
should see an increase in the uptake of cycling as a way of travelling around as 
well as commuting into the Ci ty and help to achieve the aims of both City of 
London’s Transport Strategy, and that of the Mayor of London. 
How the policy works 
6.3.22. New developments should provide shower and storage/locker facilities to 
encourage employees to engage in active travel modes . Lockers should be 
provided at a minimum ratio of 1 locker per 1 cycle parking space. Showers should 
be provided at a minimum of 1 shower per 10 cycle parking spaces. The City of 
London’s Active City Network actively encourages employers to promote and 
support safer commuting. The provision of personalised travel planning by 
employers for their staff can be an effective way of helping to achieve this. 
6.3.23. Developers will be required to contribute towards the enhancement of the public 
realm to encourage pedest rian and cycle travel, and towards the expansion of the 
City’s cycle network if the development is likely to benefit from the provision of a 
nearby route. Contributions may be secured through s106 planning obligations and 
s278 highways agreements where suc h provision is necessary to mitigate the 
impacts of the development.

  Policy AT3: Cycle Parking 
1. Developments must provide on -site cycle parking for occupiers and visitors , 
complying with London Plan standards , and will be encouraged to provide facilities 
for public cycle parking . 
2. All long stay on site cycle parking must be secure, undercover and preferably 
enclosed , in accordance with the London Cycle Design Standards . 
3. Developments that include ground floor retail and take -away food outlets should 
provide appropriate off -street storage for cargo bikes and hand carts. 
Reason for this policy 
6.3.24. There is need to encourage more people to cycle into the City and adopt active 
travel initiatives , to reduce congestion on City streets, deliver improvements in air 
quality , reduce carbon emissions and contribute to the wider health and wellbeing 
of City occupiers, residents and visitors. Sufficient cycle parking will be required to 
meet these needs. 
How the policy works 
6.3.25. Develop ers will be required to provide sufficient cycle parking to meet potential 
demand, including provision for non -standard cycles. A robust justification for 
failure t o comply with London Plan standards will be required. This will be 
considered on a case by case basis as part of pre -application discussions. All on -
site cycle parking must be secure, conveniently accessible and sheltered , in 
accordance with London Cyclin g Design Standards. 
6.3.26. Short -stay visitor cycle parking should be provided on -site at ground floor level . 
Visitor cycle parking should be near building entrances in publicly accessible 
spaces wherever possible. Exceptionally, i f this is not possible because of the 
layout and configuration of the site, 25% additional long stay cycle parking must be 
provided . 
6.3.27. In order to facilitate last -mile deliveries by sustainable modes of travel, premises 
that include retail and take -away food outlets will be encouraged to provide storage 
space for cargo bikes and hand carts. 
6.3.28. The Mayor’s Transport Strategy seeks to ensure t hat on -street cycle facilities 
cater for the wide range of cycles used by disabled people. 
6.3.29. This policy applies to the cycle parking provided within new developments. The 
City Corporation’s Transport Strategy addresses public cycle parking . Developers 
are encouraged to provide additional public cycle parking facilities within the 
curtilage of their developments . The City Corporation will publish a Cycle Parking 
Delivery Plan , which will review the availability and distribution of public cycle 
parking on and off-street to ensure it is sufficient to meet forecast demand.

  6.4. Historic Environment 
Context 
6.4.1. The City of London is the historic centre of London and has a rich and varied 
historic environment that reflects this. The City’s heritage assets contribute to i ts 
unique identity, adding to its character, attractiveness and competitiveness. This is 
of benefit to all the City’s communities, workers, residents and visitors. 
6.4.2. There are a large number of designated heritage assets in the City, with over 600 
listed buildings and many structures such as statues, monuments and sculptures. 
Listed buildings range from a 17th century home on Cloth Fair to Wren’s iconic St 
Paul’s Cathedral and churches , to modern buildings by renowned architects , such 
as the Barbica n Estate and the Lloyds Building. As well as listed buildings there are 
27 conservation areas, 48 Scheduled Monuments and 4 Historic Parks and 
Gardens. Furthermore, the City provides part of the backdrop and setting for the 
Tower of London World Heritage S ite. 
Strategic Policy S 11: Historic Environment 
The City’s heritage assets, their significance and settings will be positively managed , by: 
1. Conserving and enhancing heritage assets and their settings to ensure that the City’s 
townscapes and heritage can be enjoyed for their contribution to quality of life and 
wellbeing; 
2. Encouraging the beneficial , continued use of heritage assets consistent with their 
conservation and enhancement , including those on the Heritage at Risk Register ; 
3. Seeking impr oved public access, and enhanced experience and interpretation of the 
City’s cultural and heritage assets ; 
4. Protecting and promoting the assessment and evaluation of the City’s ancient 
monuments and archaeological remains and their settings, including the 
interpretation, archiving and publication of archaeological investigations; and 
5. Preserving and seeking to enhance the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) , 
architectural and historic significance, authenticity and integrity of the Tower of 
London World Heritage Site and its local setting.

Figure 18: Designated heritage assets in the City of London 
Reason for the policy 
6.4.3. The City has a rich archaeological he ritage including many designated and non -
designated monuments visible in the townscape and surviving as buried remains 
below buildings and streets. The whole of the City is regarded as having 
archaeological potential. 
6.4.4. The City contains a rich variety of ar chitectural styles and materials, a medieval 
street pattern and a long history as a centre for commerce and trade. The diversity 
of the buildings and townscape creates a rich juxtaposition between the historic 
and the modern. This and the dense nature of d evelopment helps to differentiate 
the City of London from other global commercial centres and makes the City a 
unique place to live, work and visit. 
6.4.5. The City’s rich heritage contributes to the City’s primary function as a business 
centre, its cultural role , as a home to its small resident population and increasingly 
its role as a visitor destination. Approximately two thirds of the City’s listed 
buildings have a commercial use, including offices, retail, and hotels and provide 
vital small and medium -sized o ffice space. The City has one of the greatest 
concentrations of architecturally significant places of worship in the country, with 44 
listed medieval and Wren churches , Bevis Marks Synagogue and an equally 
unique collection of over 60 churchyards embedded within a dense townscape. 
142  
 
    
  
    
   
 
 
  
     
  
 
  
 
   
     
 
 
  
   
   
  
   
     
 
  
 
   
      
  
 
 
   
   
      
  
    
  
     
 6.4.6. Heritage assets can significantly contribute to London’s economy, providing 
valuable office space suitable for small to medium -sized occupants as well as 
creative industries , and providing potential space for hotels and retail use s. In order 
to build upon the wider social, cultural and economic benefits of the historic 
environment, public access to , and experience of, the City’s heritage will be sought 
as part of development proposals in line with the wider policies in this Plan. 
How the policy works 
6.4.7. The policy enables adaptations to be made to heritage assets where the 
alterations are consistent with the conservation and significance of those assets. 
The sensitive adaptation of heritage assets contributes to the continual growth of 
the City’s economy. This and continued investment will ensure that buildings retain 
an active use so that the City’s buildings and heritage can be appreciated by 
present and future generations. 
6.4.8. The City Corporation will encourage proposals to achieve the conservation and 
appropriate use of buildings and monuments on the Heritage at Risk Register to 
ensure their repair, long term well -being an d where possible, avoid future 
deterioration. 
6.4.9. In addition to the heritage assets within in the City, just outside the boundary lies 
the Tower of London, a UNESCO World Heritage Site of Outstanding Universal 
Value (OUV) . 
Policy HE1: Managing Change to Heritage Assets 
Development proposals which affect heritage assets or their settings should be 
supported by a Heritage Assessment, to evaluate the significance of relevant heritage 
assets and their settings, to inform the proposals and maximise enhancement s. 
Proposals should meet the following criteria: 
Development should conserve and enhance the special architectural or historic 
interest and the significance of heritage assets and their settings. 
Development in conservation areas should preserve or enhance the character or 
appearance of the conservation area. The loss of buildings and elements which 
contribute to the character, appearance or significance of a conservation area will be 
resisted; 
Development should not adversely affect Historic Parks and Gard ens included on the 
Historic England Register and historic open spaces ; 
The demolition or loss of designated heritage assets will be refused , having regard to 
the tests set out in national policy . 
Where proposals would result in harm to, or the loss of, a non-designated heritage 
asse t, the City Corporation will have regard to the scale of any harm or loss, the 
significance of the heritage asset and the wider public benefits proposed. 
143  
 
   
  
  
  
   
     
   
   
 
   
 
  
  
 
 
    
    
  
    
  
  
  
   
    
 
     
 
 
 
 
   
    
  
  
     
 
   
  
   
Development should not cause the loss of routes and spaces that contribute to the 
character and historic interest of the City. The reinstatement of historic routes and the 
creation of new routes will be sought . 
Reason for the policy 
6.4.10. It is important that applicants provide a clear and comprehensive understanding 
of the heritage significance of a building, proportionate to the nature and scale of 
the proposed development. This may require detailed archival research to 
understand the historical evolution of the building in order to inform the proposals 
as well as the impac t of the development on the heritage asset. 
6.4.11. National policy applies different tests to development proposals that would result 
in substantial harm to (or total loss of) the significance of a designated heritage 
asset and proposals that would cause less tha n substantial harm. Where the harm 
is less than substantial it should be weighed against the public benefits of the 
proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use. National 
policy indicates that great weight should be given to the a sset’s conservation 
irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss 
or less than substantial harm to its significance. 
6.4.12. Where a development proposal would affect a non -designated heritage asset, 
national policy requires a balanced judgement to be made having regard to the 
scale of harm and the significance of the asset. The City Corporation will aim to 
identify non -designated heritage assets at the earliest stage in the planning 
process, with reference to current national c riteria. This may be supported by 
additional research or investigations as appropriate and be based on a clear 
understanding of the building, structure, open space or archaeological remains, 
including group value. 
6.4.13. The designation of conservation areas carr ies with it the statutory duty to 
consider how an area or areas can be preserved and enhanced. The City 
Corporation will take the opportunity presented by development proposals within a 
conservation area to strengthen the special character of that conserva tion area and 
its setting. 
6.4.14. In the design of new buildings or the alteration of existing buildings, developers 
should have regard to the character of conservation areas and their settings. This 
includes the size and shape of historic building plots, existin g street patterns and 
the alignment and the width of frontages, materials, vertical and horizontal 
emphasis, layout and detailed design, bulk and scale, including the effects of site 
amalgamation on scale, and hard and soft landscaping. Regard should be pa id to 
the richness, variety and complexity of the architectural form and detailing of 
buildings and to the broader character of the area. 
6.4.15. Many buildings in conservation areas, make a significant contribution to the 
character of these areas. Proposals for t he demolition of a non -listed building will 
be considered in terms of the building’s significance, its contribution to the 
character or appearance of the area and the level of potential harm. 
144  
 
     
 
 
  
  
    
  
   
  
    
 
 
    
 
   
  
   
  
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
   
   
  
 
  
   
  
  
  
 
    
    
   
   
   
  
 
  6.4.16. Even minor changes to listed buildings can have a significant im pact on their 
character and appearance. Listing descriptions are unlikely to refer to every feature 
of significance and buildings’ interiors and plan forms are also of importance. 
Inspections of listed buildings will be necessary to identify the special in terest and 
significance of the building and its curtilage. 
6.4.17. Extensions to listed buildings should be of an appropriate scale and character 
and will be acceptable where the overall impact on the building does not harm its 
significance . The bulk, height, location and materials of roof extensions will be 
particularly important and should be appropriate to the period and style of the 
building and its setting. Where listed buildings are no longer used for their original 
or previous purpose, it is imp ortant to find alternative uses that safeguard their 
future, while being compatible with the character of the building. 
6.4.18. The City’s heritage assets are not just appreciated and understood from the 
ground, but also from above. Development proposals should fa cilitate public 
appreciation of the City’s historic roofscapes. The effect of a development on the 
setting of an asset from high level locations is a material consideration. 
6.4.19. Development proposals that affect the City’s historic parks and gardens will be 
assessed to ensure that overshadowing does not cause undue harm, that their 
historic character is maintained, and that the setting, enjoyment, and views into and 
from these gardens are respected. Development should not detract from the layout, 
design, charac ter, appearance or setting of the park or garden or prejudice its 
future restoration. 
6.4.20. The pattern of streets, lanes, alleyways and other open spaces, such as squares 
and courts, is a distinctive element of the City’s townscape and is of historic 
significan ce in itself. The City Corporation will seek to maintain the widths and 
alignments of streets, lanes and other spaces where these have historic value or 
underpin the character of a location or their surroundings. Some historic routes 
have been lost to the detriment of the City’s historic townscape. Where possible, 
the City Corporation will seek to re -open or reintroduce such routes when the 
opportunity arises. 
How the policy works 
6.4.21. Developers will be required to provide supporting information describing the 
significance of any heritage assets where fabric or setting would be affected, along 
with the contribution made by their setting to their significance and the potential 
impact of the proposed development on that significance. A heritage asset’s 
significan ce can be evidential, historic, aesthetic or communal. The information 
provided should be proportionate to the level of change or impact a proposal will 
have on the heritage asset or assets.

 Policy HE2: Ancient Monuments and Archaeology 
1. Development proposals which involve excavation or ground works affecting sites of 
archaeological potential must be accompanied by an archaeological assessment and 
evaluation of the site, addressing the impact of the proposed development, mitigation 
of harm and identification of enhancement opportunities . 
2. The City Corporation will preserve, protect, safeguard and enhance archaeological 
monuments, remains and their settings, seeking enhancement, inclusive access to, 
public display and interpretation where app ropriate . 
3. Proper investigation and recording of archaeological remains will be required as an 
integral part of a development programme , together with timely publication and 
archiving of results to advance understanding. 
Reason for the policy 
6.4.22. The entire City is considered to have archaeological potential, except where 
there is evidence that archaeological remains have been lost due to deep 
basement construction or other groundworks. The City Corporation will indicate the 
potential of a site, its si gnificance and relative importance and the likely impact on 
archaeology at an early stage so that the appropriate assessment, evaluation and 
design development can be undertaken. 
How the policy works 
6.4.23. Planning applications that involve excavation or ground works must be 
accompanied by an archaeological assessment and evaluation of the site, 
including the impact of the proposed development. An evaluation should include 
trial work in agreed specific areas of the site to provide more information and to 
inform c onsideration of the development proposals by the City Corporation. 
6.4.24. In some cases, a development may reveal a monument or archaeological 
remains which will be displayed on the site, or reburied. On sites where significant 
monuments or archaeological remains exist, development must be designed to 
enhance physical preservation and avoid disturbance or loss. This can be done by 
the sympathetic design of basements, raising ground levels, site coverage, and the 
location of foundations to avoid or minimise archaeo logical loss and securing their 
preservation for the future. Undesignated archaeological remains equivalent to a 
scheduled monument will be given equal weight to designated heritage assets. 
6.4.25. The interpretation and presentation to the public of a visible or buried monument 
and enhancement of its setting should form part of development proposals. 
Agreement will be sought, where appropriate, to achieve public access. The City 
Corporation will refuse schemes which do not provide an adequate assessment of 
a site, make any provision for the incorporation, safeguarding or preservation of 
significant monuments or remains, or which would harm or adversely affect those 
monuments or remains. Where display of a monument or of archaeological 
remains would harm the heritag e asset or make it vulnerable and reburial is

  necessary, there should be interpretation to widen knowledge and contribute to the 
interest of the townscape. 
6.4.26. A programme of archaeological work for investigation, excavation and recording 
and publication of th e results to a predetermined research framework and by an 
approved organisation should be submitted to and approved by the City 
Corporation, prior to development. This will be condition ed and will ensure the 
preservation of those remains by record. The pro gramme of archaeological work 
should include all on -site work, including details of any temporary works which may 
have an impact on the archaeology of the site and all off -site work including the 
post-excavation analysis, publication and archiving of the r esults. 
Policy HE3: Setting of the Tower of London World Heritage Site 
1. Development proposals affecting the setting of the Tower of London World Heritage 
Site should preserve and seek to enhance the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) , 
architectural and historic significance, authenticity and integrity of the Tower of 
London World Heritage Site. 
2. Development proposals within the defined Local Setting Area of the Tower of 
London World Heritage Site should seek opportunities to enhance the immediate 
surroundings of the World Heritage Site, through improvements to the public realm 
and connectivity. 
Reason for the policy 
6.4.27. The Tower of London is a UNESCO World Heritage Site of Outstanding 
Universal Value. While the Tower itself is within the Lon don Borough of Tower 
Hamlets, part of the defined Local Setting Area is within the City and is shown on 
the Policies Map. The local setting of the Tower comprises the spaces from which it 
can be seen from street and river level, and the buildings that encl ose or provide 
definition to those spaces. The area around the Tower includes some streets with 
heavy traffic flows, and there is scope for improvements to be made to the public 
realm and to safety and accessibility for non -motorised road users. Developmen ts 
within a wider area may affect the setting of the Tower, depending on their scale, 
form and location. 
How the policy works 
6.4.28. Any potential impacts on the setting of the Tower of London World Heritage Site 
need to be considered in the relevant documents ac companying planning 
applications, such as in Heritage Statements, Townscape and Visual Impact 
Assessments or Transport Assessments. 
6.4.29. The Tower of London World Heritage Site Management Plan 2016, the Mayor of 
London Supplementary Planning Guidance ‘World Heritage Sites – Guidance and 
Settings 2012’ and the Tower of London ‘Local Setting Study 2010’, provide 
guidance on how the setting of the World Heritage Site can be positively managed, 
protecting its OUV , while accommodating change. The International Council on 
147  
 
   
  
 
  
 
    
  Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) publication ‘Guidance on Heritage Impact 
Assessments for Cultural World Heritage Properties’ offers guidance on the 
process of commissioning Heritage Impact Assessments (HIAs) for World Heritage 
properties, in order to evaluate the impact of potential development on the OUV of 
properties.

 6.5. Tall Buildings and Protected Views 
Strategic Policy S 12: Tall Buildings 
1. Tall buildings within the City of London are defined as buildings over 75m above 
Ordnance Datum (AOD) 
2. Tall buildings of world class architecture and sustainable and accessible design will 
be encouraged on suitable sites, having regard to: 
• the potential effect on the City skyline, the wider London skyline and historic 
skyline features; 
• the cha racter and amenity of their surroundings, including the relationship with 
existing tall buildings; 
• the impact on the significance of heritage assets and their immediate and 
wider settings; 
• the provision of a high -quality public realm at street level; and 
• the environmental impact the tall building may have on the surrounding area, 
including the capacity of the City’s streets and spaces to accommodate the 
development. 
3. Where tall buildings are acceptable in principle, their design must ensure safe and 
comfor table levels of wind, daylight and sunlight, solar glare and solar convergence 
within nearby buildings and the public realm within the vicinity of the building. Tall 
buildings should not interfere with telecommunications and provide appropriate 
mitigation where this is not feasible. Consideration should be given to how the design 
of tall buildings can assist with the dispersal of air pollutants. 
4. New tall buildings will be required to enhance permeability and provide the maximum 
feasible amount of open space at street level and incorporate areas of publicly 
accessible open space or other facilities within the building and its curtilage , including 
at upper levels , available at no charge. 
5. Tall buildings must not adversely affect the operation of Lond on’s airports, nor 
exceed the Civil Aviation Authority’s maximum height limitation for tall buildings in 
central London. 
6. New tall buildings will be refused in inappropriate areas, comprising conservation 
areas; the St Paul’s Heights area; St Paul’s protect ed vista viewing corridors; the 
protected vista and White Tower protected silhouette of the Tower of London; and 
Monument views and setting ; all as defined on the Policies Map. 
Reason for the policy 
6.5.1. The City contains many tall buildings, which help to enha nce its environment and 
economy and contribute to London’s world city role. While tall buildings are a 
characteristic and iconic element of the City’s skyline, they must not adversely 
impact on the City’s unique environment or built heritage. All of the Ci ty is sensitive 
149  
 
   
    
    
  
    
   
     
 
    
  
 
 
 
       
  
   
  
 
   
     
   to the development of tall buildings within and outside the City . Areas outside of the 
City may also be sensitive to the development of tall buildings within the City. The 
location and impact of future tall buildings therefore needs to be carefully 
considered. Policy HE3 sets out criteria for development proposals affecting the 
setting of the Tower of London World Heritage Site. 
6.5.2. Tall buildings are defined as those exceeding 75m AOD in height. Figure 19: Tall 
build ings distribution in the City of London September 2019 19 shows the ir current 
distribution. The City Corporation is required to refer applications to the Mayor for 
buildings that exceed 150m above ground height across the City and 25m above 
ground height in the Thames Policy Area. The intention of this lower threshold is to 
preserve the open aspect of the river and the riverside public realm. Tall buildings 
in the City may have impacts on locations within adjacent boroughs . Developers 
should ensure that any cross -boundary impacts are fully addressed. 
Figure 19: Tall build ings distribution in the City of London September 2019 
6.5.3. Guidance issued by the Design Council/CABE and Historic England encourages 
local planning authorities to consider the scope for tall buildings as part of strategic 
planning and to identify locations wh ere they are, or are not, appropriate. The 
London Plan indicates that areas should be identified where new tall buildings will 
be an appropriate form of development in principle. 
6.5.4. All of the City of London is sensitive to development of tall buildings and t he City 
Cluster represents the most appropriate area for encouraging tall buildings in the 
City. This does not mean that all sites within the cluster are suitable. All new tall 
150  
 
   
    
 
 
   
     
  
    
 
       
 
 building proposals will need to satisfy the requirements of Policy S12 and other 
policies in this Plan and the London Plan. Policy S21 provides more details about 
the considerations that apply specifically to new tall building proposals in the City 
Cluster. 
6.5.5. Outside of the City Cluster, there is less scope for new tall buildings d ue 
principally to conservation area and views protection considerations. Figure 21: 
Areas inappropriate for new tall buildings 21 identifies those areas of the City that 
are considered inappropriat e for new tall buildings due to these policies , based on 
a composite of the various policy designations illustrated in Figure 20.

Figure 21: Areas inappropriate for new tall buildings 
How the policy works 
6.5.6. Tall buildings are high -profile developments with a wide r impact , visible on the 
skyline across large parts of London. They provide City landmarks and should be 
designed to enhance the City’s skyline. 
6.5.7. Tall building s must no t adversely impact on the operation of London’s airport s, 
taking account of airport surface limitation heights. Consultation with London City 
Airport will be required on all proposals over 90m AOD and with Heathrow Ltd on 
all proposals over 150m AOD. Subje ct to this consultation, the maximum height of 
buildings , any equipment used during the construction process and any 
subsequent maintenance or demolition must not exceed the Civil Aviation 
Authority’s (CAA’s) aviation safeguarding policy for central London , which sets a 
maximum height limitation of 309.6m (1,016 ft) AOD. Developers should undertake 
early liaison with the CAA , Heathrow and London City Airports regarding building 
heights and the height of cranes or other equipment to be used during constructi on, 
subsequent operation or demolition . 
6.5.8. The development of tall buildings must take account of City Corporation Planning 
Advice Notes on the potential microclimate and thermal comfort impacts from 
development at an early stage in the design process. Planning Advice Notes set 
out requirements for assessing the impacts of tall buildings on solar glare, solar 
152  
 
     
   
   
   
   
   
 
   
  
   
  
   
  
  
 
   
   
    
   
  
 
  
  
   
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
  
   
      
  
  
      
 
   
   
  
  
 convergence, sunlight , wind and thermal comfort explaining how they should be 
considered as part of the design process. Tall buildings should not interfere with 
telecommunications during construction and operation. Developers will be required 
to submit a Telecommunications Interference Survey identifying the impact of the 
development a nd any proposed mitigation measures. 
6.5.9. Proposals for new tall buildings should take account of the cumulative impact of 
other proposed, permitted and existing tall buildings. The City Corporation will 
require proposals to maintain and enhance the provision o f public open space 
around the building, avoid the creation of building canyons, maintain and enhance 
pedestrian permeability and deliver consolidation of servicing and deliveries to 
reduce potential vehicle movements. 
6.5.10. Tall buildings must provide for the a menity of occupiers, visitors to the building 
and the wider public. They should contain permeable ground floors which provide 
an active frontage, such as retail facilities. Tall buildings should provide free to 
enter, publicly accessible areas , which may i nclude retail, leisure or educational 
facilities or areas of open space including roof gardens or public viewing galleries . 
There is a particular opportunity to provide publicly accessible spaces at upper 
levels, offering wider views across London . 
6.5.11. The City Corporation will use 3D digital modelling technology to visual ly assess 
the impact of tall buildings on the local, City -wide and London -wide townscape and 
skyscape . This assessment will support detailed consideration of development 
proposals again st the policies in this Plan. Developers should submit virtual models 
of their development in a n open source or other format compatible with the City 
Corporation’s 3D digital model to enable this assessment. 
Strategic Policy S 13: Protected Views 
The Cit y Corporation will protect and enhance significant City and strategic London 
views of important buildings, townscape and skylines by: 
• Implementing the Mayor of London’s London View Management Framework 
SPG to manage designated views of strategically import ant landmarks (St. 
Paul’s Cathedral and the Tower of London), river prospects, townscape views 
and linear views ; 
• Protecting and enhancing: significant local views of St. Paul’s Cathedral, 
through the City Corporation’s “St. Paul’s Heights” code and local v iews from 
the Fleet Street , Ludgate Circus and Ludgate Hill processional route ; the 
setting and backdrop to the Cathedral; significant local views of and from the 
Monument and views of historic City landmarks and skyline features ; and 
• Securing an appropriate setting of and backdrop to the Tower of London World 
Heritage Site, ensuring its Outstanding Universal Value and taking account of 
the Tower of London World Heritage Si te Management Plan (2016). 
153  
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
   
    
   
 
      
  
   
    
  
   
   
  
 
 
   Reason for the policy 
6.5.12. The City and its surrounding area contain many famous landmarks that are 
visible from viewpoints across London. Views of the City’s skyline from the River 
Thames are especially notable and certain local vie ws of St. Paul’s Cathedral have 
been protected successfully by the City Corporation’s ‘St. Paul’s Heights’ code 
since the 1930s. The London Plan sets out the overall view protection 
requirements which apply to Strategically Important Landmarks. Landmarks s uch 
as St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Monument and the Tower of London are internationally 
renowned and add to the City’s world class status. 
6.5.13. The approach to views protection in this Plan is a clarification of the long-
standing policy , rather than seeking chang es to policy. It is supported by more 
detailed guidance in the Protected Views SPD. 
Figure 22: Areas covered by protected views 
How the policy works 
6.5.14. Protected Vistas are defined geometrically from an assessment point at the view 
location to the Strategically Important Landmark that is the focus of the protected 
vista. Each Protected Vista includes a Landmark Viewing Corridor, within which 
development should not exceed the height of the threshold plane. Beside and 
behind Landmark Viewing Corridor s are the Wider Setting Consultation Areas, 
154  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
      
 
     
  
 
  
   
  
   
 
    
 
 
   
  
  
  
     
 
 
      
    
  
     
     
      
   
 
     
 
  
  
     
  
 
 
   
 within which development that exceeds the defined LVMF threshold plane should 
not compromise the viewer’s ability to recognise and appreciate the Strategically 
Important Landmark. 
6.5.15. Other designated strategic views have defined assessment points but are 
protected by qualitative assessment of the impact of a proposal on the important 
elements of the view. For the City, most of the relevant views are ‘River Prospects’ 
from Thames bridges and the riverside walk. The May or of London’s London View 
Management Framework (LVMF) SPG (2012) provides more detail, including 
detailed management plans for each strategic view of landmarks such as St. Paul’s 
Cathedral and the Tower of London. 
6.5.16. The LVMF defines a Protected Vista and a White Tower Protected Silhouette for 
the Tower of London. Any development in the Wider Setting Consultation Area in 
the background of this Protected Vista and the White Tower Protected Silhouette 
should preserve or enhance the viewer’s ability to recognis e the landmark and 
appreciate its Outstanding Universal Value. City sites have the potential to be 
intrusive in the view because of their relative proximity to the Tower. Therefore, 
proposed new development in the City which exceeds the defined LVMF thresh old 
plane for this view will not be acceptable as it will not preserve this view. The City 
Corporation’s Protected Views SPD provides further details and guidance on the 
protected views within the City. 
6.5.17. The Tower of London has additional view protection, i mplemented through the 
Tower of London World Heritage Site Management Plan (2016). This defines and 
protects a range of settings of the Tower World Heritage Site, which includes its 
relationship to historic features that are visible in the urban landscape. All new 
buildings in the setting of the Tower should contribute to the quality of views both of 
and from the Tower. 
6.5.18. The City Corporation will protect local views of St Paul’s Cathedral when 
approaching along Fleet Street , Ludgate Circus and Ludgate Hill which forms part 
of the long established royal and state processional route between Westminster 
and the City . The views of St Paul’s are kinetic, changing as the viewer moves 
along the length of this route , depending on the topography and alignment of 
build ings. Development proposals that could be visible from places along this route 
should ensure that they do not impinge on the ability of the viewer to recognise and 
appreciate the silhouette of St Paul’s Cathedral, and that they maintain the current 
clear sky background profile. An indicative view background centre line is shown 
on Figure 2 2 to highlight this issue. Further details will be set out in an update to 
the Protected Views SPD , which will include a Statement of Significance and 3D 
digital modelling information to inform the future conservation and enhancement of 
this approach . 
6.5.19. New development proposals should be well designed in their own right. Their 
bulk and form should not be base d solely on the parameters set by the 
requirements and consideration of the protected views. In determining planning 
applications for tall buildings, the City Corporation will take account of guidance 
from the Design Council/CABE , Historic England and the Greater London 
Authority . 
155  
 
   
 
 
 
   
   
 
  
 
   6.5.20. The City Corporation will co -operate with the Mayor, London boroughs and other 
local planning authorities, where proposed development outside of the City impacts 
on strategically important views of St Paul’s Cathedral, to ensure that development 
does not adversely impact on the view. 
6.5.21. The City Corporation will supplement its assessment of strategic and locally 
protected views with a visual assessment carried out using 3D digital modelling 
technology. Developers should submit virtual models for all major development in 
an open source or other format compatible with the City Corporation’s 3D digital 
model .

 6.6. Open Spaces and Green Infrastructure 
Context 
6.6.1. The City of London is a dense urban environment containing many small open 
spaces and pocket parks. These spaces are vital to the City, offering residents, 
workers and visitors outside spaces in which to work or to relax and appreciate the 
streetscape. There is a growing recognition th at green infrastructure helps to 
mitigate some effects of climate change, provides benefits for well -being and 
mental health and improves air quality. These same small green spaces are 
essential for wildlife found in this urban setting. The policy seeks to provide further 
green infrastructure, open space provision and biodiversity within the City. 
Strategic Policy S 14:  Open Space s and Green Infrastructure 
The City Corporation will work in partnership with developers, landowners , the churches 
and other age ncies to promote a greener City by: 
• Protecting existing open and green space; 
• Seeking the provision of new open and green space through development, 
public realm or transportation improvements; 
• Increasing public access to existing and new open spaces; 
• Crea ting, maintaining and encouraging high quality green infrastructure; 
• Using planting and habitat creation to enhance biodiversity , combat the 
impacts of climate change and improve air quality ; 
• Promoting the greening of the City through new development oppor tunities 
and refurbishments ; and 
• Ensuring new development and refurbishment protect and enhance the City’s 
biodiversity. 
Reason for the policy 
6.6.2. The City is densely built up and most of its open space provision consists of small 
spaces at street level. Green infrastructure in the City includes civic spaces, parks 
and gardens, churchyards, burial grounds , green roofs and walls in addition to 
amenity spaces. A key environmental asset is the River Thames. 
6.6.3. Open and green space is under increasing pressure due to the intensification of 
development, an expanding workforce and growing visitor numbers projected o ver 
the Plan period . It is important that access to these spaces is protected and 
expanded as they provide multiple positive impacts on physical health and mental 
wellbeing, including providing opportunities for exercise, to reduce stress levels, 
and to fa cilitate social interaction. 
6.6.4. The City of London Corporation is committed to protecting existing open spaces 
and expanding the provision of green infrastructure as far as possible consistent 
with heritage significance. The City Corporation seeks further urban greening to 
157  
 
  
   
     
 
     
     
    
    
  
   
  
 
  
  
  
    
 
 
   
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
   
 
   
    
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
    make the Squar e Mile more attractive to workers, residents and visitors. This would 
contribute to the Mayor of London’s ambition to make over 50 per cent of London 
green by 2050 and support London’s designation in 2019 as the world’s first 
National Park City . 
6.6.5. Given that space is at a premium in the City, all new developments and 
refurbishments will be required to include a greening element to the building and/or 
the public realm where consistent with good design and area character . This 
approach will have many benefits o ver time such as improving the urban 
environment for biodiversity, reducing rainwater run -off, reducing air and noise 
pollution, regulating temperature, and making the City a more desirable business 
location by improving visual amenity. Public access to gr eening elements should 
be achieved wherever possible. 
How the policy works 
6.6.6. The City of London Corporation will work with developers and landowners at all 
stages of the development process and actively monitor developments from pre -
application stage through to post completion to ensure that the highest standards 
of green infrastructure are achieved, and existing provision is improved. 
Open Spaces 
Policy OS1: Protection and provision of open spaces 
The quantity, quality and accessibility of public open space will be maintained and 
improved. 
• Existing open space will be protected, particularly spaces of historic inte rest. 
• Where a loss of existing open space is proposed, it must be replaced on 
redevelopment by open space of equal or improved quantity and quality on or 
near the site; 
• Additional publicly accessible open space and pedestrian routes will be sought 
in major commercial and residential developments wherever practical but 
particularly in areas of open space deficiency and where pedestrian modelling 
show s significant pressure on City streets ; 
• Further public spaces will be created from underused highways and othe r 
land; 
• Public access will be secured, wherever possible, to existing and proposed 
private spaces; 
• Access to new and existing open spaces will be improved; and 
• Open spaces must be designed to meet the needs of all the City’s 
communities. 
158  
 
   
      
  
  
  
  
    
 
 
  
   
 
   
 
 
  
     
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
   
   
     
  
  
  
     
     
     Reason for the po licy 
6.6.7. The City of London has 376 open spaces totalling just under 34 hectares which 
includes parks, gardens, churchyards and hard open spaces such as plazas and 
improvements to the highway. Most of the open spaces are small, with 
approximately 80% of sites less than 0.2 hectares in size and only 11% over half a 
hectare. There is a need for additional open space in the City to provide facilities 
for the growing daytime population, to help reduce the effects of pollution and 
climate change, to provide facilities for relaxation, tranquillity, agile working, leisure 
and sport, a nd to increase biodiversity. 
How the policy works 
6.6.8. Many open spaces in the City are of historic value, such as churchyards, while 
others are of more recent origin. New or improved spaces are created through a 
programme of public realm enhancements undertaken by the City Corporation and 
others. Policy DE3 sets out standards for public realm improvements. These new 
spaces may be public highway land or private space around buildings. They offer 
the opportunity to create areas which meet a range of needs . 
6.6.9. The provision of open space across the City is uneven. T he northern area of the 
City contains just over half of all the open space in the City, due to the relatively 
large amounts of space in the Barbican and Golden Lane estates and the 
Broadgate commercial estate. There is significant open space along the Tham es 
and the riverside, with the Riverside Walk, the Temples legal precinct and space 
close to the Tower of London. A new area of public realm will be created at 
Blackfriars foreshore as a result of the Thames Tideway Tunnel project. Although 
open space pro vision in the Aldgate area has been significantly enhanced with the 
opening of Aldgate Square, this area and the City Cluster areas have the lowest 
proportions of open space and face pressure from the increasing employment and 
pedestrian numbers associated with commercial intensification (see Figure 1 5). 
Additional open space is especially important in these areas, both at street level 
and at higher levels through the provision of accessible roof gardens/terraces. 
6.6.10. There is intense pressure on all the City’s open spaces particularly at lunchtimes 
and new development provides opportunities to create additional open space in 
and around buildings . These spaces should be designed for multiple uses , be 
maintained to a high standard and be resilient to futur e climate conditions.

Figure 23: Open Spaces in the City of London 
Policy OS2: City Greening 
1. The provision of urban greening should be integral to the design and layout of 
buildings and the public realm. 
• All development proposals will be required to demonstrate the highest feasible 
levels of greening consistent with good design and the local context; 
• The installation of biodiverse extensive or intensive green roofs, terraces and 
green walls will be sought , where appropriate, and new development should 
not compromise these elements on existing buildings located nearb y; and 
• The loss of green walls and roofs , in whole or in part, will only be permitted in 
exceptional circumstances . 
2. Major development proposals will be required to: 
• Include an Urban Greening Factor (UGF) calculation demonstrating how the 
development will meet the City’s target UGF score of 0.3 as a minimum; and 
• Submit an operation and maintenance plan to demonstrate that the green 
features will r emain successful throughout the life of the building. 
160  
 
   
   
  
 
   
   
 
   
   
  
  
    
 
 
   
     
   
 
   
 
 
 
    
  
     
     
 
  
    
  
  
  
    
  
 
 
    
   
      
 
  
  
 Reason for the policy 
6.6.11. Urban greening provides a wide range of benefits for air quality, noise, urban 
heat island effect, rainwater run -off, biodiversity enhancement, recreation, and 
health and wellbeing of the City’s communities. This will increase in importance as 
weather patt erns continue to change with rising average temperatures, summer 
droughts and more intense rainfall events periodically through the year. The 
inclusion of blue infrastructure such as rain gardens and rainwater harvesting can 
help to minimise water use. 
6.6.12. Evidence demonstrates a positive correlation between urban greening and good 
mental and physical health. The provision of large green spaces in the City’s high -
density urban environment is difficult to achieve. Small areas of soft landscaping, 
green walls an d green roofs, associated with buildings and the public realm, will 
play a vital role in promoting wellbeing. Increased access to green spaces will be 
sought . 
6.6.13. The City Corporation has long championed green roofs and continues to actively 
encourage them, but other forms of greening are less common in and around new 
buildings. The City Corporation will seek the provision of trees and landscaping in 
all development where this is possible. Vertical greening such as green walls will 
be sought on buildings which do not provide for overnight sleeping 
accommodation. Green walls bring many of the same benefits to the environment 
as green roofs and can improve the appearan ce of locations where there is limited 
opportunity for horizontal planting. To be successful they require careful design , 
installation and regular maintenance. 
6.6.14. Green roofs should be designed, installed and maintained appropriately and can 
be designed as su stainable or ecological features, and recreational spaces. To 
ensure that the maximum practicable coverage of green roof and terraces can be 
achieved, location -appropriate plants should be installed on sloping roofs, between 
cradle tracks and underneath so lar panel installations. 
6.6.15. There are two main types of green roofs, intensive green roofs which can be 
used as recreational spaces with similar features to parks and gardens, and 
extensive ones (includ ing BioSolar green roofs) having plants such as sedums an d 
wildflowers but with limited or no access. Varying extensive green roof substrate 
levels will be encouraged to improve rainwater retention and enhance biodiversity, 
using a high proportion of native plants. Where developers seek to install intensive 
green roofs with deep substrates for amenity space, these are expected to be of 
high-quality design incorporating rainwater harvesting for irrigation to minimise 
water use. 
6.6.16. The green roof should not impact adversely on protected views and planting 
should be ap propriate to the location and height of the roof. All green roofs should 
be designed, installed and maintained appropriately for the life of the buildi ng to 
maximise the roof’s environmental benefits including biodiversity, rain -water run -off 
attenuation a nd building insulation. 
161  
 
   
    
 
 
 
       
  
   
     
  
    
     
 
     
    
   
  
    
    
  
   
   
  
   
  
  
  
   
  
 
  
 
   
  
 
    
  
   
   
 
 
 How the policy works 
6.6.17. This policy promotes greening for all new buildings and public realm schemes. It 
takes account of the value of different types of greening through the application of 
an Urban Greening Factor (UGF), with a highe r UGF for greening that provides 
multiple benefits. 
6.6.18. The London Plan has introduced a UGF scoring system for London, which will 
operate as a tool to assess the amount, type and value of greenery within 
development proposals. The London Plan recommends interim target scores, 
pending work by individual boroughs and the City Corporation to develop their own 
approaches tailored to loca l circumstances. 
6.6.19. The City Corporation ’s UGF Study indicates that an UGF target of 0.3 would be 
deliverable for the majority of development in the City . The Study considered the 
potential for an UGF on a range of development types, including office s, 
reside ntial, hotel s and mixed commercial . Policy OS2 requires major development 
proposals in the City (commercial and residential) to include an UGF calculation 
demonstrating how it will meet the minimum UGF target of 0.3. 
6.6.20. Developers will need to provide evidenc e to justify why the UGF target cannot 
be met. The City Corporation will take a flexible approach where delivery of the 
target UGF would detract from the heritage significance of a building or 
conservation area . 
6.6.21. Development proposals could include greening of roofs, facades, terraces and 
balconies, both internal and external, and/or landscaping around the building 
depending on the circumstances of each site. The UGF assessment should be 
submitted as part of the planning application, along with landscap ing proposals and 
an operation and maintenance plan to show how the greenery will be maintained . 
This will ensure that suitable green elements are designed in and will remain 
attractive and viable throughout the life of the development. 
6.6.22. More details including a worked example of a UGF calculation are set out in 
Appendix 1 of the Local Plan. 
Biodiversity 
Policy OS3: Biodiversity 
Development should aim to secure net gains for biodiversity where possible by 
incorporating measures to enhance biodiversity, including: 
• Retention and enhancement of habitats within Sites of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINCs), including the River Thames; 
• Measures rec ommended in the City of London Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) 
in relation to particular species or habitats; 
• Green roofs and walls, gardens and terraces, soft landscaping and trees; 
• Green corridors and biodiversity links; 
162  
 
     
      
   
  
    
  
 
       
 
     
   
  
     
       
   
      
   
      
  
  
   
      
  
 
   
  
   
   
  
 
  
 
  • Wildlife-friendly features, such as nesting or roosting boxes; 
• A planting mix and variation in vegetation types to encourage biodiversity; 
• Planting which will be resilient to a range of climate conditions, with a high 
proportion of native plants; 
• A lighting scheme designed to minimise impacts on biodiversity. 
Reason for the policy 
6.6.23. Protecting and improving biodiversity involves enhancing wildlife populations 
and their habitats. This has positive impacts for the environment, the economic and 
social life of the City and the aesthetics of the streetscape. Healthy biodiversity 
should be viewed as a sign of a healthy environment and healthy city. 
6.6.24. The City has 13 Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs), including 
three new SINCs (Postman’s Park, Portsoken Street Garden, St Dunstan in the 
East Church Garden) which were agreed following a review in 2016. Two existing 
SINCs were agreed to be upgraded as part of this review: Barbican and St Alphage 
Garden , which includes the Barbican Wildlife Garden and the Beech Gardens , was 
upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1 Site of Borough Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SBINC) ; and Roman Wall, Noble Street , which was extended 
southwards to include St Anne and St Agn es Churchyard and was upgraded from a 
Local SINC to a Grade 2 SBINC. These new and upgraded SINCs will formally 
take effect upon adoption of this Plan. 
6.6.25. A number of areas along the riverside, west of Farringdon Street and east of 
Bishopsgate have been identified as areas of deficiency in access to nature by the 
GLA. It is important that opportunities are taken to improve biodiversity throughout 
the City, and particularly in areas where this would improve green corridors or 
biodiversity links, such as along the riverside. The River Thames, which is a Site of 
Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation (SMINC), brings wider benefits 
for migrating birds and fish species. 
How the policy works 
6.6.26. Measures to enhance biodiversity should provide habitats that benefit the City’s 
target species (house sparrows, peregrine falcons, swifts, black redstarts, bats, 
bumblebees and stag beetles) and by extension a wider range of insects and birds. 
The City of London BAP provides further details about the target species and their

6.6.27. New developments should seek to protect and enhance biodiversity and the 
City’s environmental assets. This can be achieved by providing spaces fo r 
biodiversity to flourish through the retention and planting of trees and soft 
landscaping, along with green roofs and walls where possible. A variety of these 
provisions in one development will create habitats for a range of different wildlife 
species. J oined up green spaces and corridors give species a better chance of 
survival in the urban landscape and greater resilience to future climate change. 
These measures will assist in the delivery of the All London Green Grid (ALGG) to 
promote the design and de livery of green infrastructure across London . 
6.6.28. The City’s wildlife depends not only on greenery but also on the built 
environment. Buildings can provide roosting sites for bats and nesting opportunities 
for birds. Artificial features such as nest boxes shou ld be integrated into the design 
of development or refurbishment schemes wherever suitable to provide additional 
habitat for the City’s target species . 
6.6.29. Proposals for riverside developments should consider whether there may be 
opportunities to incorporate h abitat creation measures to enhance the biodiversity 
of the River Thames SMINC. 
6.6.30. Wher e development has a potential impact on designated sites of importance for 
biodiversity, the developer should submit an ecological statement outlining how any 
164  
 
   
 
  
  
   
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
    
    
  
  
   
   
  
      
 
 
  
  
   
  
 
  
 
   
   
    
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 impacts will be avoided, minimised or mitigated . Where necessary, the City 
Corporation will seek independent review of an assessment , paid for by the 
developer. 
6.6.31. Biodiversity net gain is an approach to development that leaves biodiversity in a 
better state than before. This means that where biodiversity is lost as a result of a 
development, the compensation provided should be of an overall greater 
biodiversity value than that which is lost. The Mayor of London will be producing 
guidance to set out how biodiversit y net gain applies in London . 
Trees 
Policy OS4: Trees 
The City Corporation will seek to increase the number of trees and their overall canopy 
cover by : 
• Requiring the retention of existing mature and semi -mature trees and 
encouraging additional tree planting to be integrated into the design and layout 
of developments and public realm improvements where appropriate; 
• Protecting trees which are subject to Tree Preservation Orders (TPO) and 
designating new TPOs where necessary to protect trees of high ame nity value ; 
• Other than in exceptional circumstances, only permitting the removal of 
existing trees which are dead, dying or dangerous. Where trees are removed, 
requiring their replacement with trees that can attain an equivalent value; 
• Ensuring that existi ng trees located on or adjacent to development sites are 
considered during the planning process and are protected from damage during 
construction works; and 
• Promoting tree planting to provide a diverse range of tree species, including 
large -canopy trees wh erever practicable. 
Reason for the policy 
6.6.32. There are just over 2,500 trees in the City, which are found in a variety of 
locations: along streets, in open spaces such as churchyards and livery company 
gardens, residential estates, business premises, historic parks and gardens and 
along the riverside . 
6.6.33. Trees are an integral part of the City’s unique history and an important asset. It 
is essential that the existing tree stock is managed and preserved effectively and 
that new trees are planted having regard to their contribution to enhancing amenity 
and townscape . Trees provide a wide range of benefits in the urban environment, 
includ ing the trapping of air pollutants, enhancing biodiversity, providing shade and 
shelter from sun and rain, absorbing rainwater and filtering noise. 
6.6.34. The City of London Tree St rategy SPD aims to increase the number of City 
Corporation owned trees and ensure that all trees within the City are managed, 
165  
 
  
     
    
   
   
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
   
   
   
    
 
   
    
   preserved and planted in accordance with sound arboricultural practices whilst 
taking account of their contribution to amenity and the townscape for both current 
and future generations. The Tree Stra tegy SPD will be kept under review and 
should be read alongside the City of London Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) . 
6.6.35. Trees play an important role in connecting green spaces to create green 
corridors. Additional planting where feasible will help to reinforce those corridors. It 
is important that new tree planting includes a variety of species to increase the 
resilience of the City’s tree stock against the threat of disease and the impacts of a 
changing climate. 
How the policy works 
6.6.36. Developers will be expected to safeguard existing trees , plant new trees and 
only remove trees in exceptional circumstance s. Where trees are removed during 
development works , replacement trees of an appropriate species, height and 
canopy cover must be planted when works are completed . The City Corporation 
will seek financial compensation for any trees removed or damaged without 
permission. This value will be based on a recognised tree valuation method such 
as the Capital Asset Value for Amenity Trees (CAVAT) or i -Tree Eco . 
6.6.37. The City Corporation will use TPOs, s106 planning obligations or conditions to 
ensure the retention of existing trees and the provision of new trees.

 6.7. Climate Resilience and Floo d Risk 
Context 
6.7.1. This section aims to ensure that the City of London remains resilient to changing 
climate patterns. The main focus is on flood risk and the risk of overheating of 
buildings and spaces which will become more frequent as a result of climate 
change. 
6.7.2. The UK Climate Projections (CP 18) predict that London will experience a rise in 
mean temperatures of between 2oc and 6oc by 2061 . This will increase the risk of 
overheating and the need for energy intensive air conditioning. In addition to this 
the City can experience temperatures up to 100c higher than the countryside 
around London, due to heat retention and waste heat expulsion from buildings 
resulting in an Urban Heat Island Effect. Climate change could potentially affect 
patterns of win d flow in high -density urban environments like the City and this will 
be kept under review. The City Corporation has adopted a Climate Action Strategy 
setting out how the City can transition to a zero carbon economy by 2040 and be 
resilient to the impacts of climate change. 
Strategic Policy S 15: Climate Resilience and Flood Risk 
Buildings and the public realm must be designed to be adaptable to future climate 
conditions and resilient to more frequent extreme weather events. 
• Development must minimise the risk of overheating and any adverse 
contribution to the urban heat island effect; 
• Development must avoid placing people or essential infrastructure at 
increased risk from river, surface water, sewer or groundwater flooding; 
• Flood defence struc tures must be safeguarded and enhanced to maintain 
protection from sea level rise. 
Reason for the policy 
6.7.3. Today’s new buildings will probably be in place for decades or longer and must 
be resilient to the weather patterns and climate conditions they will en counter 
during their lifetime. Designing climate resilience into buildings and the public realm 
will help keep the City safe and comfortable as climate patterns change. Policy 
DE1 (Sustainability standards) sets out standards for new development in the City 
and the City Corporation ’s ambition to move to a zero emission City by 2040 . This 
includes scope 3 emissions and embodied carbon which can be addressed through 
whole life carbon assessment. 
6.7.4. Although the total annual rainfall is projected to remain bro adly similar to current 
levels, patterns of rainfall are expected to change with more intense storms and 
periods of low rainfall. This will increase the risk of flooding, particularly from 
surface water and from sewer surcharge from London’s combined drain age 
network. Conversely there will be a greater risk of water shortages and drought 
conditions as rainfall fluctuates. 
167  
 
   
 
      
   
  
   
     
  
  
 
  
 
      
 
    
 
  
  
 
     
    
  
  
   
      
  
    
     
 
    
  
     
   
    
 
  
   
    
 
 
 
 
 
 6.7.5. The City lies within the tidal section of the Thames and is vulnerable to sea level 
rise resulting from climate change. The Thames Estua ry 2100 Plan identifies the 
need for the existing flood defences in central London to be raised by up to 0.5m 
by 2065 and 1m between 2065 and 2100 to protect London from flooding. 
How the policy works 
6.7.6. The City Corporation will continue to monitor and mode l climate change impacts 
on the City to inform policy and decision making through implementation of, and 
annual monitoring and review of, the City Corporation’s Climate Action Strategy. 
UK Climate Projections and the detailed actions in the Climate Action Strategy will 
form the basis of future planning for climate resilience in the City. The City of 
London Strategic Flood Risk Assessment will be reviewed at least every five years 
or more frequently if circumstances require. 
6.7.7. Developers will be required to demonstrate that their proposals have taken 
account of predicted climate change and will minimise the impacts of changed 
climate patterns on future occupants and the City’s communities. 
Policy CR1: Overheating and Urban Hea t Island Effect 
1. Developers will be required to demonstrate that their developments have been 
designed to reduce the risk of overheating through: 
• solar shading to prevent solar gain, particularly on glazed facades; 
• urban greening to improve evaporative cool ing; 
• passive ventilation and heat recovery; 
• use of thermal mass to moderate temperature fluctuations; 
• minimal reliance on energy intensive cooling systems. 
2. Building designs should minimise any contribution to the urban heat island effect. 
Reason for the policy 
6.7.8. Development presents an opportunity to renew or adapt the existing building 
stock and public spaces , or provide new buildings and spaces , which will cope 
better with changing climate patterns. The design of buildings should reduce 
energy demands from cooling infrastructure, making them more resilient to higher 
temperatures. Measures such as urban greening and design features that provide 
shade and shelter can have a positive impact on or near the building, minimising 
the urban heat island effect (see Policy OS2) . 
6.7.9. Climate adaptation measures can contribute to wider benefits by pre -empting 
potential detrimental climate impacts. Careful selecti on of plants which are resilient 
to a range of weather conditions will assist wildlife to survive changed climate 
conditions. Urban greening and reduced reliance on air conditioning will have 
benefits for the City’s air quality.

 How the policy works 
6.7.10. For al l major development, the City Corporation will require climate adaptation 
and resilience to be addressed at the design stage. Sustainability Statements 
should include details of the proposed adaptation and resilience measures. Energy 
statements should demonstrate how energy demand for cooling will be minimised . 
BREEAM credits for adaptation to climate change should be targeted. 
6.7.11. For minor development, the Design and Access Statement should include 
details of climate resilience and adaptation measures . 
Policy CR2: Flood Risk 
All development within the City Floo d Risk Area , and major development elsewhere, 
must be accompanied by a site -specific flood risk assessment demonstrating that: 
• the site is suitable for the intended use, in accordance with the Sequential and 
Exception tests (see table s 4 and 5) and with Environment Agency and Lead 
Local Flood Authority advice; 
• the development will be safe for occupants and visitors and will not 
compromise the safety of other premises or increase the risk of flooding 
elsewhere; 
• safe access and egress routes are identified; and 
• flood resistance and resilience have been designed into the proposal. 
Reason for the policy 
6.7.12. While the City is generally at low risk of flooding due to its topography, some 
parts of the City are at risk of flooding from the River Thames and from surface 
water/sewer overflow in the former Fleet valley. 
6.7.13. Figure 25 identifies the areas at risk from t hese sources as the City Flood Risk 
Area. This policy will ensure that vulnerable uses are not located in areas that are 
at risk of flooding and that suitable flood resilience and evacuation measures are 
incorporated into the design.

Figure 25: City Flood Risk Area 
How the policy works 
6.7.14. Site-specific flood risk assessments must address the risk of flooding from all 
sources and take account of the City of London Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 
and the City of London Local Flood Risk Management Stra tegy. Necessary 
mitigation measures must be designed into and integrated with the development . 
Design and m itigation measures such as sustainable drainage systems may 
provide protection from flooding for properties beyond the site boundaries. 
6.7.15. Within the C ity Flood Risk Area different uses will be acceptable in different 
zones. Table 4 shows the vulnerability classifications and Table 5 shows which 
level of vulnerability classification is suitable in which part of the City Flood Risk 
Area. The Environment A gency’s flood zones are shown on the Policies Map. The 
Sequential Test must be applied for all development other than minor development 
or change of use in the City Flood Risk Area , which comprises Environment 
Agency Flood Zones 2 and 3 and areas at risk of surface water / sewer flooding . 
Where a change of use results in a more vulnerable use evidence must be 
presented to demonstrate safety and suitable access and egress routes . Where 
necessary, conditions may be attached to planning permissions to manage the 
change of use into more vulnerable categories.

 Essential • Essential transport infrastructure (including mass evacuation 
routes) which has to cross the area at ris k. 
Infrastructure • Essential utility infrastructure which has to be located in a 
flood risk area for operational reasons, including electricity 
generating power stations and grid and primary substations 
Highly Vulnerable • Police and ambulance stations; fire stations and command 
centres; telecommunications installations required to be 
operational during flooding. 
• Emergency dispersal points. 
• Basement dwellings. 
• Installations requiring hazardous substances consent. 
More Vulnerable • Hospitals 
• Residential institut ions such as care homes and hostels. 
• Buildings used for dwelling houses, student halls of 
residence, drinking establishments, nightclubs and hotels. 
• Non-residential uses for health services, nurseries and 
educational establishments. 
• Sites used for waste ma nagement facilities for hazardous 
waste. 
Less Vulnerable • Buildings used for shops; financial, professional and other 
services; restaurants, cafes and hot food takeaways; offices; 
general industry, storage and distribution; non -residential 
institutions not included in ‘more vulnerable’ and assembly 
and leisure. 
• Police, ambulance and fire stations which are not required to 
be operational during flooding. 
• Waste treatment (except hazardous waste facilities). 
Water -compatible 
development • Flood control infrastructure. 
• Sewage transmission infrastructure and pumping stations 
• Docks, marinas and wharves. 
• Navigation facilities. 
• Water -based recreation (excluding sleeping 
accommodation). 
• Amenity open space, nature conservation and biodiversity, 
outdoor sports and recreation and essential facilities such as 
changing rooms. 
Table 4: Flood risk vulnerability classifications relevant to the City 
Source: Relevant uses from Planning Practice Guidance – Flood Risk and Coastal Change 
6.7.16. If the intended use of a site falls into one of the categories where an Exception 
Test is required , as set out in Table 5, the developer will need to investigate 
whether there is a reasonably available site outside the City Flood Risk Area which 
would be more s uitable for the intended use. If no alternative site is available, the 
developer must demonstrate through the Exception Test that the benefits of the 
development outweigh any risk from flooding, and that the development will be safe 
without increasing the risk of flooding elsewhere.

Table 5: Suitability of different uses in flood zones 
Source: amended from Planning Practice Guidance – Flood Risk and Coastal Change 
6.7.17. The City of London Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) provides guidance 
on suitable flood resistance measures to prevent water entering the building and 
flood resilie nce measures, which enable speedy recovery in the event of flooding. 
These measures should be specified for all development within the City Flood Risk 
Area and may be controlled by condition . Passive design measures such as 
suitable threshold levels and th e use of flood resilient materials will be favoured 
over active measures such as removable flood barriers. All sleeping 
accommodation must be located above the modelled t idal breach level as shown in 
the SFRA unless it can be demonstrated that a permanent fixed barrier at the 
threshold of the property would prevent water ingress in a breach event. 
172  
 
      
   
  
   
  
      
   
  
   
  
 
     
 
      
  
 
   
    
 
  
  
 
     
   
 
 
 
   
  
  
   
   
    
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 6.7.18. Design measures can help to reduce flooding, thus protecting the local area 
beyond the development site through: 
• sustainable drainage systems; 
• green/blue roofs; and 
• rainwater reuse, recycling and attenuation 
6.7.19. Resistance to flooding can be achieved through design measures such as: 
• raised kerbs and altered topography which contains water at a distance from 
the building; 
• avoiding opening windows or vents at ground floor or basement levels; 
• using low permeability materials to limit water penetration of external walls, and 
flood resistant doors to prevent water ingress; and 
• fitting non -return valves on plumbing to prevent sewer surcharge within the 
building. 
6.7.20. Flood resilience measures make clean up after a flood more efficient, and 
include: 
• avoiding locating sensitive equipment such as computer servers at lower levels 
of buildings in flood prone areas; 
• locating all fittings, fixtures and services at a suitable height to minimise 
damage by flood waters; 
• using impermeable surfaces and structures; and 
• providing sumps and soak -aways that gradually release water to the sewer 
network. 
6.7.21. In order to demonstrate that the development will be safe for occupants, flood 
warning and evacuation plans should be provided for all ‘more’ or ‘highly’ 
vulnerable development within the City Flood Risk Area. Details of the type of 
measures which should be included in an evacuation plan are set out in the City’s 
SFRA. 
6.7.22. For mi nor development outside the City Flood Risk Area, an appropriate flood 
risk statement should be included in the Design and Access Statement. 
Policy CR3: Sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) 
1. All development, transportation and public realm proposals must inc orporate SuDS 
principles and be designed to minimise the volume and discharge rate of rainwater 
run-off into the combined drainage network in the City, ensuring that rainwater is 
managed as close as possible to the development. 
2. The design of the surface wa ter drainage system should be integrated into the design 
of proposed buildings and landscaping, unless there are exceptional circumstances 
which make this impractical. Proposals should demonstrate that run -off rates are as 
173  
 
    
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
   
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
   
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
   
 
    
     
        
   
     close as possible to greenfield rates and the number of discharge points has been 
minimised. 
3. SuDS designs must take account of the City’s archaeological and other heritage 
assets , complex underground utilities, transport infrastructure and other underground 
structures, incorporating suit able SuDS elements for the City’s high density urban 
situation. 
4. SuDS should be designed, where possible, to maximise contributions to water 
resource efficiency, water quality, biodiversity enhancement and the provision of 
multifunctional open spaces. 
5. An operation and maintenance plan will be required to ensure that the SuDS 
elements will remain viable for the lifetime of the building. 
Reason for the policy 
6.7.23. The drainage system in Central London comprises a combined network where 
foul sewage from internal plumbing combines with rainwater drainage in the same 
underground pipework. Consequently, heavy rain can result in overloading of the 
drainage network with d ischarges of diluted sewage from manholes within the City 
Flood Risk Area and combined sewer outflow pipes into the Thames at Walbrook 
Wharf and Blackfriars. 
6.7.24. More frequent extreme rainfall events are predicted because of climate change 
and therefore the risk of sewer overflow flooding is increasing. To combat this, it is 
necessary to reduce the total amount of rainwater entering the drains and/or slow 
down the rate at which it enters the drains. Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) 
provide a range of techn iques for achieving this. 
How the policy works 
6.7.25. All development presents opportunities to reduce rainwater run -off. The 
cumulative impact of minor development, transport and public realm proposals are 
as important as major development in reducing the risk o f sewer overflow flooding. 
Therefore, all development, transport and public realm proposals must contribute to 
a reduction in rainwater run -off to the drainage network. 
6.7.26. For major development, pre -application discussion with the City Corporation as 
Planning Authority and Lead Local Flood Authority and consultation with the 
Environment Agency, Thames Water and other interested parties is encouraged to 
ensure that SuDS designs are suitable for the proposed site. SuDS designs must 
comply with the London Plan Dr ainage Hierarchy and local requirements should be 
discussed at pre application stage with the City Corporation . 
6.7.27. Although planning permission may not be required for all transport and public 
realm schemes , SuDS and drainage plan s should be integrated into t he design 
process of these schemes to protect the City from flooding. 
6.7.28. For all major development, a separate SuDS and Drainage Plan must be 
submitted at application stage. For minor development the Design & Access 
174  
 
  
  
   
   
   
 
  
 
    
     
  
  
  
 
    
    
 
  
  
   
 
   
  
    
  
 
    
 
   
     
   
  
   
   
  
  Statement should include details of how rai nwater run -off has been minimised. 
Designs should focus on reducing flows as close as possible to greenfield runoff 
rates , minimising the number of discharge points from the site. 
6.7.29. Proposals should demonstrate an integrated approach to water management, 
for example intercepting the first 5mm of each rainfall event through greening and 
incorporating rainwater storage for reuse or irrigation. Major developments should 
specifically maximise the other benefits of SuDS such as biodiversity, amenity and 
water qual ity. 
6.7.30. Arrangements for maintenance throughout the life of the building must be 
considered in the design of SuDS . Planning conditions may be used to secure a 
suitable operations and maintenance plan. 
Policy CR4: Flood protection and flood defences 
1. Development must protect the integrity and effectiveness of structures intended to 
minimise flood risk and, where appropriate, enhance their effectiveness. 
2. Wherever practicable, development should contribute to an overall reduction in flood 
risk within and beyond the site boundaries, incorporating flood alleviation measures 
for the public realm. 
Reason for the policy 
6.7.31. The City of London is protected from flooding by the Thames Barrier, and more 
locally by flood defence walls along the River Thames. The Tham es Estuary 2100 
(TE2100) project recognises the need for the raising of flood defences by up to 
0.5m by 2065 and 1m by 2100. 
How the policy works 
6.7.32. Development adjacent to the flood defences must maintain their integrity and 
effectiveness for the benefit of the whole City. Development on the riverside should 
be designed to enable future flood defence raising without adverse impacts on river 
views , the setting of historic buildings and pedestrian movement along the riverside 
walk. Constraints may exist where f lood defences form part of an existing building . 
Discussions with the Environment Agency will be required to establish the most 
effective designs for improved flood defences and to incorporat e adequate set back 
from the defences to allow for future maintenance and raising in line with the 
TE2100 Plan. 
6.7.33. A strategic approach to flood defence raising will enable riparian developers to 
design buildings and the riverside environment to accommodate h igher flood walls. 
Riparian owners are responsible for maintenance and enhancement of flood 
defences.

   6.8. Circular Economy and Waste 
Context 
6.8.1. The City Corporation is the Waste Planning Authority (WPA) for the Square Mile, 
with a statutory duty to plan for all the waste that is generated in the City. With no 
waste treatment plants in the City , the City Corporation relies on WPAs elsewhere 
to provide such facilities. By applying circular economy and waste hierarchy 
principles: designing for durability and mod ularity, making better use of under -used 
assets through sharing, reusing products and materials and recycling as much as 
possible , waste can be designed out and embodied carbon retained . This approach 
will reduce waste exports from the City whilst application of the proximity principle 
will ensure that residual waste is processed as close as possible to the City. 
Strategic Policy S 16: Circular Economy and Waste 
1. The City Corporation will support businesses and residents in moving towards a Zero 
Waste City, by applying circular economy principles, the waste hierarchy and the 
proximity principle at all stages of the development cycle. 
2. The City Corporation will actively co -operate with other Waste Planning Authorities in 
planning for capacity to manage the City’s residual waste through: 
• Identifying waste management capacity in the City, or elsewhere in London, to 
meet the City’s London Plan waste apportionment target, including through 
partne rship working with other London Waste Planning Authorities ; 
• Co-operating with Waste Planning Authorities within and beyond London to 
plan for suitable facilities for the City’s waste ; 
• Safeguarding Walbrook Wharf as a waste site and wharf suitable for the r iver 
transport of waste; and 
• Monitoring waste movements to and from the City and reviewing its waste 
arisings and capacity study at least every five years. 
Reason for the policy 
6.8.2. The City Corporation has responsibility to plan for adequate facilities to man age 
the waste that originates in the City. This includes waste collected from the City’s 
households and businesses, waste generated in the process of redevelopment and 
hazardous waste from premises such as St Bartholomew’s Hospital. 
6.8.3. The London Plan and the London Environment Strategy set the framework for 
waste management in London. These strategies promote circular economy 
principles and the waste hierarchy: prevention, preparing for reuse, recycling, other 
recovery, and disposal only as a last resort. 
6.8.4. The current London Plan has set a waste apportionment figure requiring the City 
to identify sites with capacity to manage 100,000 tonnes of waste annually until 
2036. In the draft London Plan, the proposed apportionment for the City is reduced 
to 84,000 tonnes per annum in 2021 and 90,000 tonnes per annum in 2041 . This 
176  
 
   
  
   
    
 
    
 
   
  
   
     
   
  
  
   
    
   
   
  
   
   
   
  
   
      
   
  
    
  
     
  
  
    
 
    
    
    
 
    
  
 
  
 
 figure represents the City’s contribution to meeting the Mayor’s target of 100% net 
self-sufficiency in the management of London’s household and commercial and 
industrial waste from 2026. 
6.8.5. The London Plan sets out criteria for the selection of waste management sites, 
which the City of London Waste Arisings and Waste Management Capacity Study 
review 2016 used to evaluate potential sites in the City. This study concludes 
that, with current technologies and economic considerations, there is no viable 
waste management capacity within the Square Mile and that the City will not be 
able to satisfy the London Plan waste apportionment within its boundaries. 
6.8.6. The City Corporation has an agreement w ith the London Borough of Bexley and 
participates in the South -East London Joint Waste Planning Group, which 
comprises the boroughs of Bexley, Bromley, Greenwich, Lewisham and Southwark 
along with the City of London. The Group has identified sufficient was te 
management capacity up to 2036 to meet the combined apportionment of each of 
its individual members. The City will continue to contribute to London -wide waste 
planning through membership of the London Waste Planning Forum and will work 
with the GLA and the Environment Agency to improve waste planning. 
6.8.7. For commercial reasons, a proportion of the City’s waste will continue to be 
transported to sites outside London. This includes construction, demolition and 
excavation (CD&E) waste which is not covered by the Mayor ’s targets for net self -
sufficiency. Annual monitoring of such waste exports will inform Duty to Co -operate 
discussions with receiving authorities within and outside London to ensure that 
sufficient capacity remains in the planning pipeline. 
6.8.8. The London Plan sets out borough apportionments for land -won aggregates 
which should be reflected in local plans. No apportionment is made for the City of 
London and there is no requirement to include a policy for minerals within the Local 
Plan. Applicatio n of circular economy principles encourage s the re -use and 
recycling of demolition waste and the use of recycled aggregates in order to reduce 
reliance on imported agg regates and retain embodied carbon . 
6.8.9. It is imperative that the City adopts circular econom y and waste hierarchy 
principles, to cut down on the quantity of useable materials that are discarded and 
to eliminate reliance on disposable items, including single use plastics, in the City . 
Those materials that are discarded should be managed as close a s possible to the 
City and transported by modes that are least damaging to the environment. 
How the policy works 
6.8.10. The City Corporation will continue to monitor the quantities and types of waste 
originating in the City and work with the City’s communities to minimise this waste , 
applying circular economy principles to design out waste and pollution and keep 
products and materials in use . The City Corporation will continue to work with the 
South -East London Joint Waste Planning Group and other Waste Planning 
Authorities in London and beyond to ensure that the City’s waste apportionment is 
met and that suitable facilities are available for t he City’s waste to be managed in 
the most sustainable way. 
177  
 
  
   
   
    
   
 
  
  
 
    
 
   
  
 
     
 
     
    
       
   
    
   
  
    
 
  
  
  
     
   
  
   
    
    
   
 
 
  
   
 
    
  
  6.8.11. Changing economics and new waste management technologies means that 
small scale waste management is becoming more viable within the City, 
particularly within large development sites. 
6.8.12. During the p eriod 2018 – 2036 a proportion of the City of London’s waste will 
continue to be managed outside London. Co -operation with waste planning 
authorities outside London will aim to ensure that facilities with sufficient capacity 
remain available to accept the City’s waste during this period. 
6.8.13. The City Corporation will continue to safeguard Walbrook Wharf as a waste site 
and river wharf in line with the London Plan and the Safeguarded Wharves 
Direction. Any proposed development which would prejudice the operatio n of the 
existing safeguarded waste site at Walbrook Wharf will be refused. 
Policy CE1 Zero Waste City 
Development should be designed to promote circular economy principles throughout 
the life cycle of the building through: 
• Flexible building design to acco mmodate evolving working and living patterns , 
reducing the need for redevelopment; 
• Re use and refurbishment of existing buildings, structures and materials to 
reduce reliance on virgin resources and retain em bodied ca rbon; 
• Requiring development to be designed to allow for disassembly, reuse and 
recycling of deconstruction materials ; 
• Requiring the maximum use of recycled materials in development and off -site 
construction methods to reduce wastage ; and 
• Designs which enable durability, modularity, sharin g of goods and services 
and reuse of supplies and equipment, minimising waste during the building’s 
operational phase. 
2. All development proposals should incorporate waste facilities which must be 
integrated into the design of buildings and allow for separat e treatment, storage and 
off-road collection of waste and recyclable materials , where feasible . Major 
developments should provide a single waste collection point to facilitate efficient 
waste management from multi tenanted buildings. 
Reason for the policy 
6.8.14. The circular economy is an alternative to the typical ‘linear’ way of treating 
resources. By finding ways of remanufacturing, reusing or recycling materials and 
keeping them in use for longer , waste can be reduced . The circular economy 
emphasises design fo r durability and modularity, making better use of under -used 
assets through sharing and offering products as a service. Circular economy 
principles can be applied to buildings and the development cycle, reducing the 
demand for new materials, and to the ope rational phase of a building’s life to 
minimise annual waste arisings. 
178  
 
  
    
    
 
  
   
     
 
   
 
   
    
    
   
 
 
  
    
Figur e 26: Circular Economy 
6.8.15. The design of buildings impacts on the potential for implementation of the waste 
hierarchy during their operational stage, through the facilities and waste 
management services that are incorporated into the design. For example, reliance 
on single use coffe e cups and disposable plastics can be reduced by incorporating 
kitchen facilities and water fountains into building designs and waste movements 
can be reduced by managing food waste on -site through composting or anaerobic 
digestion. These facilities must b e considered at the building’s design stage. 
Figure 27: Waste Hierarchy 
6.8.16. Waste prevention is the most desirable action in the waste hierarchy as it results 
in no waste whatsoever.  Re -use is the next most desirable option as it involves 
products and materials being used again for their original intended purpose. 
Recycling is the next most preferable option, involving the collection of used items 
and processing them into raw materials to be remanufactured into usable products 
or materials. The recover y of energy, through techniques such as anaerobic 
digestion, is a way of getting the most out of otherwise useless waste.  Disposal 
should be the absolute last resort, after all the other options have been exhausted. 
179  
 
        
  
 
   
 
   
  
   
      
  
 
     
   
  
  
 
  
   
  
    
 
 
 
  
  
 
   
   
   
  
   
  
     
  
  
  
  
 
 
   
    6.8.17. On major developments opportunities for waste minimisation and on -site waste 
treatment, in line with the London Plan’s definition of waste management, should 
be explored in order to minimise the transport of residual waste within and beyond 
the City. The City of London Waste Arisings and Capaci ty Study identifies a range 
of options which should be considered , subject to the appropriate environmental 
permits, to facilitate a reduction in residual waste from City development sites. 
6.8.18. Waste treatment, storage and collection facilities must be integrated into new 
development and considered at an early stage of design to avoid the problems 
created by the placing of waste on the highway. Adequate provision must be made 
for the volume and types of residual waste and recyclables expected to be 
generated, especially the amount of paper and packaging generated by offices. 
The need to avoid health hazards associated with waste from catering 
establishments, the waste storage and collection needs of street traders, the 
separate storage of recyclable waste and the special arrangements required for the 
storage and transportation of clinical and hazardous waste should be provid ed for , 
where necessary. 
How the policy works 
6.8.19. Pre-application consultation on suitable waste treatment, storage and collection 
facilities is encouraged. The level of detail required at the planning application 
stage will be proportionate to the scale of de velopment. 
6.8.20. The Environmental Statement (for EIA applications) or sustainability statement 
should provide an assessment of on -site waste treatment options and quantities of 
residual waste likely to arise from the site. 
EIA Development 
6.8.21. For development tha t requires an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) the 
Environmental Statement should demonstrate how circular economy principles 
have been incorporated into the development , fully address ing how construction, 
demolition and excavation (CD&E) waste will b e minimised , deconstruction 
materials will be reused or recycled and the waste arisings during the operational 
phase of the development will be minimised and managed. This should include 
consideration of on -site facilities to reduce the need for waste vehicle movements 
such as on -site composting or anaerobic digestion, or waste consolidation. 
6.8.22. A Circular Economy Statement following the London Plan guidance should be 
submitted for all EIA development . 
Other Major development 
6.8.23. For all other Major development proposals, the sustainability statement should 
provide evidence o f the application of circular economy principles and the 
adherence to the waste hierarchy. This could include reuse of existing buildings 
and structures, provision of Site Waste Management Strategies for the construction 
phase and Zero Waste Plans for the operational stage of the development. Major 
development should aim to achieve maximum BREEAM credits for Waste. 
180  
 
       
  
 
  
   
   
    
    
  
      
 
   
     
 
 
   
  
   
 
 
    
  
   
  
    
 
   
     
   
  
    
  
  
    
 
  
  
  
    
 
 
 
 
 
  
  6.8.24. A Circular Economy Statement following the London Plan guidance should be 
submitted for all Major development. 
All other development 
6.8.25. For all oth er development, the Design and Access statement should 
demonstrate how waste minimisation and the circular economy have been 
considered in the design of the development. 
6.8.26. Waste and recyclables should be capable of collection from off -street service 
areas w hich are integrated into the design of buildings. The provision of such 
areas may not be practicable in small developments or refurbishments and may 
conflict with the protection of listed buildings and conservation areas. In such 
cases waste stores withi n the site near the highway are preferable to the 
presentation of waste and recyclables on the pavement.  Residential 
developments , including short -term-lets, must be provided with ground floor waste 
and recyclables storage and collection facilities, with direct access to the highway 
for collection purposes. 
6.8.27. The City Corporation will attach appropriate planning conditions relating to waste 
treatment, storage and collection, but may also make use of its other regulatory 
powers to control waste in the City.  Compliance with the City of London’s 
operational waste requirements should contribute to BREEAM requirements for 
waste credits . 
Policy CE2: Sustainable Waste Transport 
The environmental impact of waste transport will be minimised through: 
• Encouraging the use of rail and waterways for removal of waste, including 
deconstruction waste and delivery of construction materials; 
• Ensuring maximum use of rail and waterways for th e transport of excavation 
waste particularly from major infrastructure projects; 
• Requiring low and zero emissions transport modes for waste movement; 
• Reducing the number of waste vehicles by promoting optimum use of waste 
transport vehicle capacity through on-site or multi -site consolidation of waste. 
Reason for the policy 
6.8.28. The proximity principle advocates that waste should be managed as close as 
possible to where it originates to reduce the environmental impacts of its 
transportation. The City’s restricted land area makes the provision of waste 
facilities within the City problematic and it therefore rel ies on movement of the 
waste that is generated in the City to appropriate waste management facilities 
elsewhere in London and beyond London’s boundaries. 
6.8.29. Unlike other local authority areas, the majority of the waste that is generated in 
the City is managed by private contractors. A proportion of the City’s waste, 
including the small fraction of household waste, is transported by river from the 
181  
 
  
  
   
  
    
  
       
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
   
    
       
 safeguarded wast e transfer station at Walbrook Wharf. The remainder is 
transported primarily by road, with destinations varying from one year to the next 
due to the commercial decisions of private waste contractors. 
6.8.30. This policy aims to maximise the use of the River Thames for waste transport, 
encourage transport modes such as rail and other waterways and encourage 
efficient use of low and zero emissions road vehicles for transporting waste. 
Figure 28: Destinations for the City’s waste 2012 -2018 
How the policy work s 
6.8.31. The City Corporation will continue to work with the Port of London Authority, 
Marine Management Organisation and the Environment Agency to enable 
sustainable use of the River Thames for the movement of freight and waste. 
Major development 
6.8.32. Construction L ogistics Plans should identify how sustainable transport of waste 
materials from the site will be addressed during the construction phase. Delivery 
and servicing plans should demonstrate how the transport of waste will be 
minimised , the potential for use o f the river to move waste , and how low emission 
vehicles will be enabled during the operational phase of the building’s life. 
182  
 
   
  
    
   
 
    
   
 
   
    
  
  
  
  
     
 
  
 
 
   
   
 
  
   
 
   
  
   
    
  
  
  
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 All other development 
6.8.33. Planning application documents should clearly demonstrate how waste 
minimisation, storage and sustainable waste transport have been addressed . 
Policy CE3: New waste management sites 
Proposals for new facilities for waste management, handling and transfer will be 
required to demonstrate through design and sustainability statements that the 
benefits of the proposed development outweigh any adverse impacts and particularly 
that: 
• the development will handle waste which has been generated locally; 
• access arrangements, mode of transport and transport routes will minimise the 
potential for conges tion and environmental impacts, including local air quality 
impacts and carbon emissions. Use of the river for transport of waste and 
recyclables will be encouraged; 
• the carbon impact of the development will be minimised.  New waste facilities 
should com ply with the Mayor’s Carbon Intensity Floor (CIF); and 
• the development is resilien t to natural and man -made safety and security 
challenges. 
2. Noise -sensitive development adjacent to the existing waste site at Walbrook Wharf 
and development which would compro mise the use of the river for waste operations, 
will be resisted 
3. Development in the vicinity of new waste management sites should not compromise 
the waste management operations on the site or create an unacceptable land use 
conflict. 
Reason for the policy 
6.8.34. Although the City is unlikely to be able to accommodate large waste 
management facilities within its boundary, changes in technology and waste 
transport costs may make small scale commercial facilities viable in the future. 
How the policy works 
6.8.35. Assessment of potential conflicts such as noise, vibration, odour, visual impact, 
pedestrian access and road or river transport will be a key matter in consideration 
of proposals. Mitigation which resolves potential conflicts may be necessary for 
developme nt to proceed. 
6.8.36. The criteria set out in this policy will be used, alongside other policy 
considerations, to evaluate the suitability of proposed waste facilities and 
conditions will be applied to ensure that any new facility is suitable for the City’s 
high-density urban environment.

Key Areas of Change 
7.1. Introduction 
7.1.1. This section of the Plan sets out area-based poli cies and proposa ls relating to 
seven ‘Key Areas of Change’ , together with a n overarching policy which applies to 
the whole of the City’s riverside . The Key Areas of Change have been identified as 
they are likely to experience significant change over the Plan period and present 
particular opportunities or challenges that warrant a specific policy focus . 
7.1.2. Identifying Key Areas of Change provide s a policy framework for bringing forward 
beneficial change within those areas , including the delivery of key development 
schemes , improving accessibility and the quality of the public realm, and 
introducing new uses or mixes of uses. The Key Areas of Change also provide a 
strategic context for the development of projects and funding bids by a range of 
City Corporation departments and external partners. 
7.1.3. The Key Areas of Change are shown indicatively on the Key Diagram and on the 
individual diagrams that accompany each area policy. 
7.1.4. Where appropriate, the City Corporation will prepare further guidance to support 
the delivery of the vision for particular Key Areas of Change. This may ta ke the 
form of planning briefs or supplementary planning documents and will be pr oduced 
in partnership with key stakeholders and local land owners .

 7.2. Thames Policy Area 
Context 
7.2.1. The River Thames is an iconic feature of London that forms the southern 
boundary of the City and plays a major role in its prosperity and everyday life. The 
riverside provides a breathing space from the busy environment which 
characterises the rest of the City, as well as a traffic -free walkway on the north 
bank of the Thames. 
7.2.2. The River Thames serves several important functions, including as a corridor for 
freight and pedestrian transport, a tourism and recreational asset, a unique setting 
for views of the City and a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SMIN C). The City’s topography, with the land rising from the riverside, means that 
most of the City is at relatively low risk from flooding. Nevertheless, this risk needs 
to be managed, particularly in the face of climate change. 
7.2.3. The London Plan requires the City’s Local Plan to designate and ensure the 
maintenance of a Thames Policy Area and to take account of emerging Maritime 
Spatial Plans prepared by the Marine Management Organisation. Policy S17 sets 
out the policy considerations which apply to the whole of the City’s riverside, as 
defined on the Policies Map. Further detailed guidance is provided in the City 
Corporation’s Thames Strategy SPD. The City Corporation’s Riverside Walk 
Enhancement Strategy sets out its plans for public realm enhancement along t he 
riverside, which forms part of the Thames Path National Trail. 
7.2.4. The River Thames changes character on its way through the City, as it does 
through London. It includes areas where very limited change is likely to occur, such 
as at The Temples. However, t wo areas, at Blackfriars and the Pool of London, 
have been identified as Key Areas of Change because they are places where 
renewal is desirable and where there is potential for significant redevelopment and 
enhancement of existing buildings and the public realm during the Plan period. 
Policies relating to Blackfriars and the Pool of London follow the overarching policy 
for the Thames Policy Area. 
Strategic Policy S 17: Thames Policy Area 
The unique character of the City’s riverside, and its uses for transpor t and recreation, 
will be enhanced by: 
1. Designating the Thames Policy Area and preparing and keeping under review a 
Thames Strategy SPD, which identifies the attributes of the area and gives guidance 
on development within this area. 
2. Co-operating with neighbouring boroughs to develop a joint Thames Strategy for the 
central section of the River Thames. 
3. Ensuring that buildings and spaces on or near the riverside contribute to sustainable 
economic growth and further the aims of the Riverside Walk Enhanceme nt Strategy, 
particularly through: 
185  
 
      
  
    
  
 
 
  
 
   
 
   
   
   
 
   
 
     
  
  
 
   
    
 
  
  
  
   
  
  
    
 
  
   
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 • protecting and enhancing public access and river views along the riverside 
walk and securing completion of the riverside walk at Queenhithe; 
• improving access to the River Thames by enhancing north -south routes and 
the cr eation of a continuous riverside walk; 
• improving the vibrancy of the riverside by encouraging a mix of commercial 
and cultural uses and promoting office -led commercial development, while 
safeguarding heritage assets and biodiversity value; 
• provision of publicly accessible roof terraces, where they do not impact 
adversely on protected views, the amenity of occupiers or nearby residents; 
and 
• supporting the Illuminated River project to deliver more sustainable bridge 
lighting and engage visitors with the River. 
4. Supporting , and safeguarding land for , the construction of the Thames Tideway 
Tunnel. 
5. Promoting the use of the River Thames and its environs for transport, navigation and 
recreation, particularly through: 
• safeguarding Walbrook Whar f for waste and river related freight traffic, 
including freight consolidation; 
• encouraging the use of the River Thames for the transport of construction and 
deconstruction materials and waste; 
• retaining Blackfriars Pier, and access to Tower Pier, and enco uraging the 
reinstatement of Swan Lane Pier and the use of these facilities for river 
transport. Applications to remove these facilities will be refused unless suitable 
replacement facilities of an equivalent or higher standard are provided; 
• refusing devel opment on or over the River, except for structures which 
specifically require a waterside location for river -related uses; 
• resisting the permanent mooring of vessels; if moored vessels are 
exceptionally permitted they must be of national importance, have a special 
connection with the City and the River Thames, be used for a river -related 
purpose and not have a detrimental impact on navigation or the environment; 
and 
• maintaining and enhancing access points to the River Thames foreshore, from 
both land and wa ter, for public or private use as appropriate, subject to health 
and safety and environmental safeguards. 
6. Ensuring that development does not have an adverse effect on the River Thames 
and Tidal Tributaries Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conserv ation and 
seeking opportunities to create or enhance riverside habitats . 
Reason for the policy 
7.2.5. There are a range of different strategies and plans which affect the Thames 
including: 
186  
 
    
 
   
  
    
 
    
 
   
    
 
    
   
     
   
    
  
 
  
   
   
 
 
     
    
   
 
   
    
  
  
    
  
   
  
  
  
   
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 • The London Plan, which sets out strategic policies for the River Thames and 
requires the designation of a Thames Policy Area. 
• The Mayor of London’s Safeguarded Wharves Review 2018 -19, which aims to 
ensure that London’s need for waterborne freight -handling uses is met . 
• The Thames Estuary 2100 Plan produced by the Environ ment Agency, which 
addresses flood risk and water quality issues. 
• The Thames Vision produced by the Port of London Authority, which sets a 
framework for greater use of the River Thames between now and 2035 
including targets for increased passenger and frei ght movements. 
• Guidance called A Safer Riverside produced by the Port of London Authority, 
which aims to reduce the number of people drowning in the Thames by 
ensuring that safety is an intrinsic part of all development alongside and on the 
tidal Thames. 
• The UK Marine Policy Statement and the emerging South East Marine Plan 
produced by the Marine Management Organisation, which will provide a wider 
strategic context. Until that Plan has been adopted, reference should be made 
to the UK Marine Polic y Statement, which sets out a framework and UK high 
level marine objectives. 
7.2.6. The City of London Thames Policy Area is designated as the part of the City 
where development and change could affect aspects of the river and its 
importance. Collaboration with riparian neighbouring boroughs, the Environment 
Agency, the Marine Management Organisation, the Port of London Authority and 
the Mayor of London is essential to ensure that the strategies and plans for the 
river are realised. 
7.2.7. The London Plan notes that no joint strategy currently exists for the central 
section of the Thames between Chelsea and Tower Bridge, and the City 
Corporation will work actively with neighbouring boroughs to help produce a joint 
Strategy. The City Corporation is undertaking research in to the practical 
implications of raising the City’s flood defences in line with the Thames Estuary 
2100 Plan and is collaborating with neighbouring boroughs to promote shared 
learning and a common approach by all riparian authorities in central London. 
7.2.8. A key infrastructure project is the development of the Thames Tideway Tunnel, 
which is a 25km tunnel running mostly under the tidal section of the River Thames 
through central London. It is intended to capture and divert storm overflows, 
including the Fleet C ombined Sewer Outflow at Blackfriars, to Beckton Sewage 
Treatment Works to avoid discharging them into the river. 
7.2.9. The ‘Illuminated River Project’ is a long -term art installation that involves the 
architectural illumination of bridges across central London . The project will animate 
the river and create further opportunities to develop the riverside walk for the 
enjoyment of visitors and London communities. The scheme commenced in 
summer 2019 and when complete will incorporate 15 bridges in total, of which s ix 
are partly or wholly in the City of London.

 7.3. Blackfriars Key Area of Change 
Context 
7.3.1. The area contains a mix of uses, including offices and commercial uses , the 
City of London School, the Mermaid Events Centre, The Guild Church of St 
Benet Paul’s Wharf, a public car park, Blackfriars Millennium Pier and Blackfriars 
Station. Most development is post -war, with large footprint buildings, few active 
frontages an d a lack of open space. 
7.3.2. It is bounded by major through routes (including Upper Thames Street ) which 
generate pollution and are a barrier to pedestrian movement, separating the 
Riverside Walk from the rest of the City. Access to the Riverside Walk is limit ed 
at street level. Blackfriars Bridge forms an important connection between the 
City and Southwark and Blackfriars Station is a major Underground and Rail 
station. 
7.3.3. There have been improvements along the Riverside Walk at Paul’s Walk and 
the City Corporat ion’s Riverside Walk Enhancement Strategy sets out plans for 
public realm enhancement along the riverside. Development of the Thames 
Tideway Tunnel will create a large new area of public realm built out into the 
river west of Blackfriars Bridge , which is due for completion in 202 5. There are 
significant views of St Paul’s Cathedral and the heights of new buildings are 
limited by strategic and locally protected views. 
Strategic Policy S 18: Blackfriars 
The character and amenities of the Blackfriars Key Area of Change will be enhanced 
by: 
1. Promoting substantial redevelopment or refurbishment of existing post -war 
buildings to provide new high -quality office and commercial accommodation with 
active frontages at ground floor level ; 
2. Implementing the Thames Tideway Tunnel project and creating a high -quality new 
area of public realm at Blackfriars Bridge foreshore ; 
3. Enhancing pedestrian permeability and accessibility, especially through 
improvements to and along the riverside and the pro vision of new and improved 
links across Queen Victoria Street and Upper Thames Street to provide new north -
south routes ; 
4. Encouraging cultural events, arts and play in public spaces , ensuring the retention 
or renewal of existing facilities, where appropriate ; and 
5. Improving the quality of the public realm and identifying opportunities for urban 
greening and pollution reduction measures, particularly along Puddle Dock, Castle 
Baynard Street, White Lion Hill, Upper Thames Street and the churchyard o f The 
Guild Church of St Benet Paul’s Wharf.

 Reason for the policy 
7.3.4. This area contains some post -war development which is underused and does 
not contribute to the context or setting of its location. Except for the area 
adjacent to Blackfriars Station, this part of the City lacks vibrancy and due to the 
road network is notable for a relative lack of pedestrian permeability. Blackfriars 
has been identified as a Key Area of Change to facilitate beneficial commercial 
redevelopment, although this may be a medium or longer -term option due to 
existing leasehold arrangements. 
7.3.5. Baynard House is a large office site and data centre, which includes a public 
car park. It is key to the potential renewal of Blackfriars, since redevelopment of 
this site would provide an oppo rtunity to improve the quality of architecture and 
sense of place, to redesign the road network to reduce the dominance of 
vehicular traffic and to achieve direct pedestrian routes to the riverside. 
7.3.6. Significant redevelopment would provide an opportunity for public realm 
improvements along Puddle Dock, Castle Baynard Street, White Lion Hill and 
Upper Thames Street, to reduce pollution and improve air quality. New active 
frontages will be sought as an integral part of any redevelopment. Pedestrian 
links across Upper Thames Street will be improved wherever possible to link the 
riverside to the rest of the City and to provide easier access to Blackfriars Pier. 
Proposals for redevelopment and the redesign of streets would be required to 
enhance the setting of The Guild Church of St Benet’s Paul’s Wharf and make it 
a more pleasant area to visit and dwell. 
7.3.7. The public realm created by the Thames Tideway Tunnel project at Blackfriars 
Bridge will introduce additi onal greenery to the riverside and will bring more 
activity to the area by providing a new place for relaxation and recreation. This 
facility will include a viewing terrace, civic space, green terraces, and a venue for 
outdoor events and public artwork. Th e riverside walkway will be improved by 
links between the new area of public realm , Blackfriars Bridge and Paul’s Walk 
and enhancements to the pedestrian route between Blackfriars Bridge and 
Millennium Bridge. There is potential to enhance heritage assets and their 
setting by increased pedestrian permeability and there will be new views of 
Blackfriars Bridge and this part of the City from the new area of public realm .

    7.4. Pool of London Key Area of Change 
Context 
7.4.1. The area is the heart of what was once a London’s port which now contains 
predominately office and commercial uses, with some residential and hotel use 
and small -scale retail adjacent to the Tower of London.  Ther e are no tube or 
train stations within the area , but it is well served by public transport just outside 
the area, including London Bridge Station, Tower Hill and Monument 
Underground Stations, Tower Gateway DLR Station and the bus route along 
Eastcheap. River passenger services operate from Tower Pier. 
7.4.2. Lower Thames Street acts as a significant barrier to pedestrian movement to 
and from the rest of the City and air quality is very poor. The opening of London 
Bridge staircase has encouraged more pedestrian mo vement between the 
Riverside Walk and London Bridge . However , there is limited retail or ground 
floor vibrancy and the public realm is uninspiring and does not reflect the 
importance of this area. 
7.4.3. The building stock is a mix of offices, listed buildings, with modern residential 
and hotel development to the east. St Magnus the Martyr Church, All Hallows by 
the Tower Church and Custom House are Grade I listed . Adelaide House and 
Old Billingsgate Market are Grade II listed, while Custom House Quay, cranes 
and stairs are Grade II * listed. Listed buildings and their key features should be 
enhanced. The eastern part of this area is within the local setting of the Tower of 
London World Heritage Site. The height of new buildings is limited by strategic 
and locally protected views. 
7.4.4. Several key buildings are likely to be vacated in the short term, providing an 
opportunity for renewal through development and public realm improvements 
which enhance heritage assets. The aim is to achieve a City riverside whic h 
complements that on the south bank of the Pool of London . 
7.4.5. The riverside walk forms part of the Thames Path National Trail and the River 
Thames is designated as a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature 
Conservation. Minimisation of flood risk and respect for the riverside’s rich 
archaeological and ecological h eritage, are important considerations in this area. 
The area beneath Billingsgate Market and the Billingsgate Bathhouse are 
Scheduled Monuments.

 Strategic Policy S19: Pool of London 
The Pool of London Key Area of Change will be renewed through the refurbishment 
and redevelopment of building stock and the delivery of significant public realm 
improvements: 
1. Enabling office -led mixed commercial use redevelopment or refurbishment, 
including the provision of retail, cultural and leisure uses which are 
complementary to, and do not detract from, the primary business function of the 
City and which enhance heritage assets . 
2. Requiring increased vibrancy and active frontages at ground floor level, through 
the provision of retail and publicly accessible , leisure and cultural uses on the 
river frontage. 
3. Encouraging the provision of cultural events, arts and play in public spaces along 
the riverside , and ensuring their delivery through Cultural Plans . 
4. Preserv ing and enhanc ing the area’s significant heritage assets and historic 
significance including protected views, as well as encouraging more diverse 
communities to appreciate and understand the area through creative 
interpretation . 
5. Improving transport connections and pedestri an links by: 
• improving existing and creating new crossing points and improving 
wayfinding over Lower Thames Street; 
• improving links to the riverside by enhanc ing permeability and connectivity 
between London Bridge, Monument Street and Lower Thames Street; 
• improving signage to and from the Pool of London to the Tower of London; 
• improving the servicing of buildings , encouraging the development of 
shared servicing bays and access points and collaborative management; 
and 
• preventing vehicular access onto the riverside walk and remov ing car 
parking areas upon redevelopment. 
6. Enhancing public realm and public spaces by: 
• enhancing the Riverside Walk to create a continuous publicly accessible 
walkway free of cars between London Bridge and Tower Bridge which is 
accessible to all; 
• identifying opportunities for pollution reduction measures and additional 
greening and planting within the public realm and buildings on 
redevelopment; and 
• seeking additional public space and play facilities.

   Reason for the policy 
7.4.6. The Pool of London provides a visual gateway to the City of London from the 
Thames and is the historic port of London. Several key existing buildings are 
likely to become vacant in the short term and this provides an opportunity to 
enhance and renew the area to provide a high -quality environment for 
businesses, visitors and residents. 
7.4.7. The area is predominantly commercial in character and this will continue 
through encouragement of office -led commercial development. Existing post -war 
buildings could be redeveloped or refurbished to provide high quality office 
space or other commercial activities where these are compatible with the 
business City. Listed buildings and their key features should be enhanced. 
There is potential to provide interpretation of the historic development of the 
area, its relationship with the original site of London Bridge and the significance 
of the riverside. The priority should be for office use, but there is also potential 
for complementary commercial and cultural uses compati ble with the special 
interest of heritage assets and to encourage interpretation and public access to 
historic interiors. 
7.4.8. Publicly accessible r etail, cultural and leisure uses will be encouraged at 
ground floor level throughout the Pool of London to increase vibrancy and 
provide active frontages. 
7.4.9. Redevelopment and refurbishment offer the opportunity to revisit existing 
servicing arrangements . Developers will be encouraged to work with adjoining 
landowners to deliver shared servicing strategies and to minimise movements 
onto Lower Thames Street. 
7.4.10. Despite its significance, the Pool of London is relatively isolated from the rest 
of the City by Lower Thames Street. Working with TfL, the City Corporation will 
seek the improvement of e xisting crossing points across Lower Thames Street 
and the creation of new crossing points to encourage greater movement 
between the riverside and the rest of the City. Where possible, historic routes 
between the river and other areas of the City will be reinstated through the 
redevelopment and refurbishment of buildings. 
7.4.11. The City Corporation will work closely with TfL, landowners and developers to 
design and deliver substantial improvements to the public realm along the 
riverside walk and routes to and along Lower Thames Street. Additional 
greening and open space will be encouraged, with tree planting in appropriate 
locations . Part of the Pool of London lies within the Local Setting Area of the 
Tower of London World Heritage Site. Development proposals and public realm 
works in t his area should seek opportunities to enhance the immediate 
surroundings of the World Heritage Site, as set out in Policy HE3. 
7.4.12. As well as delivering improvements in accessibility, vibrancy and public realm 
at street level, the City Corporation will encoura ge the provision of new, publicly 
accessible roof terraces and viewing areas through building redevelopment or 
refurbishment , whilst safeguarding existing protected views.

    7.5. Aldgate , Tower and Portsoken Key Area of Change 
Context 
7.5.1. The Aldgate , Tower and Portsoken area is positioned in the east of the City the 
southern edge of the area is adjacent to the Tower o f London. 
7.5.2. The area contains a culturally diverse local population and a varied mix of 
uses, including offices, The Aldgate Primary School, Mansell and Middlesex 
Street housing estates, part of Petticoat Lane market and hotels and tourist 
activity associated with the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. There have 
been considerable improvements to the area in recent years, with th e Aldgate 
gyratory being removed, a new square with a café and toilets created and public 
realm improvements implemented. 
7.5.3. Major hotel and office development s are under construction on Minories. 
Proposals for the regeneration of the Mansell Street Estate have been 
considered and several large office sites currently have development potential. 
Petticoat Lane Market, a major tourist draw in the area, is undergoing public 
realm enhancement . These proposals and opportunities will impact on the area. 
7.5.4. The Chinese Embassy could be moving to Royal Mint Court just outside of the 
City boundary and this may lead to further diplomatic and commercial interest in 
this area. The Elizabeth Line stations at Liverpool Street in the City and at 
Whitechapel in Tower Hamlets are both within walking distance of Aldgate . 
Strategic Policy S 20: Aldgate , Tower and Portsoken 
The Aldgate , Tower and Portsoken Key Area of Change will be promoted as a mixed -
use area, which balances the competing needs of residents, workers and visitors, by: 
1. Promoting office -led commercial development to assist in the further renewal of 
the area. Diplomatic use and associated com mercial activity will be encouraged. 
2. Supporting and enabling residential development in appropriate locations and 
identifying and meeting residents’ needs, utilising a range of funding sources to: 
• maximise training, education and employment opportunities f or residents; 
• maximise opportunities for delivering health, community and educational 
services and facilities for residents, particularly in the Aldgate Square area; 
• create additional publicly accessible open and green space and additional 
accessible play space for children; 
• encourage local retail facilities; and 
• facilitate the redevelopment potential of the Mansell Street Estate re -
providing existing social housing , alongside additional residential units, 
reduc ed levels of air and noise po llution, community facilities and good 
quality open and play spaces.

  3. Recognising the benefit and managing the impact of visitors to the area by: 
• enhancing Petticoat Lane Market , celebrating the character and history of 
the area and improving the visitor experience by working in partnership with 
the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, market traders and other 
stakeholders ; 
• encouraging cultural events, arts and play in public spaces ; 
• permitting additional hotel s on appropriate sites; and 
• managing the impact of tourist attractions in the area to minimise 
disturbance to workers and residents . 
4. Improving transport connections and pedestrian connectivity by: 
• implementing improvements to street -level interchange between Fe nchurch 
Street and Tower Hill/Tower Gateway stations, and exploring the feasibility 
of a direct interchange route; 
• improving Aldgate Bus Station to improve air quality and deliver better 
access for pedestrians to and from community facilities, housing esta tes, 
open spaces and retail facilities; 
• sealing the ramp leading to the closed Aldgate Gyratory underpass and 
enhancing the area; 
• encouraging pedestrian routes and permeability through large development 
sites, particularly the Mansell Street Estate and between Minories and 
Mansell Street ; 
• improving signage for visitors from Liverpool Street to Tower Hill and from 
Aldgate to Cheapside and to other tourist attractions as necessary ; 
• enhancing links to the riverside walkway and the Tower of London; and 
• enhancing the north -south walking route between Tower Hill and Aldgate 
along Vine Street. 
5. Enhancing the public realm and open spaces by identifying opportunities for urban 
greening schemes, congestion and pollution reduction measures, particularly in 
the vi cinity of The Aldgate School and Middlesex Street and Mansell Street 
Estates. 
Reason for the policy 
7.5.5. Until relatively recently, Aldgate was not as attractive for business investment 
as other parts of the City due to traffic levels, pollution and a lack of street -level 
activity. The City Corporation and its partners have sought to regenerate Aldgate 
by sti mulating beneficial redevelopment and investing in a programme of 
environmental and public realm enhancements. 
7.5.6. While there have been significant improvements, most notably the removal of 
the Aldgate gyratory and the creation of Aldgate Square , the Aldgate , Tower and 
Portsoken area contains major through routes and parts of the area still suffer 
197  
 
   
  
 
   
  
    
  
  
   
 
 
   
  
  
  
    
      
   
   
 
 
 
      
  
  
     
    
     
 
     
 
    
  
  
   
  
 
  
     
    
  with associated congestion and poor air quality. The townscape around Tower 
Gateway is particularly affected by severance issues because of the road and 
rail networ ks, and there is currently little to entice visitors going to the Tower of 
London to explore this part of the City more widely. Tower Gateway lies within 
the Local Setting Area of the Tower of London World Heritage Site. 
Development proposals and public re alm works in this area should seek 
opportunities to enhance the immediate surroundings of the World Heritage Site, 
as set out in Policy HE3. 
7.5.7. Identifying this area as a Key Area of Change will assist in guiding further 
enhancement of the area during the li fetime of this Plan. There is likely to be 
further commercial development, especially through the refurbishment or 
redevelopment of older buildings. The area will also experience increased 
tourism activity, in line with the continued increase in tourist nu mbers in London 
as a whole. 
7.5.8. Residents living on the Mansell and Middlesex Street Estates have lower levels 
of income, employment and education, skills and training than others in the City. 
The redevelopment potential of the Mansell Street Estate means tha t it could be 
one of the largest residential schemes in the City during the Plan period , which 
provi des an opportunity to deliver additional housing to meet housing needs. 
Redevelopment would require the re -provision of existing social housing at 
equivalent rents and service charge, achieving a good quality residential 
environment at high densities and reducing residential exposure to air and noise 
pollution. 
7.5.9. Development in the Aldgate , Tower and Por tsoken area should enhance its 
appearance and vibrancy and will need to balance the interests of the residents 
who live in the area, particularly regarding air and noise pollution, with the 
increased cultural and commercial activities. With development occ urring , small 
pockets of land may be vacant for long periods. Meanwhile uses for such land, 
including carefully designed green spaces , can help improve local air quality and 
be utilised by the local community, visitors and workers for leisure and s porting 
opportunities. Policies OF3 (Temporary ‘Meanwhile’ Uses) and HL7 (Sport and 
recreation ) support this approach. 
7.5.10. Policy S 20 will be implemented through the determination of planning 
applications, the implementation of City Corporation strategies and public realm 
projects and working in partnership with a wide range of organisations. 
7.5.11. Key partners include the London Borough of T ower Hamlets, which is working 
with the City Corporation to rejuvenate Petticoat Lane Market; TfL, which 
manages Aldgate Bus Station, Aldgate and Tower Hill Underground Stations 
and Tower Gateway DLR Station; Aldgate Connect , a cross -boundary Business 
Improvement District (BID) , which will invest £4 million in projects in the area 
over the period to 2025 ; and Historic Royal Palaces, which manages the Tower 
of London World Heritage Site.

 7.6. City Cluster Key Area of Change 
Context 
7.6.1. The east of the City contains a cluster of tall buildings which form part of a 
distinctive skyline and has the highest density of business activity in the City . It 
contains a concentration of offices in banking and insurance use and 
increasingly a wider range of technology, legal and business services. Protected 
views considerations allow for the construction of tall buildings on appropriate 
sites in the Cluster area. Recognisa ble and iconic tall buildings, including the 
Gherkin and the Leadenhall Building , have been constructed over the past 15 
years and a number of significant tall buildings are under construction. Further 
tall buildings have been permitted but not yet commenc ed. Employment in the 
Cluster could increase from approximately 115,000 today, to over 200,000 once 
all current permissions are built out and occupied. 
7.6.2. While increased remote working means that actual footfall may not rise in 
proportion to projected emplo yment growth , the planned intensification of 
development in a relatively small geographic area is expected to lead to a 
significant increase in footfall on streets that are already crowded at peak times. 
The City Cluster adjoins the Liverpool Street Key Ar ea of Change and the 
opening of the Elizabeth Line will bring increased pedestrian movement into the 
Cluster , with Bishopsgate a key pedestrian route into and through the area . This 
concentration of activity will require new approaches to freight and servicing, 
including the use of physical and virtual consolidation. To assi st delivery of 
transformation al projects in the Cluster , the City Corporation will support the 
work of the Eastern City Cluster Partnership in the process to become a 
Business Impro vement District . 
7.6.3. The Cluster is not only a significant employment and tall buildings location, it 
contains a number of heritage assets, including Leadenhall Market which 
provides a key retail use in the heart of the Cluster and a valuable contrast to the 
modern development that surrounds it. The St Helen’s Place Conservation Area 
contains the churchyards of St Helen and St Ethelburga, providing open space 
and respite for workers. The Cluster also forms the focus of the annual Sculpture 
in the City exhibit ion and attracts visitors to its contemporary and historic 
architecture. 
Strategic Policy S 21: City Cluster 
The City Cluster Key Area of Change will accommodate a significant growth in office 
floorspace and employment, together with complementary land uses, transport, 
public realm and security enhancements, by; 
1. Increasing the provision of world class buildings that are sustainable and offer a 
range of office accommodation to cater for the needs of varied office occupiers ; 
2. Delivering t all buildings on appropriate sites, including on Renewal Opportunity 
Sites. These should make a positive contribution to the City’s skyline, preserving

  heritage assets and settings, taking account of the effect on the London skyline 
and on protected views ; 
3. Protecting the City’s businesses, workers, residents and visitors against crime 
and terrorism by promoting the natural surveillance of streets, open spaces and 
buildings and implementing area -wide security measures, funded in part through 
s106 planning obligations ; 
4. Enhancing the streets, spaces and public realm to improve connectivity into and 
through the Cluster, and prioritising pedestrian movement during the daytime in 
key streets such as St Mary Axe, Leadenhall Street and Lime Street ; 
5. Delivering a high -quality public realm , maintaining the quality of the microclimate 
and increasing urban greening; 
6. Ensuring the provision of high -quality utilities and communications infrastructure 
and efficient use of the subsurface through early engagement and joint working 
between developers and utility providers ; 
7. Introducing new approaches to freight , construction logistics and servicing and 
delivering improvements to public transport to ensure the City Cluster can 
accommodate the planned level of growth ; and 
8. Improving access to retail, leisure, cultural, health and educational facilities and 
services by encouraging a range of complementary land uses, ensuring active 
frontages at ground level and supporting activities such as ‘Sculpture in the C ity’. 
Reason for the policy 
7.6.4. The City Cluster has been identified as the area within the City that is most 
suitable for tall buildings on sites which are less constrained by view protection 
policies than elsewhere . The spatial extent of the Cluster and the Renewal 
Opportunity Sites has been informed by technical work undertaken to develop 
the City’s 3D digital modelling, which shows that there is scope for further tall 
buildings , although not every site within the Cluster will be suitable. Market 
demand for new office space in this area has remained high and a large 
proportion of the office development pipeline is within the City Cluster. The 
resulting increase in floorspace and employment will inevitably put more 
pressure on public transport, streets, open spaces and services. 
7.6.5. Office development within the City Cluster will be expected to deliver flexible 
floorspace to meet the needs of a range of occupiers and ensure the City’s stock 
is resilient and ready to respo nd to changes in the market. While all forms of 
development should be of high -quality design, tall buildings by their nature have 
an impact on the wider London skyline . It is important that they enhance the 
overall appearance of the Cluster on the skyline while also having a successful 
relationship with the space around them at ground level and with particular 
regard to the Tower of London World Heritage Site . The Renewal Opportunity 
Sites have potential to accommodate a n uplift in floorspace in new buildings of 
201  
 
       
   
    
  
    
      
 
 
   
   
   
   
 
  
 
    
  
     
   
  
 
   
    
 
   
  
  
 
 
  an appropriate design and height . The City Corporation will continue to use 3D 
modelling of the Cluster to understand opportunities for redevelopment. 
7.6.6. The intensification of development will have cumulative environmental and 
transport impacts which need to be carefully managed. Individual proposals for 
new tall buildings will need to take account of these cumulative impacts, 
especially the need to maintain and enhance the provision of pavement and 
public open space around the building, to ensure safe and comfortable levels of 
wind, daylight and sunlight, solar glare and solar convergence, and to implement 
efficient servicing and deliveries arrangements. 
7.6.7. The City Corporation is working with businesses and stakeholders to address 
the challenges facing the City Cluster. During the Plan period improvements to 
key streets and spaces will create a better connected and more interesting 
pedestrian experience. Proposals include timed or permanent cl osures of certain 
streets to create a pedestrian priority core, wider pavements and improved 
crossings, which would enable consequential public realm improvements such 
as more greenery and space for cultural and seasonal events. The City 
Corporation’s City Cluster Vision provides further details about these proposals, 
including an indication of potential design proposals. 
7.6.8. Area -wide security measures will be implemented, including the Anti -Terrorism 
Traffic Regulation Order, to reduce the risks associated w ith high -profile 
buildings and increasingly crowded streets. Developers will be required to 
contribute towards the design and implementation of area -wide security through 
s106 planning obligations proportionate to the scale of the development. Area -
wide ap proaches to servicing and deliveries will be promoted, for instance the 
use of physical and/or virtual consolidation measures. 
7.6.9. Active frontages and complementary land uses will be encouraged to enhance 
vibrancy and viability, extending to weekends to dive rsify the City, its economy 
and community.

 7.7. Fleet Street and Ludgate Key Area of Change 
Context 
7.7.1. The Fleet Street area is the former home of the press but has changed in 
character as the newspaper and publishing industries moved away . The western 
extent of the area comprises the legal precincts of the Inner and Middle Temples 
and adjoins the Royal Cou rts of Justice in the City of Westminster. Fleet Street 
is a Principal Shopping Centre (PSC) with retail frontage along its extent, 
although most units are small and cater principally for the lunchtime market. 
The street forms the spine of the Fleet Stree t Conservation Area and has 
numerous listed buildings. 
7.7.2. The St Paul’s Conservation Area extends up much of Ludgate Hill and 
surrounding streets and frames the approach to the Cathedral. Protecting and 
enhancing this heritage and views of St Paul’s Cathedra l will be a key 
consideration guiding future change. Fleet Street , Ludgate Circus and Ludgate 
Hill form part of the ancient processional route between Westminster and the 
City of London , providing iconic views of St Paul’s Cathedral. Fleet Street , 
Ludgate Circus and Ludgate Hill are heavily trafficked, with narrow, often 
congested, footways but there is a strong sense of place resulting from the 
spaces and the architecture. 
7.7.3. Significant occupational change presents an opportunity to promote renewal of 
the area through appropriate development or refurbishment of key buildings and 
to improve links north and south of Fleet Street to Holborn and the River 
Thames. The City Corporation, in partnership with the Ministry of Justice, is 
developing proposals fo r a new court building and police facilities in the area 
which will complement the legal cluster and stimulate further investment in this 
area. 
7.7.4. Junction improvements at Ludgate Circus will deliver a safer pedestrian and 
cycling environment. Recent major development on Ludgate Hill, together with 
new hotel provision, has enhance d the retail offer and the quality of commercial 
and visitor accommodation. 
Strategic Policy S 22: Fleet Street and Ludgate 
The character and function of the Fleet Street and Ludgate Key Area of Change as a 
centre for judicial and related business, a royal and state processional route and a 
Principal Shopping Centre (PSC) will be promoted by: 
Protecting and enhancing the character and appearance of the royal and state 
processional route including views of St. Paul’s Cathedral from the route . 
Developing new court facilities and City of London Police station, having regard to 
the impact of the development on the Fleet Street Conservation Area and heritage 
assets and the need to ensure security of the buildings for court and police use . 
204  
 
    
    
   
    
  
  
     
     
   
  
   
    
   
   
 
 
   
     
    
  
   
   
  
 
 
  
    
 
 
  
    
   
   
   
     
   
   
    
 
 
 
 
  
 
Continuing  to prot ect existing office use in the area, whilst encouraging office -led 
redevelopments with a mix of complementary retail, leisure and cultural uses 
which enhance the area’s rich heritage and culture. 
Providing flexible spaces and complementary uses in appropriate locations. 
Directing further residential developme nt to appropriate sites off principal streets to 
reinforce existing residential cluster s, ensuring a high quality of residential 
amenity. 
Retaining  retail provision within the Fleet Street P SC and Retail Link and 
encouraging extension of retail , leisure a nd cultural activity into the evening and 
weekends, whilst retaining a focus on comparison and convenience shopping in 
the PSC. 
Enhancing  the public realm and open spaces by: 
• improving and increasing the capacity and accessibility of pavements along 
Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill and junction improvements at Ludgate Circus ; 
• enhancing the courts and alleyways that lead off Fleet Street and Ludgate 
Hill and churchyards that are located in the area ; 
• enhancing the immediate setting of S t. Paul’s Cathedral through high quality 
development and public realm enhancements; and 
• delivering additional greening on streets and open spaces and encouraging 
the greening of buildings, where compatible with heritage considerations. 
Reason for the poli cy 
7.7.5. Fleet Street is an iconic location with a name synonymous with the UK 
newspaper and publishing industry. However, the newspapers that occupied 
Fleet Street have moved out to be replaced with commercial office occupiers. 
The area is an established legal cluster, focused on the Temples in the City and 
the Royal Courts of Justice within the City of Westminster. The area is identified 
in the London Plan as a CAZ Legal Cluster . 
7.7.6. The City Corporation in partnership with the Ministry of Justice has proposed a 
new flagship court facility for London to tackle cybercrime, fraud and economic 
crime. The proposed new court and police station will need to be consistent with 
the requirement to protect and enhance heritage assets in the Fleet Street 
Conservation A rea and the protection of retail uses within the Fleet Street PSC, 
whilst addressing the need for security and secure access. 
7.7.7. The Fleet Street area has a strong cultural offer with attractions ranging from 
Dr Johnson’s House to the St Bride’s Institute, the Bridewell Theatre and the 
historic churches of St Brides , St Dunstan’s in the West and Temple Church. 
These attractions help draw visitors to the area, which support the PSC. 
7.7.8. Ludgate Circus is a major junction between Fleet Street, Ludgate Hill and 
Farringdon Street. The western side lies within the Fleet Street PSC, whilst the 
205  
 
    
   
 
    
 
    
  
 
    
   
 
  
     
  
 
 
  
  
   
   
   
   
  
   
     
     
      
  
    
    
   
   
  
     
 
   
     
  
  
   
   
       
   
    
      
 
 eastern side is within an identified Retail Link. Ludgate Hill forms the principal 
approach to St Paul’s Cathedral and a key element of the royal and state 
processional route. Major commercial development at Old Bailey has enhanced 
the office and retail offer on t his street and further hotel development could 
support the City’s growing visitor economy. 
7.7.9. The Key Area of Change contains a mix of large modern office developments 
and smaller scale historic buildings on small plots more suitable for SME use. 
Several majo r occupiers have vacated office buildings on Fleet Street in recent 
years , providing opportunities for beneficial change though the City-wide 
presumption in favour of protecting office uses will continue to apply and the 
area’s commercial office focus will remain . Heritage and views constraints may 
limit opportunities for significant increases in floorspace . 
7.7.10. There may be potential for partnership working between occupiers in the area 
to deliver improvements and more flexible use of some buildings whilst retaining 
a predominance of commercial use s which complement the City’s business 
focus. To assist with the development of a coherent vision for the area, the City 
Corporation will support the work of the Fleet Stree t Quarter Partnership in the 
process to become a Business Improvement District. The Partnership is keen to 
explore ways in which Fleet Street can act as a vibrant spine for the area, while 
improving its links with other parts of the City including the area up to High 
Holborn and access to the riverside. 
7.7.11. The area contains an existing residential cluster to the north of Fleet Street, 
with a number of upper floors of buildings on Fleet Street itself converted to 
residential in recent years. South of Ludgate Hill is the established residential 
area of Carter Lane . Fleet Street , Ludgate Hill and Carter Lane suffer noise from 
commercial and retail activities, while traffic contributes to poor air quality along 
parts of Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill. To ensure a high quality of residential 
amenity, new residential development in this area will be directed to sites away 
from principal streets, so that the potential for noise disturbance and exposure to 
poor air quality can be minimised. 
7.7.12. The PSC is an important aspect of Fleet Street that provides vibrancy along 
its length. To strengthen the PSC, it should continue to focus on comparison and 
convenience shopping , but also look to extend its retail offer into the evenings 
and weekends. The Retail Link on Ludgate Hill provides a key route between the 
Fleet Street and Cheapside PSCs and further development for retail and town 
centre uses is appropriate along this route. 
7.7.13. The key streets within the area offer a poor public realm , being heavily 
trafficked with narrow footways that are congested particularly during peak hours 
and lunch times. There is limited greenery along Fleet Street , Ludgate Circus 
and Ludgate Hill. Additional planting will need to consider the impact on the 
established characte r of the area and on key views of St Paul’s Cathedral along 
the processional route. There is scope to enhance the public realm and achieve 
a better balance between motor vehicles and pedestrians , including through the 
widening of pavements . Improvements to the public realm will deliver benefits to 
the area as well as improve air quality and provide more quiet areas in the 
206  
 
    
 
    
     
     
  
     
    
      
     
         
     
      
  
     
     
   
  
 
 network of courts and alleyways behind Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill . St Bride’s 
Churchyard is one of the largest public spaces in the Fl eet Street area and has 
significant potential for enhancement. Other parts of the area where the public 
realm and street environment offer scope for improvement include Carter Lane 
and the Whitefriars area to the south of Fleetbank House . 
7.7.14. The Key Area of Change extends up to St Paul’s Cathedral, an interna tiona lly 
recognised landmark on the London skyline which is sit ed at one of the highest 
points in the City and was London’s tallest building between the early eighteenth 
century and the 1960s. The local setting of St Paul’s remains relatively low-rise, 
allowing the scale and significance of the building to be appreciated and 
preserving its status as the defining focal point of the processional route and a 
key element of the are a’s character. While the approach to St Paul’s from Fleet 
Street and Ludgate Hill is of historic importance, the setting of the Cathedral and 
the visitor experience is diminished by heavy traffic and associated highway s 
clutter . There is potential for significant townscape enhancements and de -
cluttering along the processional route and for further public realm and 
transportation improvement s in the immediate vicinity of the Cathedral to 
enhance the setting of this iconic building .

  7.8. Smithfield and Barbican Key Area of Change 
Context 
7.8.1. The Smithfield and Barbican Key Area of Change is a vibrant , mixed use area 
that contains: 
• The highest concentration of residential units in the City, including the 
Barbican and Golden Lane estates and Smithfield (principally Barts 
Square); 
• A cultural quarter, known as Culture Mile, focused on the Barbican and 
Museum of London, which is recognised in the London Plan as a strategic 
cultural area; 
• St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, which is a regional hospital and specialist 
cardiac and cancer centre. 
• Smithfield Market, London ’s major wholesale meat market. 
• A mixed office stock and occupier profile , ranging from large corporate 
headquarters to buildings suitable for SMEs , creative enterprises and start-
ups. 
• Many heritage assets of national significance including listed buildings of 
diverse periods, conservation areas, scheduled ancient monuments and 
historic parks, gardens and spaces which enhance its special character . 
7.8.2. This part of the City will undergo significant change and d evelopment over the 
life of the Local Plan with the delivery o f the Culture Mile initiative , includ ing the 
proposed relocation of the Museum of London to Smithfield and the potential 
redevelopment of the site of the existing Museum of London. 
7.8.3. Smithfield Market may move from its current location in this period and 
alternative uses would then need to be found for the historic market buildings. 
Policy S25 supports the continued presence of Smithfield Market in the area in 
the short to medium term , while providing broad guidance on potential future 
uses if the Market move s during the Plan period. 
7.8.4. The opening of the Elizabeth Line, with a station entrance at Lindsey Street 
and another on Moorgate, will significantly increase public transport provision to 
the area and result in increased pedestrian flows to and from these stations, 
Culture Mile and the rest of the City.

      Strategic Policy S 23: Smithfield and Barbican 
The City Corporation will improve the Smithfield and Barbican area by: 
• implementing the Culture Mile initiative, encouraging culture -led mixed -use 
development and complementary uses and delivering art and cultural 
attractions and public realm improvements through the Culture Mile Look and 
Feel Strategy ; 
• ensuring the retention and improvement of pedestrian permeability and 
connectivity through large sites such as Smithfield Market, Golden Lane and 
Barbican whilst seeking to preser ve privacy, security and noise abatement for 
residents and busines ses; 
• ensuring future alternative uses appropriate to the listed status of the market 
buildings in Smithfield if the existing use s are relocated; 
• supporting and enabling residential development in appropriate locations; 
• identifying and meeting residents’ needs in the north of the City, including the 
protection and enhancement of residential amenity, community facilities and 
open space; 
• making improvements to Beech Street to reduce the volume of vehicle traffic, 
improve air quality and increase amenity and vitality; 
• seeking to minimise pollution levels through traffic management measures and 
increased green infrastructure in the public realm and on buildings; 
• requiring improvements to pedestrian and cycle routes for all within and throug h 
the north of the City ; 
• supporting continued connections to the Citigen district heating and cooling 
network and ensuring that, where feasible, all new development is designed to 
enable connection to the Citigen network ; and 
• enhancing the special character of the area through sensitive change. 
Reason for the policy 
7.8.5. The Smithfield and Barbican area contains a very diverse range of uses, 
including commercial offices, retail, market , cultural, hospital and residential, 
which attract large numbe rs of peop le to the area . During the life o f this Plan, 
the proposed relocation of the Museum of London from London Wall to 
Smithfield would release its current site for potential redevelopment. The City 
Corporation has taken a decision in principle, subject to feasibility and 
consultation, to co-locate its 3 wholesale markets to a new location which could 
release the existing Smithfield Market buildings for alternative use. The Culture 
Mile initiative will see a range of cultural and artistic activities implemented 
throughout the area. Together these changes will attract

 a substantial increase in visitor s to this part of the City and enhance the area’s 
attractiveness for businesses, residents and visitors. The opening of the 
Elizabeth Line, linking to national rail and tube lines, will make this area one of 
the most accessible locations by public transport in the country, helping deliver 
the expected increase in visitors . 
7.8.6. Delivery of t his policy will be supported by implementatio n of public realm 
enhancement and transportation schemes and greater activation of streets, 
providing improved amenity, design and movement, for the benefit of workers, 
residents and visitors . The design of new buildings and spaces should provide 
greater pedestrian permeability, ensuring that the area is able to accommodate 
and manage increased volumes of people and activities. A particular concern in 
this area is the need to improv e air quality to protect the health of the large 
resident population and hospital patients. The City Corporation’s Transport 
Strategy proposes to introduce a local Zero Emission Zone covering Barbican 
and Golden Lane by 2022 . An interim 2 -way Zero Emission Street is be ing 
implemented at Beech Street in 2020 under an Experimental Traffic Order . 
7.8.7. The Citigen plant located immediately north of the City on Charterhouse Street 
in Islington, is providing heating and cooling to buildings within the City. Subject 
to future progress on decarbonisation , Citigen offers the potential of low carbon 
heating and cooling to buildings in this part of the City and new development 
should, where feasible, be d esigned to enable connection to the network . 
Culture Mile 
7.8.8. Culture Mile is a unique collection of arts, cultural and educational 
organisations and creative enterprises in the north of the City which has been 
created through a partnership of the City of Lon don Corporation, the Barbican 
Arts Centre, Guildhall School of Music and Drama, the London Symphony 
Orchestra and the Museum of London. Culture Mile runs from Farringdon to 
Moorgate on the east -west axis and from the Golden Lane estate to south of 
London W all on its north -south axis. The Culture Mile area has been identified 
as a Strategic Cultural Area in the London Plan. 
Strategic Policy S 24: Culture Mile Implementation 
The City Corporation will promote and protect Culture Mile as the City’s main cultural 
centre and world class cultural destination, by encouraging and supporting: 
• the proposed relocation of the Museum of London to Smithfield; 
• the potential redevelopment of the current site of the Museum of London on 
London Wall; 
• shared working with the London Borough of Islington to ensure the change and 
development around Culture Mile benefits local communities through improved 
access to and experience of cultural enrichment, education, skills and 
employment opportunities; 
211  
 
    
 
 
     
 
      
   
  
   
    
     
 
        
  
    
  
  
 
    
   
  
    
    
   
    
  
 
 
    
   
  
    
 
  
   
  
  
    • provision of cultural facilities and uses within buildings and the public realm, 
where appropriate, and where the amenity of surrounding uses is not 
significantly compromised; 
• supporting the provision of additional hotel uses in appropriate locations , where 
they are complementary to the City’s business role ; 
• encouraging a diverse leisure, retail, food and beverage offer, particularly along 
the Culture Spine key route ; 
• encoura ging the provision of spaces and premises suitable for start -ups, digital 
and creative industries , and cultural organisations and artists ; 
• strengthening of routes, way finding, lighting and signage throughout the area 
and the links with the rest of the City in a co -ordinated manner; 
• public realm improvements to address increased pedestrian flows and visitor 
numbers to, from and within Culture Mile and to provide a relevant identity for 
Culture Mile ; and 
• safeguarding cultural uses such as churches and m useums . 
Reason for the policy 
7.8.9. Culture Mile has been identified to guide cultural and creative activity within 
this part of the City, including potential development in the area during the life of 
the Plan. It recognises and promote s the City’s cultural attractions to a wider 
audience. The opening of Elizabeth Line stations will stimulate further change in 
the area. 
7.8.10. An important element of the emerging proposals for Culture Mile is the 
identification of movement spines, including a k ey east-west route from the 
proposed Museum of London site, along Long Lane and Beech Street. 
Significant improvements to the public realm and traffic reduction measures, 
particularly along Beech Street, will be progressed to support increased 
pedestrian f lows and the provision of cultural activity on street. Public realm 
improvements will be sought as development opportunities arise. Expansion of 
the area’s cultural offer, including within established institutions, will require the 
provision of appropriate transport infrastructure into and through the area . 
7.8.11. To deliver its ambitions for Culture Mile, the City Corporation is aiming to 
create a distinctive look and feel for the area, which allows for the provision of 
art installations and activity in the publi c realm and addresses the requirements 
for advertising and event promotion. Further planning guidance will be provided . 
7.8.12. The City Corporation and partners have published research that highlights the 
contribution made by creative industries in and around Cu lture Mile to the City’s 
economy and the potential for growth of this sector as part of the Culture Mile 
initiative. The research identified the significant social and economic value that 
212  
 
       
  
   
 
   
 
   
  
 
  
    
      
   
   
  
  
     
 
         
  
    
  
 
   
   
  
     
 
   
  
   
   
   
    
 
       
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 can be derived from the growth of creative enterprises and made four key 
recommendations which are addressed in part through this policy: 
• Create a strong sense of place; 
• Secure the area’s distinctive ecology , including encouraging investment in 
the creative sector, developing new creative workspaces and protecting an d 
encouraging formal and informal performance space; 
• Attract talent, create new jobs and support social mobility; and 
• Drive inward investment. 
Policy SB1: Culture Mile Impacts 
The City Corporation will protect the amenity of residents , worke rs and occupiers and 
conserve and enhance the character of designated and non -designated heritage 
assets by: 
• considering the impact of noise -generating uses, particularly night -time activities 
on residents and business occupiers when granting planning permissions; 
• requiring the installation of noise mitigation measures in developments and 
spaces to minimise the potential for disruption and anti -social behaviour where 
appropriate; 
• managing the highway network to minimise traffic disturbance and to maintain 
access to existing premises for essential servicing ; 
• requiring development and cultural activities to preserve and enhance historic 
buildings and their settings , historic structures and spaces and conservation 
areas; 
• allowing suitable architectural lighting of buildings and spaces, consistent with 
their architectural , cultural and heritage status, the amenity of occupiers and the 
requirements of Culture Mile; and 
• ensuring public realm and open space improvements, and temporary and pop -
up stalls and events do not impede the efficient flow of people and essent ial 
vehicles or detrimentally impact on the conservation area . 
Reason for the policy 
7.8.13. Culture Mile will be a vibrant place with large numbers of people and 
significant activity during the day and into the evening . This level of activity will 
impact on residents and workers as well as the movement of people and traffic 
and therefore a range of mitigation measures need to be considered alongside 
project implementation. 
7.8.14. The London B orough of Islington has designated the Clerkenwell and 
Farringdon area as a Cultural Quarter , where development of cultural and 
213  
 
   
     
   
     
  
  
    
     
   
   
      
    
  
  
 
    
  
   
    
    
     
   
    
   
      
   
  
 
  
  
  
  
   
 
    
  
     
      
 
 
 creative uses should be focused . It also proposes introducing a new Local 
Shopping Area extending from Farringdon Station to Smithfield Market along 
Cowcross Street , which will support development of retail and food, drink and 
entertainment uses . While t hese initiatives will complement the Culture Mile , 
cross-boundary impacts may arise from cultural and night-time economy uses 
on either side of the boundary between the City an d Islington. Proposals for 
such uses in Culture Mile will be expected to mitigate any cross -boundary 
impacts as well as any impacts on City residents and businesses . 
7.8.15. Polic y S9 (Vehicular Transport and Servicing) address es disturbance fro m 
vehicle movements as well as disruption to servi cing arrangements . Policies 
HL3 (Noise and Light Pollution) and CV4 (Evening and Night -Time Economy) 
outline measures to help protect residents from noise and light disturbance and 
the night -time economy . Further guidance is provided in the City Corporation’s 
Noise Strategy, Lighting Strategy and Statement of Licen cing Policy . 
Smithfield 
7.8.16. The Smithfield area has over centuries developed a distinctive mixed -use 
character and townscape and contains the designated Smithfield Conservation 
Area and numerous important listed buildings . It is characterised by the 
wholesale Smithfield Market, the Gener al Market and St Bartholomew’s 
Hospital complex . The hospital is a leading internationally renowned teaching 
hospital and centre for excellence which includes specialist cardiac and heart 
centres. The Smithfield area also supports a range of other land uses, including 
residential, office s, retail, leisure , churches and night -time entertainment. The 
City Corporation has taken a decision in principle to co -locate its three 
wholesale markets on a single site and it is possibl e that Smithfield Market will 
relocate to this new wholesale market site during the Plan period. Smithfield is 
home to a significant number of cultural organisations and creative enterprises 
with links to Camden and Islington . 
Strategic Policy S 25: Smithfield 
The City Corporation will protect and enhance the distinctive mixed -use and historic 
character of Smithfield by: 
• supporting the continued presence of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital; 
• supporting the continued presence of Smithfield Market in the shor t to medium 
term; 
• encouraging the future sensitive re -use of the Smithfield Market buildings, 
should the market relocate , requiring a world class design solution which 
delivers a mix of uses appropriate to its sensitive heritage character; 
• supporting the proposed relocation of the Museum of London to Smithfield; 
214  
 
     
  
   
        
   
   
   
   
     
   
    
   
  
      
 
  
  
  
   
 
 
    
 
    
    
    
  
  
  
     
   
    
     
  
     
 
 
 
 • further enhancing the distinctive character of the Smithfield area by retaining 
existing buildings, and encouraging appropriate new development, suitable for 
accommodating a mix of uses; 
• managing the particular challenges which result from the late evening , 7 day a 
week character of the area; 
• ensuring new activities and developments contribute to a reduction in freight 
and vehicular movements , whilst not adversely impacting the operation of 
businesses and amenity of residents ; and 
• providing for, and supporting, improved pedestrian permeability and the creation 
of new and enhanced public realm across the area to accommodate cultural 
activity and increased pedestrian flows arising from the Elizabeth Line and 
potential new uses in the existing market buildings . 
Reason for the policy 
7.8.17. The proposed relocation of the Museum of London to Smithfield, the opening 
of the Elizabeth Line and development of Culture Mile activities, will result in a 
significant increase in pedestrian and visitor numbers which will place further 
pressure on the public realm. Improvements to the public realm will be required 
to ensure that increased movement can be accommodated. At the same time, it 
is important that new activities do not adversely affect the amenity of existing 
business and residents, the continued operation o f St Bartholomew’s Hospital 
or impact on the area’s historic significance and mixed -use character. 
7.8.18. The City Corporation has carried out a strategic review of its 3 wholesale 
markets, Smithfield, Billingsgate and New Spitalfields. A decision has been 
taken in principle, subject to feasibility and consultation, to co-locate the 
wholesale markets on a single site. As a result, it is possible that Smithfield 
Market may move from its current location in the City at some time in the latter 
part of the Plan period. The Local Plan therefore continue s to protect the 
operation of the Market in Smithfield , but also provide s guidance requiring 
future potential uses of the market buildings to maintain the historic charac ter of 
the existing Grade II* and Grade II listed market buildings. Future uses should 
ensure the legacy of these buildings through world class design and innovation 
which supports the growing evening and weekend economy , complements the 
City Corporation’s aspirations for Culture Mile and is fully inclusive whilst 
protecting local amenity . If the decision in principle to co -locate the wholesale 
markets on a new site is confirmed, then a planning brief or Masterplan 
Supplementary Planning Document will be prepared setting out further 
guidance on potential future uses for th e Smithfield Market buildings.

 7.9. Liverpool Street Key Area of Change 
Context 
7.9.1. The Liverpool Street area stretches from the City boundary with Shoreditch in 
the north east, to Finsbury Circus in the west and the City Cluster to the south. It 
provides a key route from Liverpool Street Station to the B arbican and Culture 
Mile. It is an area that will experience extensive change with the opening of the 
Elizabeth Line and the completion of significant new office floorspace and retail 
and leisure facilities which are currently under construction or progres sing 
through the planning process. 
7.9.2. Liverpool Street is the gateway to the City for East Anglia – as well as being a 
multi -line tube station. The Elizabeth Line will provide fast, easy access from the 
west including from the West End, Heathrow and beyond, linked to Moorgate 
station which already serves stations to the north of London. The increase in 
passengers and pedestrians in this area facilitated by the Elizabeth Line brings 
challenges and opportunities: challenges in terms of additional people on 
already heavily used streets; opportunities in terms of increased accessibility for 
businesses and greater demand for the growing retail and leisure sector. 
7.9.3. The area is a gateway to ‘Tech City’ focussed on Old Street, Shoreditch and 
Spitalfields, and there a re further opportunities to develop tech -related activity in 
the City and its fringes. Facilitating office space suitable for such businesses -
affordable, collaborative, and available for short periods -will enhance the local 
office eco-system and streng then the City’s reputation as a centre for incubators, 
start-ups and the tech and Fintech sectors . Links could be further developed 
between the creativity of the Culture Mile and Tech City, enhancing the creative 
eco-system. 
Strategic Policy S26: Liverpoo l Street 
The City Corporation will enhance the Moorgate -Liverpool Street area to take 
advantage of the opportunities presented by good public transport accessibility, the 
opening of the Elizabeth Line, and restoration of Finsbury Circus and the 
redevelopment and re furbishment of Broadgate by: 
• accommodating the increased footfall by maintaining and enhancing walking 
routes within, to and from the area, including routes to the City Cluster, and 
improving wayfinding; 
• providing active frontages and clear signposting that reflects the area’s 
position as a gateway to the Culture Mile; 
• encouraging the development of flexible and collaborative office space to meet 
the needs of potential start -ups, business growth and the development of the 
tech and fintech ec o-system;

 • facilitating linkages between business, the creative sector and educational 
institutions; 
• supporting additional retail provision in the Moorgate/Liverpool Street Principal 
Shopping Centre and encouraging the extension of retail and leisure acti vities 
into the evenings and weekends, while managing the potential impacts 
associated with the night -time economy; 
• enhancing the public realm and walking routes to Petticoat Lane Market, 
working in partnership with the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and the 
links to Whitecross Street and Spitalfields markets; 
• delivering a high -quality public realm with additional publicly accessible open 
space and increased greenery; 
• supporting improvements to the accessibility and capacity of Liverpool Street 
Station , including enhancing step free access and improving entry points; and 
• improving the safety and capacity of pedestrian routes around Moorgate and 
Liverpool Street Elizabeth Line stations, and between the stations and key 
destinations, including Culture Mi le, Tech City and the City Cluster. 
Reason for the policy 
7.9.4. The Liverpool Street area is undergoing significant transformation through 
redevelopment and refurbishment of Broadgate , provision of more retail 
floorspace and improvements in surrounding streets, the opening of the 
Elizabeth Line and significant intensification in the City Cluster to the south. 
These changes are bringing greater footfall, greater vibrancy and activity se ven 
days a week, enhancing the desirability of the area as a business, retail and 
leisure destination. The Moorgate/Liverpool Street Principal Shopping Centre 
has potential to accommodate significant growth of retail provision during the 
Plan period. Broad gate is currently developing a more ‘outward looking’ 
character and this is expected to continue, alongside further improvements to 
permeability. 
7.9.5. Where suitable funding is available, the City Corporation will support such 
change through delivery of world c lass public realm and improvement to streets 
and pedestrian routes , including additional pedestrian priority and new 
pedestrian routes to maximise permeability , where appropriate . The Transport 
Strategy indicates that the area around Moorgate and Liverpool Street stations 
will be prioritised for improvements, together with the routes between these 
stations and key destinations such as Culture Mile and the City Cluster. Where 
feasible, additional urban greening and the creation of green urban spaces will 
be encouraged. 
7.9.6. The City Corporation will work with relevant partners such as TfL, Network Rail 
and train operators to promote improvements to the accessibility and facilities of 
Liverpool Street Station . This may include enhancing step free access , 
218  
 
     
  
    
   
  
   
   
   improving entry points and reviewing bus interchange , together with any 
potential future improvements to operational capacity at the station . 
7.9.7. Alongside these changes, encouragement will be given to the provision of 
space suita ble for incubators, start-ups, technology -based companies and 
creative industries, including the provision of flexible accommodation suitable for 
these sectors and growing businesses. This will reinforce established links 
between the area and the Old Stree t/Shoreditch/Spitalfields ‘Tech City’ and will 
exploit the opportunities presented by Culture Mile to enhance the creative 
ecology of this part of the City. Collaboration will be encouraged between 
creative industries in Culture Mile and emerging tech industries.

Implementation 
8.1. Planning Contributions 
Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) 
8.1.1. The 2008 Planning Act and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 
(as amended) set out the legislative and regulatory basis for the CIL. They 
provide for the setting and collection of a statutory charge levied on 
development, intended to address the infrastructure needs arising out of the 
implementation of the Local Plan. CI L is the primary mechanism for seeking 
contributions from developers towards the provision of new infrastructure. 
Infrastructure is defined broadly in the Act to include transport, flood defences, 
schools and other educational facilities, medical facilitie s, sporting and 
recreational facilities and open spaces. 
Planning Obligations 
8.1.2. CIL Regulations indicate that planning obligations may only constitute a reason 
for granting permission if the planning obligation is: 
• necessary to make the development accepta ble in planning terms; 
• directly related to the development; and 
• fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development. 
8.1.3. Planning obligations are legal agreements linked to planning permissions that 
regulate the way a development is undertake n, and they are used where it is not 
possible to regulate the permission by means of a condition. They may be in the 
form of in -kind benefits or a financial contribution and may be used to prescribe 
the nature of a development, compensate for loss or damag e created by a 
development, or mitigate the impacts associated with the development. The 
level of any obligation is subject to consideration of its impact on the viability of 
the development proposed. 
Strategic Policy S27: Planning Contributions 
The City Corporation will seek appropriate contributions from developers to manage 
and mitigate the impact of development: 
1. Requiring contributions through the Community Infrastructure Levy to : 
• assist in the delivery of the infrastructure necessary to sup port 
implementation of the Local Plan and the City’s Transport Strategy ; and 
• contribute towards the costs of Crossrail, or other strategic infrastructure, in 
accordance with the provisions of the Mayor of London Community 
Infrastructure Levy 2. 
221  
 
    
  
   
   
   
   
   
     
 
     
 
  
    
 
  
 
   
  
   
  
     
 
    
   
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
    
    
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
  2. Requiring s106 planning obligations, having regard to the impact of the obligation 
on the viability of development, for: 
• site specific mitigation meeting statutory tests; 
• affordable housing; 
• training, skills and job brokerage; 
• carbon offsetting; 
• local procurement in the City and neighbouring boroughs ; and 
• measures to enhance area -wide security, where appropriate. 
3. Use of the Vacant Building Credit is not considered to be appropriate in the City 
of London . 
Reason for the policy 
8.1.4. The compact nature of the City and the intensification of development and 
employment place demands on the City’s services, infrastructure and 
environment. The City Corporation utilises the Community Infrastructure Levy 
(CIL)  to help local infrastructure keep pace with the demands of development 
and attaches planning conditions and negotiates planning obligations (also 
known as S106 agreements) with developers, to ensure proposals are 
acceptable. 
How the policy works 
8.1.5. The City Corporation has adopted a CIL Charging Schedule and will prepare 
an Infrastructure Funding Statement setting out the types of infrastructure or 
infrastructure projects that may be funded in part or in whole by CIL. 
8.1.6. In line with legislative and regulatory requirements, and the provisions of the 
City Corporati on’s CIL, planning obligations in the City will be sought for site 
specific mitigation, including contributions towards area -wide security measures 
in the City Cluster, in line with the policies set out in this Plan. Planning 
obligations will also be negot iated to deliver affordable housing, the provision of 
training and skills programmes and carbon offsetting. Specific requirements are 
set out in other policies within this Plan, particularly Policies S1, S3 and DE1. 
Planning obligations in the City are sou ght principally from commercial 
development, but other forms of development will also be expected to make 
contributions, where appropriate. Affordable housing will be required on -site on 
qualifying residential developments, but exceptionally financial cont ributions will 
be sought. Financial contributions towards affordable housing will be sought 
from commercial development. 
8.1.7. Where required, the City Corporation will seek, via s106 planning obligations, 
Section 278 Agreements with developers to ensure that highway works 
necessary to make a development acceptable are funded by the developer and 
implemented by the highway authori ty. 
222  
 
   
 
  
 
 
   
   
 
 
   
    
 
  
  
  
 
    
    
  
 
 
    
  
   
  
   
   
  
  
 
    
    
   
    
  
   
  
   
 8.1.8. Further detail on planning obligations is set out in the Planning Obligations 
Supplementary Planning Document and in the s106 Standard Template which is 
published on the City Corporation’s website. 
8.1.9. The Vacant Building Credit is set out in national pl anning policy and is intended 
to provide an incentive to bring forward brownfield sites for development. The 
high cost of land in the City of London, together with high levels of demand for 
commercial and residential development, mean that additional incen tives are not 
required to encourage brownfield sites to come forward for development. The 
use of Vacant Building Credit is therefore not considered to be appropriate within 
the City of London. 
Crossrail 
8.1.10. The Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy 2 (CIL2) was 
implemented from 1 April 2019. It requires development across London to make 
a contribution towards the funding of Crossrail 1 and Crossrail 2. The Mayor’s 
CIL2 sets a charging rate for all dev elopment in London, with a higher charging 
rate for office, retail and hotel development in Central London, including in the 
City of London. The Mayor’s CIL2 is payable in addition to the City of London 
CIL. 
Policy PC1: Viability Assessments 
1. Development pr oposals must take full account of the policy requirements set out 
in this Plan and the London Plan, including financial and other requirements 
under the Mayoral and City of London Community Infrastructure Levy and s106 
planning obligations. 
2. Exceptionally, even where policy requirements have been taken into account, 
applicants may consider that these requirements cannot be delivered in full 
without adversely affecting the overall viability of a development . In these 
circumstances, proposals must be supporte d by a scheme specific viability 
assessment. 
3. The viability assessment must be prepared in accordance with the standard 
methodology set out in national planning practice guidance. The price paid for a 
site and/or building will not be a relevant justification for not meeting 
Development Plan requirements. 
4. Viability assessments will be made available on the Planning Register reflecting 
the expectation that these should be publicly available. If the applicant considers 
that the assessment in part o r whole should be redacted for reasons of 
confidentiality, there will be an opportunity for the applicant to make the case. If 
an assessment is redacted, an executive summary will be made public. 
5. The City Corporation will seek independent verification of s ubmitted viability 
assessments , with the cost of verification being met by the applicant. 
6. Where it is agreed that a development cannot viably deliver all required planning 
obligations at the date of permission, but that there are nevertheless other policy 
223  
 
  
     
  
    
   
   
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
    
 
  
   
   
  
    
   
  
    
 
    
    
   
 
  
     
   
 
  
  
   
 
    
 
 
 
     
 considerations which justify the approval of planning permission, the City 
Corporation will normally require a review of the viability information at a later 
stage of the development, or upon occupation. 
Reason for the policy 
8.1.11. Delivery of the Local Plan and the London Plan requires developers to make 
contributions towards infrastructure and affordable housing provision through the 
CIL and s106 planning obligations. Developers must take into account the full 
cost of meeting development plan requirements w hen purchasing sites or 
buildings and in the design of schemes . A whole plan viability assessment has 
been undertaken in the preparation of this Plan demonstrating that as at March 
2020 implementation of the policies should not adversely impact on the viab ility 
of development in the City of London . Exceptionally, there may be 
circumstances where a developer considers that meeting development plan 
requirements in full cannot be delivered without adversely impacting on the 
viability of a development. In such circumstances, the City Corporation will 
require a site-specific viability assessment to be submitted in support of the 
proposed lower level of contributions. 
How the policy works 
8.1.12. Where viability assessments are submitted in support of planning 
applications, these must be prepared in accordance with the Government’s 
recommended approach to viability assessments set out in national Planning 
Practice Guidance. In particular, assessments must demonstrate that the values 
assumed for sites and/or buildings fully reflect the planning policy requirements 
set out in the Local Plan and the London Plan. The actual price paid for land will 
not be a relevant justification for failing to meet the policies in the development 
plan. 
8.1.13. The City Corporation will review viability assessments against the 
requirements in the Local Plan and London Plan and, where necessary, will 
seek independent verification of submitted assessments from suitably qualified 
consultants who have experien ce of the development market in central London. 
Verification of viability assessments will consider whether appropriate costs , 
values and risk rates have been utilised which reflect the ambitions of this Plan. 
The City Corporation will expect the applicant to meet the full cost of this 
independent verification. 
8.1.14. The City Corporation will make all viability assessments submitted, together 
with any verification reports, available publicly via the Planning Register on the 
City Corporation’s website. If a develo per considers that the viability assessment 
should remain confidential in whole or in part, they should provide justification to 
the City Corporation outlining the potential harm that could occur from making 
the relevant information public. The City Corpor ation will consider whether the 
public interest in maintaining confidentiality outweighs the public interest in 
making the viability assessment public. Where the City Corporation considers 
that an assessment should remain confidential in whole, or in part, it will keep

  the justification under review, including taking account of whether information 
should remain confidential with the passage of time from initial submission. 
8.1.15. Where the City Corporation agrees that a development cannot meet the full 
policy requ irements for CIL and s106 planning obligations at the date of 
commencement, but that there are other policy considerations which would 
nevertheless justify approval of the scheme despite this non -compliance, the 
Corporation will normally require that a rev iew mechanism be included within 
any s106 planning obligation, with a review of the viability information required at 
a later stage in the development, or upon occupation. In determining the 
appropriate mechanism, the City Corporation will have regard to n ational 
Planning Practice Guidance , the London Plan and the Mayor of London’s 
Affordable Housing and Viability Supplementary Planning Guidance. Where a 
development is proposed to be undertaken in phases, the City Corporation will 
normally require a review of the viability prior to the commencement of each 
phase of the development. 
8.1.16. Policy S3 Housing requires the use of upwards only review mechanisms in 
circumstances where the affordable housing targets in that policy are not met. 
8.2. Monitoring 
8.2.1. The Local Plan was prepared in the context of the most up to date information 
available. A range of projections and potential future scenarios were considered 
for each policy area. However, circumstances may change and m onitoring of 
Local Plan policies is essential to determine the extent to which the policies are 
delivering the Local Plan vision, strategic objectives and spatial strategy. 
8.2.2. The City Corporation will prepare and publish at least annually a range of Local 
Plan monitoring reports, which measure and evaluate progress towards meeting 
the Plan objectives across a range of policy areas. Policies monitored will 
include offices ; housing; hotels; tall buildings; protected views; sustainability; 
waste; open spaces and green infrastructure . The City Corporation will also 
periodically (Annually) review progress against the programme of infrastructure 
delivery set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. 
8.2.3. The City Corporation is requi red to review the Local Plan at least every five 
years from the date of adoption to determine whether it needs to be updated . 
Data and trends identified in the Local Plan monitoring reports may indicate the 
need for an earlier partial or full review of the adopted Plan. The emergence of 
new trends resulting from the Covid -19 pandemic and its aftermath will be 
regularly monitored for their policy implications. 
8.2.4. As mentioned in the introduction to this Plan, the Government is pursuing a 
planning reform agenda which includes proposals to radically change the format 
and content of local plans. These reforms, if enacted, will be a key factor in 
determining the timing and scope of the next review of the City of London’s 
Local Plan.

     Appendix 1-Technical note on 
applying the Urban Greening Factor 
The diagram and table show a theoretical square development site (100sq.m) 
showing how it would be analysed in terms of surface cover and areas of each type. 
Figure 1: Diagram of simplifie d theoretical development site 
To calculate a UGF score for any proposed development it is necessary to measure 
the overall area of the site and then to map and measure the coverage of various 
surface types within the site. Scores are then assigned to each surface cover and a 
calculation of the overall green space factor can begin. The score for each surface 
cover within a site is multiplied by its area. The formula is shown below. 
(Score A x Area) + (Score B x Area) + (Score C x Area) + (Sc ore D x Area) etc. 
Total Site Area 
227  
 
  
   
   
  
   
          
   
  The relevant scores for each type of surface cover in the City of London is set out in

system to encourage certain categories of greening which will deliver significant 
benefits in the City , particularly tree planting, good quality green roofs (of adequate 
soil depth) and green walls.

 Glossary 
Explanation of terms used in the City of London Local Plan. 
* Terms explained elsewhere in the glossary are marked with an asterisk. 
Accelerator office space 
An office location which provides mentorship, advice, and re sources to help start -ups 
succeed and grow rapidly, normally let on a short -term basis. 
Affordable housing 
Affordable housing is defined primarily by affordability and not by tenure. It comprises 
‘social rented housing’, ‘affordable rented housing’ and ‘intermediate housing’, 
provided to eligible households whose needs are not met by the market. Social 
rented housing is at rents no greater than target rents set by government for local 
authority, Registered Social Landlords* (RSL) and cooperative tenants. Affordable 
rented housing has the same characteristics as social housing but is offered at up to 
80% of local market rentals (including service charges, where applicable). 
Intermediate housing is housing for sale and rent where costs are above target ren ts 
for social rented housing but are at least 20% below local market levels and are 
affordable by households on moderate incomes. Intermediate housing can include 
shared equity (shared ownership and equity loans), starter homes, discounted market 
sales hou sing and other sub -market rented and key worker provision. 
Affordable workspace 
Workspace that is provided at rents maintained below the market rate for that space 
for a special social, cultural, or economic development purpose . 
Agent of Change 
The princi ple that the person or organisation responsible for change is responsible for 
managing the impact of th at change. This includes impacts from noise, vibration and 
lighting. For example , a new residential development near an existing cultural use 
would be responsible for ensuring that residents are not disturbed by the activities of 
the cultural use . Similarly , a new cultural use near an existing residential 
development would need to ensure that existing residents are not disturbed . 
Air Quality Im pact Assessment 
An assessment of the impact of a development on the levels of certain pollutants in 
the local area, which could include: a description of baseline conditions and how 
these could change; relevant air quality concerns; the assessment methods to be 
adopted and any requirements around verification of modelling air quality; sensitive 
locations; the basis for assessing impact and determining the significance of an 
impact; construction phase impact; and/or acceptable mitigation measures.

  Air Qualit y Neutral 
Assessment of air quality against benchmarks set by the Mayor of London through 
his Sustainable Design and Construction SPD 2014. Developments that do not 
exceed these benchmarks will be considered to avoid any increase in NOx and PM 
emissions ac ross London as a whole and therefore be ‘air quality neutral’. 
Apart -hotel 
Accommodation for short or medium -term stays that generally provide more 
amenities for daily use (such as a small kitchenette) than standard hotel 
accommodation. They have a recept ion area where customers can access services 
without pre -booking and are available on a nightly basis without a deposit being 
required against damages. 
Biodiverse green roofs 
A biodiverse green roof should include a varied substrate depth , planted and or 
seeded with a wide range of wildflowers (sedums can be added) . A biodiverse green 
roof should have a sufficient depth of between 80 -150mm. 
Biodiversity 
The variety of plants and animals and other living things in a particular area or region. 
It encompasses habitat diversity, species diversity and genetic diversity. Biodiversity 
has value in its own right and has social and economic value for human society. 
Biodiversity Actio n Plan 
The Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) provides a framework to ensure all legislative 
requirements relating to the management of green spaces are taken into 
consideration at all times and both identifies and prioritises actions for biodiversity at 
a loc al level. 
BREEAM assessment 
The Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method 
(BREEAM) is a sustainability assessment method that sets standards for the 
environmental performance of buildings through the design, specification, 
construct ion and operation phases and can be applied to new developments or 
refurbishment schemes. It focuses on sustainable value across range of categories: 
energy; land use and ecology; water; health and wellbeing; pollution; transport; 
materials; waste; managem ent. 
Build to Rent 
Homes built specifically for private renting rather than for sale which meet criteria set 
out in Policy H1 1 Build to Rent in the Publication London Plan, December 2020.

 Business Eco -System 
A network of organisations, including suppliers, distributors, customers, competitors 
and government agencies, involved in the delivery of a specific product or service. 
Business Improvement District 
A defined area in which a levy is charged on all business rate payers in addition to 
the busi ness rates to develop projects that will benefit businesses in the local area. 
Cash in lieu / commuted sums 
Payments of money received from developers instead of the provision of affordable 
residential units in the City of London. The money is pooled and u sed by the City 
Corporation when opportunities to develop affordable housing arise. 
CAZ -Central Activities Zone 
The area defined in the London Plan* where planning policy promotes financial and 
business services, specialist retailing, tourist and cultural uses and activities. The 
City is wholly within the CAZ. 
Changing Places toilets 
These meet the needs of people with profound and multiple learning disabilities, as 
well as people with other physical disabilities such as spinal injuries, muscular 
dystrophy and multiple sclerosis. These toilets provide the right equipment including 
a height adjustable adult -sized changing table, a tracking hoist system, adequate 
space for a disabled person and carer, a peninsular WC with room either side and a 
safe and clean environment including tear off paper to cover the bench, a large waste 
bin and a non -slip floor. 
Circular economy 
An economy which keeps resources in use for as long as possible, extracting the 
maximum value from them whilst in use, then recover ing and regenerating products
