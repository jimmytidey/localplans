 Information about the preferred options consultation 
 
Consultation Information and how to respond 
 The preferred options consultation will run between Monday 24
th October 2022 and   
12 noon on Monday 12th December 2022.  
 We strongly encourage you to respond using the form available on the council’s 
website at https://www.staffordbc.gov.uk/Strategic -P
 lanning- and-Placemaking-
consultations  Please email completed  f orms  to SPPconsultations@staffordbc.gov.uk  
 Alternatively, if you choose to respond by  e-mail or letter, please identify the 
paragraph or policy number to which your comments relate . Responses made by 
letter should be sent to the following address: Strategic  Planning  & Placemaking , 
Stafford Borough Council, Civic Centre, Riverside, Stafford, ST16 3AQ.  
 We will be arranging consultation events at venues across the borough. Check the council’s website and social media channels for details.  
 What are the p referred options? 
 We are consulting upon a full draft plan including proposed site allocations and an 
updated policies map. This  is not our final draft of the plan so there is still an 
opportunity for changes to be made in response to feedback we receive during this  
consultation. We will continue to gather evidence to support the plan.  Changes may 
also be needed to reflect future changes to government policy including  the National 
Planning Policy Framework . 
 We will be consulting on the final version of the plan the council wishes to adopt  
(Regulation 19 of the Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) ( England) 
Regulations 2012 ) in summer 2023.  
 Why does Stafford Borough need a new local plan ? 
 The new Stafford Borough Local Plan will replace the Plan for Stafford Borough 2011- 2031 adopted in June 2014 and Part 2 of the Plan for Stafford Borough 
adopted in January 2017. Under regulation 10A of The Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 (as amended) councils  must review 
their local plans at least once every 5 years from the adoption date to ensure that 
policies remain relevant and effectively address the needs of the local community. The government advises that m ost p lans are likely to require updating in whole or in 
part at least every 5 years.   
 Stafford Borough Council has decided to undertake a full update of  the Plan for 
Stafford Borough.  Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                    Preferred options consultation

 How will the council assess the environmental impacts of the emerging Local 
Plan?  
 
This preferred options draft plan is supported by a Sustainability Appraisal and 
Habitat Regulations Assessment. These are the principal documents which assess the social, economic, environmental and ecological impacts of the draft plan. They 
can be accessed here: https://www.staffordbc.gov.uk/new -lp-2020
 -2040- evidence-
base  
  What is the status of the Plan for Stafford Borough and other planning documents now that the c ouncil is preparing the new p lan? 
 
For the purposes of making decisions on planning applications, the Plan for Stafford 
Borough 2011- 2031 (adopted in June 2014), the Plan for Stafford Borough Part 2 
(adopted in January 2017), and Neighbourhood Plans that have been made, form 
the statutory development plan for the area until the new Local Plan is adopted.  
 How does the n ew Local Plan address strategic cross border issues?   
 Local authorities have a duty to address issues that have cross border implications with neighbouring authorities and key statutory agencies to comply with the Localism Act 2011 and the duty to co- operate. Stafford Borough Council continues to have on-
going engagement with these partners to share evidence and develop planning solutions across a range of topics.  What is the role of Neighbourhood Plans?  
 Local communities can shape the future development of their areas through 
preparing  neighbourhood plans. Neighbourhood plans must be in general conformity 
with the strategic policies in the adopted Local Plan. A number of Neighbourhood Plans have been ‘made’ across Stafford Borough in accordance with the Plan for Stafford Borough 2011 -2031 and as stated earlier form part of the statutory 
development plan for the b orough. Local communities will have the opp ortunity to 
prepare new Neighbourhood Plans after the New Local Plan 2020- 2040 is adopted.

 How to use this plan  
 
The policies of this plan will be used in the determination of planning applications for 
development within Stafford Borough. Read as a whole the policies tell a decision maker how to respond to an application.  Decision makers will also have regard to 
other material considerations (see glossary) including national planning policy and guidance.   
 Planning applications are required to be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise (see the 
glossary for definitions of the development plan and material considerations) . The 
development plan will comprise of  this plan together with ‘ made ’ neighbourhood 
plans  which are in conformity with the plan,  and the minerals and waste planning 
policies of Staffordshire County Council.  
 The policies of this plan should be read as a whole. Policies are not specifically cross referenced to other policies that may be applicable. Some policies, such as policies 
on design and transport , are likely to be applicable to most planning applications . 
Other policies are focussed on more specific categories of development.  
 We recom mend that those new to the plan:  
 Start with understanding the  development strategy which sets out the strategy 
for the levels and locations of new housing and workplaces that are to be developed in the period 2020- 2040, together with the plan’s response to climate change and the 
types of development that will be deemed acceptable in rural areas.  
 
Look at the policies m ap which shows applicable designations and area- based 
policies.  
 
Review site allocation policies.  These tell you where land is allocated for 
development and set principles and parameters for the form that development 
should take.  
 
Consult the detailed development management policies . Policies 16  and 
onwards are topic -based development management policies. A number of these 
policies are likely to be applicable to most if not all  planning applications. 
 In due course and when considering making a planning application in the light of the policies set out in this plan, you are advised to seek pre -application 
advice from the c ouncil’ s Development  service. We encourage those intending to 
submit a planning application to seek pre- application advice. This process can 
identify the need for specialist input and any issues that may be raised at the planning application stage. It can avoid delay in the planning process. Further details 
of the pre- application advice service can be found on the council’s website:

 Spatial portrait of Stafford Borough 
  
Stafford Borough is centrally located within  the county of  Staffordshire. It lies 
between the north Staffordshire conurbation to the north, comprising of Stoke- on-
Trent and Newcastle- under -Lyme, and the West Midlands conurbation to the south.

 The borough is predominantly rural, covering approximately 230 square miles. It is 
the 238th most densely populated lower tier English local authority, of 317 such 
authorities. It has two main towns, Stafford and Stone and many villages and 
hamlets .  
 
The borough has  excellent transport links, including the M6, West Coast M ainline rail 
and in fut ure will be served by  High Speed 2 (HS2) . Although the borough is 
relatively self -contained, there are important  economic linkages with both the West 
Midlands and north Staffordshire c onurbation s. 
 The population of the borough in 2021  was 136,800 people, with a third  of the 
population living in the borough’s rural areas . Stafford and Stone are the borough’s 
main employment centres.   
 Between 2000 and 2020 the borough’s population is estimated to have grown by 
14%,  which is  above the 13 .1% increase for the West Midlands  region but slightly 
below the 14 .9% increase for England.  
 Stafford Borough has a relatively strong economy. Unemployment rates have been consistently lower than the national average.  Skill levels are relatively high, with 
52.9% of residents having NVQ level 4 qualifications or above compared to 43.1 % of 
the population of Great Britain . The average earnings of borough residents  are 
higher than the West Midlands and England  averages. But the average earnings for 
jobs in the borough are below the averages for the West Midlands and England .  
 Median house prices and affordability ratios in the borough are below national averages, but above those for the West Midlands. The median housing affordability ratio for workplace- based earnings in 2021 was 7. 71, compared to 9. 05 for England 
and 7.50 for the West Midlands.Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                                          Context

The borough is the 230th most deprived lower tier local authority in England, placing 
it in the 30% least deprived local authorities.  
 The natural landscape  of the borough is characterised by flat , low-lying land between 
the rivers Trent, Penk and Sow. Much of the area is intensi vely farmed agricultural 
land (including stock farming), interspersed with ancient and semi -natural woodland 
and grasslands. The upland landscape in the south- east of the borough is nationally 
recognised through it s designation as part of the Cannock Chase  Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty . 
 
The borough contains Ramsar sites (wetlands of international importance  designated 
under The Convention on Wetlands, known as the Ramsar Convention, an 
intergovernmental environmental treaty which came into force in 1975) at Aqualate Mere, Chartley Moss and Cop Mere, 15 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and 4 Special Area of Conservation (SAC) at Cannock Chase, Mottey Meadows, 
Chartley Moss and Pasturefields.  
 There are two areas of Green Belt in the borough. Extensive part s of the  north of  the 
borough lie within the North Staffordshire Green Belt while  part of  the south -eastern 
area of the b orough is designated as part of the West Midlands Green Belt.  50,000100,000150,000200,000250,000

 Key issues and challenges  
 
• Delivering sustainable g rowth: Between 2011 and 2021 the annual growth rate in 
the number of dwellings in the borough was 1% (above the incr ease for England 
of 0.8% and second to Telford & Wrekin Borough as the highest level in 
Staffordshire and Shropshire). Between 2000 and 2018 annual employment 
growth in the borough was +0.83% . More recently , between 2015- 2020, the 
annual employment growth rate was +0.65%, above the England average of 
0.56%. In 2021 Gross Domestic Product per person in the borough was £26,742 
(the 183rd highest among 376 UK local authorities). Therefore, Stafford Borough is 
about average among UK local authorities for the productiveness of its economy , 
although in comparison with other regions in northern Europe it  is relatively weak . 
The borough has  seen above average increases in employment and in 
housebuilding. The challenge for the plan is to support the continued strengthening of the local economy while also continuing to meet housing needs.   
 
• Providing affordable homes: In common with much of England, The Housing and 
Economic Development Needs Assessment highlights the difficulty that many newly forming households in the borough will face in affording market rents 
without the support of housing benefit or in buying a home. Therefore, the provision of  affordable housing is an important  issue to be addressed by the new 
Local Plan. 
 
• Adapting to local demographic change: In line with national trends, the population 
of Stafford borough is ageing. Between 2020 and 2040 the projected number of  
borough residents aged over 64 years of age is expected to increase by 37. 4% to 
43,015 people (2018- based subnational population projections) . Meeting the 
housing needs of the growing older population will be an important  challenge. 
Many of these needs  will be able to be met by  supporting residents to continue 
living in their own homes. This can be achieved by future proofing homes to 
ensure residents can live in them their whole lives, but there will also be a need 
for the continued provision of specialist older persons’ housing, including extra 
care units  to allow for movement between homes.  
 
• Sustaining an attractive and distinctive natural and built environment: The b orough 
has a rich natural environment. This  includes the nationally designated Cannock 
Chase AONB, four Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), three Ramsar sites and 
15 SSSIs . There are also numerous locally designated sites,  ancient and species -
rich hedgerows and ancient woodlands. The borough’s build environment is also 
an important asset and is protected through more than 800 listed buildings and 30 conservation areas.  An important challenge for the new Local Plan will be to 
maintain and enhance the borough’s natural and built environment  whilst also 
delivering development needs  
 
• Ensuring the b orough can reduce its contribution to and respond to climate 
change. The borough council has declared a climate emergency . Climate change Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                                          Context

 is a significant challenge and is likely to have a direct impact in Stafford Borough 
through a greater risk of droughts and  flooding and increased pressure on 
drainage systems, particularly in winter. Action must be taken locally to adapt to 
climate change in  line with the council’s Adap tation Strategy and Climate Change 
and Green Recovery Strategy. Steering new development away from areas prone to flooding, as well as integrating appropriate measures into new development , 
including nature- based solutions to climate change, will reduce the impact of 
climate change . The plan must also reduce lifecycle carbon emissions from new 
development to contribute to minimising further global heating.  
 
• Maximising access to services and reducing the need to travel: Stafford Borough 
is a diverse area with Stafford, Stone and the villages  providing services and 
facilities to an extensive rural hinterland. Supporting and enhancing access to 
services and facilities is important  to achieving sustainable development in the 
borough. The availability of public transport and walking and cycling facilities 
similarly varies across the borough and so the challenge is to locate more significant development in those locations which are or can be made accessible by a range of transport modes. 
 
• Regenerating the b orough’s  towns and villages : The borough’s town and village 
centres face similar  challenges to many centres throughout the country. Changes 
to shopping patterns and competition from online, out -of-town and other regional 
centres mean there is a need for centres to adapt and diversify . An important task 
for the new Local Plan will be to support the  regeneration of Stafford and Stone 
town centres, whilst also enhancing services and facilities in  villages .

1.1 – In the table within the policy ‘Commitments’ means residual site allocations  
under Plan for Stafford Borough and sites with planning permission. 
 1.2 – The Stafford Borough Economic and Housing Development Needs 
Assessment (Lichfields 2020) (EHDNA) outlines that, to supply the workforce to 
support the core employment growth forecast , the borough’s housing need equates 
to 435 new dwellings each year.  This is higher than the minimum figure for local 
housing need set by national guidance ( calculated in accordance with the standard 
methodology outlined in the Planning Practice Guidance) of 391 new homes per year  
(2022) . The higher number of 435 is a therefore a ‘jobs based’ housing projection.  
 1.3 – In addition to the borough’s own housing need, the development strategy also 
allows  for 2,000 homes as a contribution to meeting unmet need of other authorities 
in the region. Those homes are  the subject of  ongoing negotiations with other 
regional authorities . 
 1.4 – It is intended that any  unmet housing need from other authorities  will be 
delivered at Meecebrook Garden Community . This, in turn, is predicated upon 
Meecebrook being able to deliver 3,000 homes within the plan period. If further evidence indicates that Meecebrook would deliver fewer than 3,000 homes within the plan period, then the quantum of unmet needs the borough is able to accommodate would likewise need to be reassessed.  
 1.5 – The development strategy for employment land is based on the EHDNA’s core 
projection for  2020 -2040 employment growth in the b orough plus a 50% uplift to 
align with housing growth that is planned to be above baseline local housing needs .  
 1.6 – As part of the preparation of the Local Plan 2020- 2040 a range of different 
scenarios  for housing and employment growth have been  tested. The selected 
development strategy is ambitious but deliverable. It will deliver more jobs and Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040      Development strategy & climate change

 employment land than the baseline forecast , allowing for a strong bounce- back from 
the COVID -19 pandemic,  and represents an increase in the housing delivery target 
from the Plan for Stafford Borough 2011- 2031.  
 
1.7 – To ensure this plan is positively prepared and maximises delivery to meet 
development needs over the plan period, the plan identifie s or allocates sufficient 
land for approximately 12,580 homes and 150ha of employment land. This provides 
a more than 10% supply buffer above minimum requirements.  
 1.8 – Housing supply over the plan period is summarised  in Table 1  below  as of 31 
March 2022 with subsequent updates to be provided through the c ouncil’s Authority  
Monitoring Report in due course. Appendix 6 provides a trajectory illustrating the 
expected rate of housing delivery over the plan period.  1.9 – In combination existing commitments, windfall, and small site allocations 
through this plan and neighbourhood plans will ensure that 10% of the housing requirement is delivered on small er sites of no larger than 1ha in area.

 1.10 – The spatial strategy for delivery of the development needs reflects the 
settlement hierarchy in Policy 2. In accordance with that spatial strategy, the largest allocations of housing and employment land are focussed on the principal settlements of Stafford and Stone, together with the new Meecebrook Garden Community. Development in the borough’s rural settlements is focussed on those 
settlements with the greatest range of facilities and services . Thereby patterns of 
growth are actively managed to focus significant new housing development on sustainable locations. This coordinates the location of housing with the borough’s main clusters of  economic uses and community facilities and services.  
 1.11 – S tafford and Stone are the borough’s main centres for employment and 
facilities and benefit from the most extensive public transport services. Residents of new homes in these locations will be  likely to need to travel less and will have 
access to a greater range of facilities. Much of the housing to be provided at Stafford is already planned through the north and west strategic development locations.  Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040      Development strategy & climate change

1.12 – As detailed in policies 7 and 8 below, Meecebrook will be a new sustainable 
Garden Community of a scale capable of delivering its own infrastructure. It will contribute significantly to the delivery of housing in the borough in the second part of the plan period and beyond.  
 1.13 – Housing in the borough’s rural communities is allocated in the larger 
settlements (see Policy 2 Settlement hierarchy)  which have more services and 
facilities .  
 1.14 – Economically, the development strategy and supporting policies of this plan 
seek to provide the basis for  support ing sustainable economic growth in both the 
borou gh’s towns and its rural areas .  
 1.15 – The plan supports the following opportunities  and priority  interventions 
highlighted in the Stoke -on-Trent and Staffordshire Local Enterprise Partnership 
Local Industrial Strategy:  
 ●  The opportunity to improve the centre of Stafford to attract professional and 
business services firms, and digital firms, building on current strong connectivity and the future opportunity created by  HS2.  
  ●  The importance of the built and natural environment and the visitor economy.  
 ●  The need to create more flexible small business and grow -on space in key centres 
and in identified employment sites in rural areas.  
 ●  The need to deliver strategic employment sites for inward investment and expansion.  
 1.16 – T he development strategy and policies of this plan:  
 ●  Support business development in Stafford town centre through the allocation of the Stafford Station Gateway site and a flexible approach to land use within the 
centre in Policy 19 ;  
 ●  Protect  the built and natural environment, while supporting development of the 
visitor economy ; 
 ●  Support the creation and expansion of accommodation for small businesses in a range of locations through Policy 18; and 
 ●  Identify the infrastructure needed to support new development, both through specific site allocation policies and through policies on green space, electronic communications and renewable energy.

 1.17 – The Local Industrial Strategy,  The Stoke- on-Trent and Staffordshire LEP 
Strategic Economic Plan and work undertaken by Stafford B orough Council identifies 
the following sectors as being strengths with the potential for growth:  
 
●  High value  advanced manufacturing, for example at Redhill Business Park.  
 ●  The digital sector , with Stafford Borough having nearly 500 digital businesses.  
 ●  The visitor economy with over 4 million annual visits, with a particular focus on attracting more visitors to the town of Stafford.  
 ●  Business and professional services, particularly in central Stafford in proximity to 
the railway station.  
 
●  Agri-tech.  
 ●  The energy sector.  
 1.18 – The plan seeks to recognise and respond to the specific locational 
requirements of these sectors  by encouraging the visitor economy, providing 
employment sites in the right locations, encouraging the renewable energy sector and supporting agricultural development.  
 1.19 – Employment land supply over the plan period includes existing commitments 
as detailed in Table 2  and detailed in Appendi x 7 as at 31 March 2022 with 
subsequent updates to be provided through the council’s Annual  Monitoring Report 
in due course.  Table 2 – S ources of Employment Land Supply

 1.20 – It should be noted that the Stafford Station Gateway allocation replaces the  
existing Plan for Stafford Borough employment allocation at the West of Stafford Strategic Development Location. The employment allocation at Meecebrook is justified based on delivering a mix of uses within the new settlement to achieve a 
more sustainable development . Two further new allocations are proposed under 
Policy 12 in response to market -signals and as insurance against non-
implementation of existing commitments.

 1.21 – T he 5-year review of the plan target will consider the need to adjust the 
development strategy based on  signals from delivery rates, jobs growth and 
economic conditions.  
 
1.22 – The plan period runs until 2040 but in allocating the garden community at 
Meecebrook the council is looking ahead beyond 2040 to continue to meet the borough’s housing needs in the future.

 Spatial strategy for Stafford and Stone  
 
1.24 – Building on the development strategy, the next section outlines in more detail 
the plan’s strategy for the development of the two principal settlements of Stafford and Stone  
 
Stafford settlement strategy  
 Housing  
Stafford town will continue to meet housing requirements by providing approximately 7,385 new market and affordable homes  2020- 2040 .  
 New housing development will be provided at a range of development locations as identified on the policies map – Stafford Town inset, including the following 
strategic development locations:   
• The continued development of the North of Stafford and West of Stafford 
strategic development locations in accordance with Policies 9 and 10;  
• Stafford Station Gateway in accordance with Policy 11  
 Economy  
Employment growth and the promotion of economic diversification will be provided through the completion of existing employment land commitments as detailed in Appendix 7, and by redevelopment within Stafford town centre through: 
 
• The Stafford Station Gateway Project;  
• A new employment allocation north of Redhill under Policy 12; and  
• Town centre regeneration  
 
Land identified as being in an employment use will be protected as employment land in accordance with Policy 16 Protection of Employment Land.  
 Stafford town centre will support Stafford Borough over the plan period as the main service centre. All new development proposals within Stafford town centre should enhance the appeal of the centre and encourage longer visits in accordance with Policy 19 Town Centres and Main Town Centre Uses. A more flexible approach to appropriate uses in the centre would potentially support a more diverse range of activity and encourage the use of vacant units and/or the redevelopment of underutilised buildings.  
 Design and Infrastructure 
Stafford town will continue to be recognised as the central transport hub within the borough. Development will be required to prioritise sustainable transport and, where possible, enhance or provide infrastructure for walking, cycling and public transport, in line with Policy 52.

28                              
↑ Return to contents page  
 Environment  
The historic environment will be preserved and enhanced to help encourage 
tourism within the borough. Stafford town’s unique character and heritage will be promoted. Any residential development will not damage the integrity of the Cannock Chase Special Area of Conservation (SAC), nature conservation interests and Local Nature Reserves. An enhancement area will be delivered within the plan period, as indicated in Policy 14 Penk and Sow Countryside Enhancement Area.  
 
 1.25 – Stafford town is the borough’s principal town and main provider of services, 
facilities, employment and transport links. Reflecting its role as the head of the settlement hierarchy set by Policy 2 Settlement Hierarchy, the strategy for Stafford town will seek to enhance its role by increasing both the range and quality of services and facilities, with all development within the town contributing towards meeting the borough’s growth and development needs.  
 1.26 – The development strategy for Stafford town aims to meet the borough’s 
housing requirements through the continued development of the strategic allocations at the North of Stafford and the West of Stafford in accordance with Policies 9 and 10, and the completion of committed developments as shown in Appendix 6. New development will be sought, including the Stafford Station Gateway project in accordance with Policy 11, and housing site allocations as shown in Policy 12. As well as these site alloca tions, the Local Plan’s detailed policy framework will steer 
the type and quantity of development that will happen within Stafford town.  
 1.27 – Stafford town will maintain its role as the commercial centre of the borough. 
The employment land requirement will be met through redevelopment including the 
Stafford Station Gateway project, and projects such as the town centre 
transformation, to maintain an attractive environment and to ensure an efficient use 
of land. Further employment land will be delivered through the completion of existing employment land commitments as detailed in Appendix 7. Stafford town will continue to support and encourage opportunities for new enterprises and start -up businesses 
and will protect employment land in accordance with Policy 16 Protection of 
Employment Land.  
 
1.28 – Stafford town centre will remain the main service centre of the borough. 
According to the Stafford & Stone Town Centre Capacity Assessment 2019 Stafford town is reasonably healthy, however the proportion of leisure services currently provided is lower than the national average, and there is a high proportion of vacant 
units and floorspace. A more flexible approach will be taken to Stafford town centre’s spaces, including the encouragement of development that provides leisure services, and in particular hospitality services, such as cafes and restaurants to meet a demonstratable demand. An increase in the number of people living in the town centre will support a vibrant economy, ensure the efficient use of land and deliver sustainable communities going forward. Projects will be supported that provide Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040      Development strategy & climate change

 linkages between the traditional town centre and the Riverside Waterfront, and 
Northern Town Centre. 
 
1.29 – Development in Stafford town will provide high quality and well -designed  
buildings and spaces, supporting and enhancing its attractive sense of space, in accordance with design policies. Existing infrastructure within the town will be sustained and enhanced, and  new infrastructure will be delivered where required, in 
accordance with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan and Policy 3 7 Infrastructure to 
support new development and to achieve the objective of the Local Plan. Green Infrastructure within Stafford town will be protected, enhanced and extended as shown in Policy 4 6 Green and Blue Infrastructure Network. As the main centre  of 
services, Stafford town will maintain and enhance connections throughout the 
borough. Development  over the plan period will aim to reduce the need to travel and 
will prioritise sustainable transport in accordance with Policy 52 Transp ort. 
 
1.30 – Stafford town encompasses a variety of heritage assets and natural 
landscapes.  These assets and landscapes are to be preserved and enhanced for 
the future and will aid in encouraging tourism within the borough. As indicated in 
Policy 14, a masterplan will be prepared for the delivery of the Penk and Sow Countryside Enhancement Area, which will provide a major nature conservation and recreational resource for the town of Stafford.

 Stone settlement strategy  
 
Housing  
Stone town will continue to meet housing requirements by providing approximately 
881 new market and affordable homes  2020- 2040.  
 New housing development will be provided at a range of development locations as identified on the policies map, and in accordance with Policy 12 Other  housing 
land allocations.  
 Economy  
Employment growth and the promotion of economic diversification will be provided through the completion of existing employment land commitments as detailed in Appendix 7.  
 Land identified as an employment use will be protected as employment land in accordance with Policy 16 Protection of Employment Land.  
 Stone town centre will support Stafford Borough over the plan period as a key 
market town. All new development proposals within Stone town centre should enhance the appeal of the centre and encourage longer visits in accordance with Policy 19 Town Centres and Main Town Centre Uses. A more flexible approach to appropriate uses i n the centre would potentially support a more diverse range of 
activity and encourage the use of vacant units and/or the redevelopment of underutilised buildings.  
 Design and Infrastructure 
Development will be required to prioritise sustainable transport and, where possible, enhance or provide infrastructure for walking, cycling and public 
transport, in line with Policy 52.  
 
Environment  
The historic environment will be preserved and enhanced to help encourage tourism within the borough, together with the Trent & Mersey canal. Stone town’s unique character and heritage will be promoted. Any residential development will not damage the integrity of the Cannock Chase Special Area of Conservation (SAC) if within 15 km of this designation, nature conservation interests and Local Nature Reserves. An enhancement area will be delivered within the plan period, as indicated in Policy 15 Stone Countryside Enhancement Area  
 
 
1.31 – Stone is an important  market town and second principal town and main 
provider of services, facilities, employment and transport links. Reflecting its role as 
the second settlement of the settlement hierarchy set by Policy 2 Settlement Hierarchy, the strategy for Stone town will seek to enhance its role by increasing Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040      Development strategy & climate change

 1.32 – The development strategy for Stone aims to meet the borough’s housing 
requirements through a number of housing site allocations as shown in Policy 12. As 
well as these site allocations, the Local Plan’s detailed policy framework will steer the type and quantity of development that will happen within Stone.  
 
1.33 – Stone will promote employment growth and maintain economic diversification 
within the borough through the completion of existing commitments as detailed in Appendix 7, which will maintain an attractive environment and ensure an efficient use of land. Stone will continue to support and encourage opportunities for new enterprises and start -up businesses, and employment land will be protected in 
accordance with Policy 16 Protection of Employment Land.  
 
1.34 – Stone town centre will continue to be a key market town within the borough. 
According to the Stafford & Stone Town Centre Capacity Assessment 2019, Stone town  centre  is generally healthy. Development within Stone town centre is limited 
due to the character and compact layout of the town centre, and so developments that seek to provide an amalgamation of vacant units will be encouraged to help meet the needs of modern retailers. Further delivery of leisure services, particularly hospitality services, such as cafes and restaurants, will be encouraged to meet the retail requirements of the town.  
 
1.35 – Development in Stone will provide high quality and well- designed buildings 
and spaces, supporting and enhancing its attractive sense of pl ace, in accordance 
with design policies. Existing infrastructure within the town will be sustained and enhanced, and new infrastructure will be delivered where required, in accordance 
with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan and Policy 37 Infrastructure to support new 
development. Green Infrastructure within Stone will be protected, enhanced and extended as shown in Policy 46 Green and Blue Infrastructure Network. Stone will 
maintain and enhance connections throughout the borough, and over  the plan period 
will aim to reduce the need to travel and require development to prioritise sustainable 
transport in accordance with Policy 52 Transport.  
 
1.36 – Stone encompasses a variety of heritage assets and natural landscapes.  
These assets and land scapes are to be preserved and enhanced for the future and 
will aid in encouraging tourism within the borough. As indicated in Policy 15, a masterplan will be prepared for the delivery of the Stone Countryside Enhancement Area, which will provide a major nature conservation and recreational resource for the town of Stone.  
 
POLICY 2.  Settlement hierarchy  
 
A. The settlement hierarchy fo r the borough is set out in the table within  this 
policy. New development will be of a scale commensurate with the position 
of the settlem ent in the hierarchy.

 B. In accordance with Policies  1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, the development of new 
housing and workplaces will be focussed on Stafford, Stone and 
Meecebrook Garden Community.  
 
C. National Green Belt policy will be applied in the borough’s Green Belt areas  
in accordance with Policy 5.  
 
D. Within the settlement boundaries  identified on the policies map and 
associated inset maps development will be supported subject to its 
compliance with other policies of this plan.  
 
E. Outside of the settlement hierarchy in the open countryside new 
development  will be restricted and Policy 3 of this plan will apply . 
 
Table: Settlement hierarchy

Seighford, Swynnerton and Tittensor . 
 
2.1 – Policy 2 provides the framework for decisions about the appropriate sc ale and 
location of new built  development within the borough.  
 2.2 – The settlement hierarchy is informed by the Settlement Assessment and 
Profiles ( 2022) which analysed the size and level of facilities of the borough’s 
settlements.  
 2.3 – By focussing new development on the higher tiers of the settlement hierarchy 
the development strategy in Policy 1 ensures that it takes place in the most 
sustainable locations. It also encourages the efficient re- use of brownfield land.  
 2.4 – The plan provides opportunities for settlements to growth and thrive through:  
 ●  Site allocations for housing under Policy 12 ; 
 ●  Support for rural and entry level exception sites in Policy 25; 
 ●  Support for home working and small -scale businesses, including offices, under 
Policy 18; and  Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040      Development strategy & climate change  
 
 
 
 
 
35                              
↑ Return to contents page  
  
●  Support for new small -scale shops and other main town centre uses in Policy 19 . 
 
POLICY 3.  Development in the open countryside  – general principles  
 
A. Outside of settlement boundaries defined on the policies map, and outside 
of the Green Belt (within which development will be  controlled in 
accordance with national policy), in order to protect the countryside from 
unnecessary and incongruous development only the following categories of 
development will be supported:  
 
 1. Development within Recognised Industrial Estates consistent with Policy 
17; 
 
 2. Home working and small -scale employment uses which accord with 
Policy 18; 
 
 3. Agricultural  and forestry  development in accordance with Policy 20;  
 
 4. T ourism  development , consistent with Policy 21 and development at 
canals consist ent with Policy 22 ; 
 
 5. Recreation uses appropriate to a rural location;  
 
 6. R enewable energy generation, in accordance with Policy 40 ; 
 
 7. Rural exception sites and entry level exception sites in accordance with 
Policy 25; 
 
 8. N ew dwellings that accord with policy 26; 
 
 9. The replacement or  extension of existing dwellings in accordance with 
Polic ies 27 and  28; 
 
 10 . Essential  infrastructure  for transport, telecommunications, power 
supply, security, waste management, water supply, wastewater, flood 
risk, and the extraction of minerals ; and  
 
 11. Development that is in accordance with a formally  made neighbourhood 
plan.  
 
B. Development in the  open countryside  must  where deemed acceptable in 
principle a nd in accord with other policies in this plan: 
 
 1. Make use of suitable existing buildings or previously developed land 
rather than using greenfield land;

36                              
↑ Return to contents page  
  2. Be well related to an existing far mstead or group of buildings, or be 
located close to an established settlement, except where there is an 
agricultural or other justification for a use in a specific location;  and 
 
 3. Be complementary to, and not prejudice, viable agricultural operations  or 
other existing viable economic uses.  
 
3.
1 – As a counterpart to the settlement boundaries defined on the policies map, this 
policy defines those categories of development that are acceptable in the countryside outside of settlement boundaries.  The aim of this policy is to protect the 
open countryside for its own sake by identifying the categories of development that the council will support. Other types of development which would be inappropriate or 
incongruous in the countryside will not be supported.  
 
3.2 – The policy, and the policies to which it links,  reflects national planning policy on 
those categories of development that are acceptable in the countryside.  
 3.3 – By restricting development in the open countryside to the categories specified, 
the policy and the settlement boundaries encourage the efficient re- use and 
redevelopment of previously developed ‘brownfield’ land within settlements.  
 
POLICY 4.  Climate change development requirements  
 
A. Proposals must demonstrate that all resources are used efficiently, as part 
of the construction and operation of a building. All major development 
should set out how embodied emissions have been taken into consideration 
through the production of an embodied carbon assess ment.  
 
Net zero operational energy: residential  
 
B. In order to demonstrate net zero carbon operational energy, all new 
dwellings  must demonstrate through an energy statement, that the following 
have been achieved:  
 
 1. No on-site fossil fuel  combustion; 
 
 2. Energy use is minimised, demonstrated through space heating demand of 
less than 15kWh/m2/year and operational energy use of l ess than 
35kWh/m2/year ; and 
 
 3. On- site renewable generation is maximised, equivalent to at least the on -
site energy demand.  
 
 Alternatively, compliance can be  demonstrated through Passivhaus  
Standard accreditation, using the Passivhaus Planning Package.

 Net zero operational energy: non residential  
 
C. In order to demonstrate net zero carbon operational energy, all new  major  
non- residential development must demonstrate through an energy 
statement, that the following have been achieved:  
 
 1. No on-site fossil fuel  combustion; 
 
 2. Energy use is minimised appropriate to the end use;  
 
 3. On-site renewable energy generation is maximised, equivalent to the on -
site energy demand; and  
  
 Altern atively, compliance can be demonstrated by using BREEAM Excellent 
level accreditation, with outstanding level for energy use (Credit Ene01) or 
through an alternative compliance route with prior agreement.  
 
D. Residual energy demand for new residential and non- residential buildings 
should be met through onsite renewable energy schemes, but if this is not 
technically feasible, the requirement may be met elsewhere by means of 
offsite renewable energy generation. Where this is the case, the 
development proposal must demonstrate how additional renewable energy 
generation is procured to make up the on- site shortfall in generation.  The 
offset mechanism will require agreement with the c ouncil.  
 
Other requirements  
 
E. Development must also:  
 
 1. Incorporate water efficient features and equipment into all new residential 
development to achieve a  maximum water usage of 110 litres per person 
per day ; 
 
 2. Follow the principles of the energy hierarchy ; and 
 
 3. Demonstrate through the energy statement and/or design and access 
statement (where applicable) that opportunities to incorporate 
sustainable design features where feasible (such as rainwater harvesting 
and greywater recycling, green roofs, maximising use of recycled 
materials, orientating buildings to optimise solar gain)  have been 
maximised .

1 – The Climate Change Committee report The Sixth Carbon Budget: Buildings 
states that the built environment is estimated to account for 23% greenhouse gas emissions (both direct and indirect) in the UK. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the built environment is therefore essential to contribute to the UK-wide target 
of achiev ing net zero emissions by 205 0.  Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040      Development strategy & climate change

4.2 – A building’s energy use is now considered to be the best measure for net zero 
compliance since the electricity grid is decarbonising. Total energy use and space heating metric targets are considered to be the best mechanism to model and monitor net zero compliance in new buildings. The net zero operational energy approach follows the principles of the energy hierarchy.  
 4.3 – The energy hierarchy refers to first:  
i. Reducing the energy load of the development.  
ii. Maximising the energy efficiency of the development.  
iii. Delivering on- site low carbon or renewable energy systems.  
iv. Delivering carbon reductions through off -site measures.  
 4.4 – The design of a building should prioritise energy reduction through highly 
energy efficient fabric measures, lighting, ventilation, and orientation. To demonstrate that measures to reduce the risk of the building overheating have been 
integrated into all developments, the Good Homes Alliance Tool and Guidance – Overheating in New Homes should be used. Once energy demand is minimised and efficiency design measures are in place, renewable energy technologies will be used to meet residual energy demand  
 4.5 – The requirement to have no onsite use of fossil fuel combustion supports the 
national requirement that all new homes from 2025 will be banned from installing gas and oil boilers and will instead be heated by low -carbon alternatives. If buildings are 
construct ed now which do not achieve net zero standards, these will need to be 
retrofitted later to meet the net zero requirements. This will be far more costly and inconvenient.  
 4.6 – To ensure that new buildings are as energy efficient as possible and will not 
need retrofitting in the future, renewable energy offsetting must only be used where it is demonstrated that it is not technically viable to meet the residual energy demands through onsite renewable energy generation. The UK Green Business Council guide – Renewable Energy Procurement and carbon offsetting guidance for Net Zero 
Carbon Buildings should be used to determine the best approach.  
 4.7 – Since The Southern Staffordshire Councils Water Cycle Study (JBA, 2020) was 
prepared, the Environment Agency has  updated its classification and it identifies 
southern Staffordshire as a seriously  water stressed region. On that basis the Water 
Cycle Study  recommends that planning policy is used to require the 110l/person/day 
water consumption target permitted by National Planning Policy Guidance in water -
stressed areas. This is consistent with climate change adaptation. A planning condition will be imposed on all planning permissions for housing requiring this to be met.  4.8 – Mitigating and adapting to climate change will be achieved through this policy  
and through climate- change related aspects of other policies of this plan. In 
particular:  Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040      Development strategy & climate change

●  Adherence to the development strategy and settlement hierarchy which is designed to reduce transport -based emissions by min imising the need to travel.  
 ●  Delivery  of the flood risk, drainage, sustainable transport and renewable energy 
solutions planned across the borough . 
 ●  Achievement of major enhancements to flood management and green infrastructure provision within Stafford and Stone through the Countryside Enhancement Area projects in policies 14 and 15. 
 ●  Provision of multi -functional open space in all development in accordance with 
Policy 46. 
 ●  Encouraging the development of new renewable energy generating capacity in appropriate locations in accordance with Policy 40. 
 ●  Minimising the vulnerability of  new development to flooding and delivering 
sustainable urban dr ainage in accordance with Policies 42 and 43. 
 ●  Promoting sustainable transport and the transition to electric vehicles through policies  52 and 53. 
 
POLICY 5.  Green Belt  
 
A. The borough’s Green Belt  boundaries are identified on the policies map.  
 
B. Inappropriate development will not be permitted in the Green Belt unless 
very special circumstances exist. Development proposals, including those 
involving previously developed land and b uildings, in the Green Belt will be 
assessed against  the relevant national planning policy.  
 
C. The openness of the Green Belt will be protected from inappropriate 
development in accordance with national planning policy.  
 5.
1 – The borough conta ins two areas of Green Belt. An e xtensive part of the north 
of the borough lies within the North Staffordshire Green Belt while part of  the south-
eastern area of the borough is designated as part of the West Midlands Green Belt.  
 5.2 – The purposes of the Green Belt are:  
 ●  To check the unrestricted sprawl of large built -up areas;  
 ●  To prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another;  
 ●  To assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment;

↑ Return to contents page  
 ●  To preserve the setting and special character  of historic towns;  
 
●  To assist in urban regeneration, by  encouraging the recycling of derelict and  
 other urban land.  
 5.3 – The boundaries of the Green Belt are shown on the policies map. Those 
boundaries are not altered through this plan as it is not considered that exceptional circumstances exist which would justify the removal of land from the Green Belt  nor 
likewise the addition of more Green Belt land.  
 5.4 – Policy 2 7 deals with the replacement of existing dwellings in the G reen Belt. 
Policy 3 0 covers gypsy and traveller sites in the Green Belt.  
 
POLICY 6.  Neighbourhood plans  
 
A. Except for thos e policies listed in Appendix 5 (Superseded policies), 
policies of made neighbourhood plans remain in effect and will be given 
appropriate  weight in accordance with national policy.  
 
B. Neighbourhood plans must be in broad accordance with the strategic 
policies of this Local Plan. The strategic policies are policies 1, 2. 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 19, 23, 24, 30, 48. 
 6.1
 – This policy provides clarity over the status of policies in made neighbourhood 
plans. It also identifies the strategic policies of this plan with which neighbourhood plans that are prepared in future will need to be in broad accordance.  
 6.2 – If neighbourhood plans prepared in future conflict with  non-strategic policies of 
this Local Plan, then once they have been brought into force, the policies of the neighbourhood plan will take precedence  over those policies of this Local Plan.  
 6.3 – National policy  in paragraphs 66 and 67 of the National Planning Policy 
Framework  states that strategic policies should set out a housing requirement for 
designated neighbourhood areas which reflects the overall strategy for the pattern and scale of development and any relevant allocations.  
 6.4 – However, this Local Plan does not set out a housing requirement for any 
designated neighbourhood area within the borough and future neighbourhood plans 
have not been relied up on in meeting the borough’s housing requirement.  
 6.5 – If existing or new designated neighbourhood areas progress neighbourhood 
plans, the  borough council will provide them with an indicative figure for new homes 
based on the latest evidence of  local housing need, the population of the 
neighbourhood area and the adopted local plan strategy.

7.
1 – The NPPF  identifies that the supply of large numbers of new homes can often 
be best achieved through planning for larger scale development, such as new 
settlements, provided that they are well located and supported by necessary 
infrastruct ure and facilities (including a genuine choice of transport modes).  
 7.2 – Plan-making authorities are encouraged to identify opportunities for such large-
scale development,  and it is recognised that such developments can extend beyond 
a single plan period as part of a 30- year vision  (See N ational Planning Policy 
Framework  2021 footnote 37 and paragraph 22). Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                     Meecebrook Garden Community

applications will be strongly encouraged to be subject to design review.  
 
8.1
 – The concept masterplan and design and development principles at Appendix 9 
and the Meecebrook Framework Masterplan Supplementary Planning Document detail how Meecebrook will be developed to be a place that is sustainable and well designed.  
 8.2 – The Framework Masterplan SPD, concept plan and design and development 
principles provide the overarching  tier of design requirements which will be 
elaborated  on in more detail  through the neighbourhood masterplans and design 
codes and then through the design of individual parcels and phases. The 
Meecebrook Framework Masterplan SPD is proposed to be adopted alongside or 
shortly after this local plan.  
 8.3 – Neighbourhood masterplans and design codes will be prepared by 
developers/site promoters/landowners in collaboration with relevant stakeholders as listed in paragraph B. These documents will be approved by the local planning 
authority  either  linked to the grant of permission a t outline  stage  (or discharge of a 
planning condition under an outline planning permission) or separately as a 
Supplementary Planning Document . The Framework Masterplan SPD will identify 
the neighbourhoods/character areas in respect of which neighbourhood masterplans need to be prepared.  
 8.4 – The approach outlined in this policy utilises  the key tools of design coding, 
masterplanning and design review to secure good design as recommended in national policy and guidance.   
 8.5 – Stafford Borough does not have a local design review panel, however 
design:midlands provide a regional design review panel  which developers are 
encouraged to engage with in developing their proposals .

POLICY 11.  Stafford  Station  Gateway  
 
A. Land in Stafford between the railway line, Newport Road, Kingsway, Martin 
Drive and Reed Drive as shown on the policies map is allocated for mixed 
use development. Any application for development on a part or the whole of 
the site should be consistent with  the Stafford Station Gateway Strategic 
Regeneration Framework for the whole site allocation. Any application for a 
component of the whole site must be accompanied by a specific master 
plan which shows the relationship of the application area to the wider site 
allocation  and the stated Framework . The design of any application for part 
of the allocated area shall not prejudice the delivery or design of the wider 
site area. Development must deliver the following key requirements:  
 
 1. Provide new and improved  bicycle and pedestrian routes within and 
across the site linking to Stafford town centre in accordance with the 
Stafford Station Strategic Regeneration Framework . 
 
 2. Provide a new toucan crossing across the Stafford Western Access Road 
to link the north and south of the site.  
 
 3. Create a new western station entrance and ‘station square’ public space.  
 
 4. Close Castle Street to through traffic except for buses and improve this 
as a pedestrian and cycle link to the town centre.  
 
 5. Improve off -site pedestrian and cycle routes along Newport Road linking 
to the town centre.  
 
 6. Locate higher density development, non- residential uses and taller 
buildings close to the new station western entrance with densities and 
building heights stepping down to the north. An exception to this is on 
the north edge of the lake  and on the triangle of land lying to the east of 
the Doxey Road/Unicorn Way roundabout adjacent to the railway line 
which are appropriate location s for mid -rise apartment develo pment.  
 
 7. Create a landscape- led development that delivers a network of green and 
blue spaces throughout the site, including the naturalisation and creation 
of public access to Doxey Brook. The design of the development shall be Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040       Site allocation policies

 informed by a site -alloca tion-wide flood risk assessment and sustainable 
drainage strategy that demonstrates how flood risk will be managed 
across the site.   
 
 8. Provide a mix of apartments and houses together with offices and 
workspaces.  
 
 9. Provide food and beverage and conve nience retail uses not exceeding 
1,400sqm of floorspace in total across the site allocation to serve the 
future residents and users of the development. Such uses should not be 
of a scale or type that would compete with Stafford town centre.  
  
 10. Deliver  high- quality design in line with the aspirations of the Strategic 
Regeneration Framework.  
 
B. The development will be required to contribute to s chool expansion as  
required to accommodate pupils from the proposed development.  
 
11.
1 – Stafford Station Gateway will be a mixed- use development of partly 
brownfield land in central Stafford. It has potential to deliver circa 900 homes, depending on the mix of  apartments and houses, together with new office space and 
other workspaces. In addition , it is anticipated that the development will include a 
hotel and multi -storey car park.  
 11.2 – The development creates an opportunity to deliver higher density housing and 
new workspaces in a sustainable location alongside a new  quality  western access to 
Stafford Station.  
 11.3 – The floorspace of food and beverage and retail uses is restricted to avoid 
undermining the role of Stafford town centre.  
 11.4 – The Stafford Station Gateway Strategic Regeneration Framework is being  
prepared to guide the future development.

D. The development of all sites will need to accord with other policies in this 
Local Plan, with the infrastructure needs of each site to be secured through 
legal agreements where appropriate.  
 
12
.1 – In accordance with the policies 1 and 2, land is allocated for housing 
development in accordance with the settlement hierarchy.  Two sites in Stafford are 
marked with an asterisk (*)  in the above table. These sites are brownfield sites within 
the settlement boundary that are allocated for redevelopment for housing but are not counted in the housing trajectory  for the plan period. The s ites in question are not 
currently achievable and to  come forward they will need to demonstrate that they can 
address education capacity constraints.   
 12.2 – By allocating housing development sites in a range of locations and of 
different sizes the Local Plan will seek to maintain a five -year supply of deliverable 
housing sites across the plan period.  
 12.3 – As set out in the glossary, ‘employment develop ment’ means development for 
uses within class B2 and B8 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040       Site allocation policies

 1987, together with uses falling within class E(g)(ii) and (iii) and, subject to 
compliance with other policies of this plan, class E(g)(i) . 
 12.4 – Additional employment land is allocated to provide shorter term supply in 
response to market signals showing low vacancy on existing employment land and high levels of occupier demand within the borough. This employment land provides a buffer against non- implementation of existing commitments and additional short -term 
supply.   
 12.5 – The housing  and employment  site allocations made through this plan may be  
supplemented by site allocations made through neighbourhood plans.  
 
POLICY 13.  Local green space

 designation  made  through local and neighbourhood plans  that allows communities to 
identify and protect green areas of particular importance to them. It must be in 
reasonable proximity to and demonstrably special to the community it serves and hold particular local significance. It must also be local in character and not an extensive tract of land.   13.2 – As part of its call for sites the council invited local communities to put forward 
land for potential designation as Local Green Space.  
 13.3 – The council assessed the nominated sites and determined which of the sites 
were considered to meet the criter ia listed in national policy  and these sites are 
allocated through t his plan. 
 13.4 – National planning policy will be applied to the determination of planning 
applications which affect Local Green Space.  Under national policy Local Green 
Space is given protection equivalent to that afforded to Green Belt.  
 
POLICY 14.  Penk and Sow Countryside Enhancement Area  
 
A. Penk and Sow Countryside Enhancement Area as identified on the policies 
map will be cons erved and enhanced to provide a major nature 
conservation and recreational resource for  the town of Stafford.  
 
B. A masterplan for the delivery of t he Countryside Enhancement Area will be 
prepared . The masterplan  will identify actions  to improve the area’s 
biodiversity, public access, flood plain management and contribution to 
climate change adaptation.  
 14
.1 – The concept of enhancing the biodiversity value and public access  in Stafford 
on the Penk and Sow river corridors was first identified in A Green Infrastructure 
Strategy for Stafford the Strategic Plan ( November 2009) which set out proposals for 
Penk & Sow Natural Parklands .  
 14.2 – The Strategic Plan noted the contribution that the development of a 
countryside park could make to enhancing biodiversity in Stafford, managing flood risk and promoting the visitor economy, Th e Strategic P lan identified that the 
important  aspects of creating the Penk & Sow Natural Parklands would be:  
 ●  Provide links (access routes, gateways and interpretation) to surrounding communities, neighbourhoods and the wider recreational access network ,  
 ●  Increase the multifunctional (flood mitigation, recreation and biodiversity) potential 
of the p arklands through appropriate management ,  
 ●  Ensure that the p arklands are accessible to all members of the community and of 
all levels of ability .

 14.3 – The Stafford Borough Nature Recovery Network Mapping (Staffordshire 
Wildlife Trust, 2020) further highlights the rivers Penk and Sow as a wetland 
opportunity area, stati ng “The area around the confluence of the Rivers Sow and 
Penk present a potential opportunity for habitat enhancement and flood risk attenuation.” .  
 14.4 – The ‘Stafford Brooks’ project, a joint project of Staffordshire Wildlife Trust, 
Highways England, Stafford Borough Council and the Environment Agency will deliver a first stage of enhancements to the Penk and Sow rivers. Additionally, the High Speed 2 funded Environmental Enhancement Plan developed by the Trent Sow Group will enhanc e parts of the river corridor from Baswich to Shugborough. The 
Countryside Enhancement Area will continue the momentum generated by these 
projects.  
 
14.5 – A masterplan will be produced for delivery of a Countryside Enhancement 
Area al ong the lines envisaged in the Strategic P lan. The masterplan will guide 
interventions to create the Countryside Enhancement Area.  
 14.6 – In order to deliver the Countryside Enhancement Area , it is envisaged that  
Stafford Borough Council will work with Staffordshire Wildlife Trust, developers and private landowners. It is intended that delivery of the Countryside Enhancement Area will be supported by developers’ contributions including as a focus for off -site 
biodiversity net gain delivery in the Stafford area in accordance with Policy 47. 
 
POLICY 15.  Stone Countryside Enhancement Area  
 
A. Stone Countryside Enhancement Area as identified on the policies m ap will 
be conserved  and enhanced to provide a major nature conservation and 
recreational resource for the town of Stone .  
 
B. A masterplan for the delivery of t he Countryside Enhancement Area will be 
prepared . The masterplan will identify actions to improve the area’s 
biodivers ity, public access, flood plain management and contribution to 
climate change adaptation.  
 15
.1 – As with the Penk and Sow Countryside Enhancement Area, the concept of a 
Stone Canal and Riverside Park was proposed in A Green Infrastructure Strategy for Stafford the Strategic Plan (November 2009).  The Strategic Plan described the 
rationale for the Countryside Enhancement Area as follows:  
 “Creating an area of accessible land in the heart of Stone based around the two watercourses [the River Trent and the Trent & Mersey Canal] can ensure that most 
areas of the town can have access to green and open space of a natural essence. Combining access improvements for flood control and biodiversity enhancement measures, whilst retaining the majority of  the agricultural function of the space, will 
make this area between the two halves of the town a truly multifunctional space, and Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040       Site allocation policies

 contribute to the future sustainable prosperity of Stone providing recreation 
opportunities for the communities of the town and an attractive asset for visitors.”.  
 15.2 – The strategic plan identified the following actions as important  in providing the 
necessary enhancements:   
 ●  Create a series of  multiuser pathways within the park and linking to surrounding 
communities , 
  ●  Engage with landowners to increase biodiversity through changes in management , 
  
●  Install signage in and around Stone directing users to the park,  
 
●  Ensure that existing land uses such as farming are retained  
 15.3 – The Stafford Borough Nature Recovery Network Mapping (Staffordshire 
Wildlife Trust, 2020) identifies opportunities on the River Trent in Stone, including for bank re- profiling, creation of small scrapes and pools in the floodplain, and grassland 
diversity enhancements.  
 15.4 – A masterplan will be produced for delivery of a Countryside Enhancement 
Area along the lines envisaged in the strategic plan. The masterplan will guide 
interventions to create the Countryside Enhancement Area.  
 15.5 – In order to deliver the Countrys ide Enhancement Area, it is envisaged that 
Stafford Borough Council will work with Stone Town Council, Severn Trent Water , 
The Canal and Rivers Trust, developers and private landowners. It is intended that delivery of the Countryside Enhancement Area will be supported by developers’ 
contributions including as a focus for off -site biodiversity net gain delivery in the 
Stone area in accordance with Policy 47.

 POLICY 16.  Protection of employment land  
 
A. Land within the Protected Employment Areas, Recognised Industrial Estates 
and allocated employment sites shown on the Policies Map  or designated 
for employment use in a made neighbourhood plan will be retained in or 
developed for employment  use (as defined in the glossary)  unless there is 
demonstrated to be no reasonable prospect of the use of the land for those 
purposes  and the redevelo pment or use of  the site  for other purposes  would 
not undermine key local economic sectors or sites or the vitality and 
viability of town centres. 
 
B. Applications for non- employment uses of land to which paragraph A of this 
policy applies will only be permit ted where:  
 
 1. The application is supported by evidence demonstrating that the 
premises or site has been marketed for sale ( or where appropriate  let) in 
line with the es tablished use class without success for a continuous 
period of at least 24 months through a commercial agent with a practice 
connected to Stafford Borough, at a price that genuinely reflects the 
market value in relation to the use, condition, quality and location of the 
floor  space or site. A professional valuation of the asking price and/or 
rent will be required from the applicant to confirm that it is reasonable . 
The land/site must have been marketed for both its present use and for 
potential modernisation or regeneration for alterna tive employment uses ; 
and 
 
 2. Avenues to obtain public funding for site remediation / infrastructure 
improvements to support the viable employment use of the site have 
been fully explored; and 
 
 3. If employment redevelopment is shown through evi dence not to be viable, 
it is demonstrated that consideration has been given to alternative 
layouts and business uses, including mixed business and non- business 
uses (not including residential) , and smaller premises with short term 
flexible leases appropri ate for SMEs;  and 
 
 4. There is an adequate supply of available employment sites of sufficient 
size, layout and cost in the borough to cater for a range of business 
requirements. This would involve an assessment of vacant u nits o r land 
currently being marketed; and 
 
 5. If businesses are likely to be displaced through the proposed 
development, there is a supply of alternative suitable accommodation in 
the locality and within the borough as a whole to support local 
businesses and jobs without undermining sustainable communities and 
travel patterns by requiring long- distance commuting. This would involve 
an assessment based on  the council’s latest p ublished employment land Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040              Economy policies  
 
 
 
 
 
63

 supply evidence and details of vacant u nits and land currently being 
marketed ; and 
 
 6. The proposed development would not undermine the commercial 
attractiv eness of the employment area to other employment occupiers.  
 
C. A planning permission  for the use of land to which paragraph A of this 
policy applies for a use within Class E(g)(i)( ii) and (iii) of the Town  and 
Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 will be subject to a use- limiting 
planning condition controlling use for non- employment use s. 
 
D. Other land in employment  use or which is vacant but has a lawful 
employment use to which paragraph A does not apply will be retained in 
employment use. Proposed developments for such land for non -
employment uses will only be supported whe re: 
 
 1. The proposed redevelopment would provide housing; and 
 
 2. The proposed development  would not result in the loss of an important  
employment site which would be damaging to the economy of the 
borough or to the vitality  or viability of defined town or  local centre . 
 
E. Within Protected Employment A reas as defined on the policies map 
development for B2 and B8 use  classes and class E(g)(ii) and ( iii) will be 
supported. The development of Protected Employment Areas for class E(a) 
to (f) uses will not be supported.    
 
16
.1 – It is important to maintain a diverse range of workplaces of all sizes and types 
to allow for new start -ups, the expansion of existing businesses and inward 
investment to the borough.  The borough council will therefore resist the loss of 
employment premises and land unless in accordance with this policy . It is recognised 
that changes  in 2020 and 2021  to The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) 
Order 1987 and The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 reduce the ability of the council to control changes of the use of business 
premises  which fall within Class E. However, the bulk of employment land within the 
borough continues to be within Class B2 and B8.  
 16.2 – A two-tier approach is taken  in the policy. Land allocated for employment 
uses will be protected unless it can be demonstrated that there is no reasonable prospect of the land being used for that purpose. Other land in employment us e or 
which is vacant but has a lawful employment use, but is not specific ally allocated for 
these purposes within the plan, will be protected if it is an important employment site 
the loss of which would damage the borough’s economy or the vitality and viability of town centres. This is based on NPPF paragraph 123 (a) which supports the protection of key economic sectors or sites.   Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040              Economy policies  
 
 
 
 
 
64                              
↑ Return to contents page  
 16.3 – Under paragraph B. 6 of the policy a proposal for non- employment 
development of employment land can undermine the commercial attractiveness of 
the area or centre to other employment occupiers by, for example, undermining its 
employment character, introducing potentially incompatible neighbouring uses, or 
inhibiting access.  
 16.4 – Paragraph E of the policy provides support for the expansion or 
redevelopment of Protected Employment Areas for empl oyment uses, excluding 
offices . The conversion of Protected Employment Areas to retail and food and 
beverage uses  or other leisure uses  is an emerging trend. This reduces the land 
available to business occupiers while undermining the business function of 
employment areas and competing with town centres. Proposals for class  E(a) to (f) 
uses of Protected Employment Areas will be resisted.  
 
POLICY 17.  Recognised Industrial Estates  
 
A. Within the Recognised Industrial Estates at Hixon, Hixon Airfield, 
Ladfordfields, Moorfields, Pasturefields, and Raleigh Hall as defined on the 
policies map  the following uses will be permitted subject to compliance with 
other policies of this plan and provided there are no significant adverse 
impacts on the surrounding environment, nearby residents or transport 
networks:  
 
 1.  Light industrial ( E1(g)(ii) and (iii)), excluding E1 (g)(i) offices, general 
industrial (B2), storage and distribution (B8), or appropriate waste 
management uses;  
 
 2.  A limited element of retailing where this is ancillary to another main use 
under sub- paragraph 1; 
 
 3. Services, facilities and works specifically  provided for the benefit of 
businesses based on,  or workers employed within, the Recognised 
Industrial Estate;  and 
 
 4. Other employment -generating uses to enhance inward investment, such 
as those related to recreation and tourism, which meet local needs and / 
or promote the rural economy.  
 17
.1 – This policy supports Policy 3 by identifying the locations in which employment  
uses (as defined in the glossary ) will be supported in rural areas outside of 
settlement boundaries.  
 17.2 – The Recognised Industrial Estates are Hixon, Hixon Airfield, Ladfordfields, 
Moorfields, Pasturefields, and Raleigh Hall.  These sites perform an important role in 
providing employment in rural areas and as a focus for  supporting the rural 
economy.

 POLICY 18.  Home working and small -scale employment uses  
 
A. Home working, small scale employment and the development and 
expansion of small business es in residential and rural areas will generally 
be supported, subject to compliance with other policies of this plan.  
 
B. Proposals for small -scale offices of 100m2 or less within settlement 
boundaries will not be subject to the sequential test.  
 
C. In rural areas outside of settlement boundaries the re -use of redundant or 
disused buildings for employment  uses ( as defined in the  glossary,  
including class E (g)(i) offices with a gross floorspace of not greater than 
100m2) will be supported provided the building to be converted is 
structurally sound and capable of conversion without the need for extension 
or significant alteration or rebuilding and provided that the proposed use is 
complementary to, and would not prejudice, a viable agricultural operation 
or other existing viable economic use.  
 
18
.1 – In assessing proposals for small -scale employment and business uses under 
paragraph A of the policy particular regard will be had to Policy 50  on pollution and 
Policy 32 on residential amenity.  
 18.2 – The COVID -19 pandemic highlighted the likely future importance of home 
working,  and the council is keen to support this.  
  18.3 – Paragraph B provides support for small -scale offices in a range of locations.  
 18.4 – Paragraph C of the policy supports the re-use of existing buildings in the 
countryside for employment uses including small -scale offices. The policy 
implements na tional policy objectives of creating and supporting a prosperous rural 
economy.  
 
POLICY 19.  Town centres and main town centre uses  
 
A. Proposals  for main town centre uses should be located in defined centres 
identified on the policies map and listed in paragraph D of this policy  and 
should be of a scale appropriate to  the role  and character  of the centre in 
which they are being promoted. 
 
B. Except for small rural units in accor dance with paragraph C and  proposals 
that are in accordance with a site allocation policy in this plan or a made 
neighbourhood plan, applications for main town centre uses (including 
proposals for the subdivision, expansion, creation of mezzanine floors

  1.  They  satisfy the sequential test set out in national pl anning policy. The 
sequential test will be applied using the hierarchy of defined centres with 
priority given to higher tier centres. In applying the sequential test, 
flexibility on store format and (where the proposal comprises more than 
one unit) disaggregation shall be shown, and 
 
 2.  they would have a good standard of access by a choice of modes of 
transport, including public transport (they should lie within 400m of a 
public transport stop), bicycle and foot, and by people with disabilities, 
and 
 
 3. If they are above the floor area thresholds specified below, an impact 
assessment prepared in accordanc e with national planning policy  
demonstrates that the proposed development will not have a significant 
adverse impact on existing,  committed or planned public and private 
investment in a defined centre nor on the vitality and viability of a defined 
centre. The threshold for proposals within or immediately adjoining the 
Stafford settlement boundary is 1,000 m2 (gross) ; within or immediately 
adjoining the Stone settlement boundary the threshold is 500  m2 (gross); 
everywhere else in the borough the threshold is 300 m2 (gross).   
 
C. In tier 4 and 5 settlements, except for  Eccleshall  which has a designated 
local centre, and subject to compliance with other policies of this plan,  
applications for single units in main town centre use with no greater than 
200m2 in tradeable floor area will be permitted within the settlement 
boundary.  
 
D. The council will (if proposals  comply with other policies of this plan) 
support planning applications  that contribute to the diversification of uses 
in Stafford and Stone town centres and are in line with the settlement 
strategies set out in this plan.  
 
E. The hierarchy of centres is: 
 
 1. Stafford town centre  
 2. Stone town centre  
 3. Eccleshall local centre 
 4. Meecebrook town centre  
 5. Neighbourhood centres  and local shops  
 
19
.1 – Policy 19 provides a local reflection of national planning policy on the location 
of main town centre uses. Main town centre uses are  defined in the glossary. The 
policy applies a ‘town centre first’ approach in accordance with national policy, including the application of sequential and impact tests for applications for main town 
centre uses which are not located within a defined centre or in accordance with this plan or a made neighbourhood plan.

 19.2 – Town /local  centres for Stafford Stone and Eccleshall, the borough’s three 
main service centres, are defined on the policies map. Additionally, Meecebrook 
town centre, which is defined as part of the Meecebrook site allocation, will be 
brought forward during the plan period and will develop into a major service centre for the new  garden community.  
 19.3 – As recommended in the Stafford Town Centre Capacity Assessment  (TCCA)  
(2019), the policy retains thresholds for impact testing for Stafford, Stone and the rest of the borough which are below the national level . The Town Centre Capacity 
Assessment shows that there is no capacity for additional convenience retail over the plan period. Comparison retail, food and beverage and retail uses should be focussed on the defined town centres.  
 19.4 – Neighbourhood centres  and local shops  as defined on the policies map are 
Barlaston,  Gnosall, Great and Little Haywood, Haughton, Hixon, Tittensor, 
Woodseaves, Yarnfield, and Stafford neighbourhood centres /local shops  at Baswich, 
Bodmin Avenue, Holmcroft, Parkside, Rising Brook , Wildwood and Weston  
Road, and Stone neighbourhood centre at Walton.  Additional local 
centres/neighbourhood shops will also be developed at land north of Beaconside (North of Stafford allocation under policy 9 ) and Burleyfields  (West of Stafford 
allocation under policy 10). The edge of neighbourhood centres and local shops are  
not sequentially preferable locations.  19.5 – Following the approach taken in the Plan for Stafford Borough (2014) it is not 
proposed to introduce a retail frontages policy. The definition of primary and secondary retail frontages is no longer referred to in national planning policy  nor is 
deemed appropriate locally. It is considered that a frontages policy could inhibit the ability of centres within the borough to respond to changes in the retail market and diversif y. Additionally, changes to the Use Classes O rder mean that local authorities 
have little ability to prevent the change of use of retail units to other class E uses . 
 19.6 – The TCCA 2019 identi fies no quantitative  or qualitative requirement for 
additional convenience retail provision in the borough up to 2040. Convenience retail 
provision is therefore expected to be limited to the  provision of new facilities at 
Meecebrook  Garden Community, North of Stafford and West of Stafford and limited 
provision at Stafford Station Gateway in accordance with the site allocation policies for those developments, together with potential small local facilities in the borough’s 
smaller sett lements  in accordance with paragraph 19.C.  
 19.7 – The TCCA also notes the importance of anchor food stores within Eccleshall 
and Stone centres remaining in view of their importance in drawing residents to these centres  and creating linked trips with other  main town centre uses.  
 19.8 – The TCCA identifies a  requirement for 13,926 sq. m  of comparison retail 
floorspace over the plan period.  The TCCA recom mends that three quarters of this 
need is met in Stafford town centre with the remaining quarter to be met in Stone Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040              Economy policies

 town centre. New development in these locations will be supported to accommodate 
this. 
 19.9 – The TCCA identifies the potential for more small -scale comparison retail 
within Stone town centre, as part of mixed- use development. Alongside encouraging 
expansion of comparison retail in Stafford and Stone town centres, the council will encourage the expansion of the food and beverage and leisure offering of the centres.  The TCCA highlights potential capacity for an additional 4,092 s q. m of food 
and beverage floorspace by 2040 and this will be focussed on Stafford town centre in particular , on the Stafford Station Gateway allocation and also on Stone town 
centre.  
 
19.10 – As main town centre uses are trip- generators it is important that, if they are 
located outside of centres (after passing the sequential and exception tests), they 
are accessible by a range of transport modes. That avoids the exclusion from access to such facilities of those who do not drive by reason of age, disability, finances or choice. Access for people with disabilities will include dementia- friendly design.
 
POLICY 20.  Agricultur al and forestry  development  
 
A. The development of or extension to agricultural, forestry , or other land-
based rural business  buildings or structures will be supported where 
reasonably necessary in scale, construction and design to the operational 
needs of an agricultural, forestry or land- based rural  operation on that 
holding. The site selected and material s used must minimise visual 
intrusion and minimise  isolated buildings which are away from the existing 
nucleus of the farm . 
 
B. Diversification of agricultural holdings  will be supported, provided that the 
diversification is subservient to the main agricultural use of the holding. 
 20.
1 – The borough council wishes to encourage local food growing and land- based 
rural business. Local food growing reduces food miles and increases food security. This policy  therefore provides support for agricultural and forestry buildings  and other 
buildings for land- based rural enterprises . “Land- based rural business ” includes, in 
addition to agriculture and forestry, aquaculture and fisheries, the processing of food grown locally, horticulture, landscaping, nature conservation a nd veterinary activities.  
 20.2 – Development under this policy should also accord with Policy 3.B, including 
its requirement to re- use existing buildings where possible. Regard will also need to 
be had to policies on landscape, protection of residential amenity, and design.  
 20.3 – Requirements for planning applications to be supported by an agricultural 
need statement to demonstrate compliance with the policy  are set out in the Stafford 
Borough Council Development Management Planning Application Validat ion 
Guidance and Local Validation Criteria.  An agricultural needs statement explains Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040              Economy policies

 why the development is required  for the agricultural, forestry or other land- based 
rural business.  
 
20.4 – In cases where polytunnels require planning permission and do not fall within 
permitted development rights, they will be supported provided that they are located 
near to the main farm, are acceptable in terms of their landscape impact  and impacts 
on nearby residential properties and are otherwise in accordance with the policies of 
this plan . Particular care in the consideration of landscape impact will be needed 
within and in the setting of Cannock Chase AONB in accordance with Policy 4 5.  
 20.5 – Diversification of agricultural holdings is defined in  the glossary.  
 
20.6 – In paragraph B, subservient means that the new activity introduced does not 
become the main economic activity of the holding either in terms of turnover or land 
area.  
 
POLICY 21.  Tourism  development  
 
A. Tourism development (including theatres, museums, galleries and concert 
halls, hotels and conference facilities) is a main town centre use and should, 
except where in accordance with the paragraphs of this  policy, be located in 
defined town and local cent res in accordance with Policy 19 . 
 
B. Small scale t ourism and visitor accommodation proposals  will be supported 
if they meet the following criteria : 
 
 1. Where they comprise visitor accommodation outside of settlement 
boundaries, they are demonstrated to be viable through a robust, credible 
business case;  
 
 2. They are of an appropriate scale an d type  for their location;  and 
 
 3. They demonstrate high- quality design and respect the character of the 
countryside  or townscape in which they are  located . 
 2
1.1 – In accordance with national policy this policy supports sustainable rural 
tourism development.  As noted above, tourism is identified as a growth priority within 
the Stafford Borough Economic Growth Strategy 2020- 2025.  The borough council 
recognises the importance to rural tourism and supports local tourism business.  
 21.2 – A robust, credible business case will need to be submitted with visitor 
accommodation (see glossary definition) proposals under paragraph B of this policy to demonstrate that the rural tourism proposal would be viable.  
 21.3 – In determining whether or not a rural tourism proposal is small scale the 
council will have regard to the location, geographic scale and intensity of the use proposed. Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040              Economy policies

POLICY 22.  Canals  
 
A. New canal facilities and associated infrastructure will be supported if the 
following criteria are met:  
 
 1. The proposal is appropriate in scale to its locality;  
 
 2. Where located in the Green Belt, the proposal is consistent with national 
Green Belt policy;  
 
 3. Where the proposal is outside of settlement boundaries:  
   
  i.  there are no permanent moorings for residential purposes;  
 
  ii.  where the proposal comprises a marina or moorings it has only limited 
service facilities;  
 
  iii. it constitutes only uses that it is essential are located in proximity to 
the canal;  
 
  iv. the character  and attractiveness  of the countryside is protected; and  
 
  v.  external lig hting is kept to a minimum and is sensitively located;  
 
 4. Where possible, public access is improved;  
 
 5. The development does not have an adverse effect on water quality;  
 
 6. It does not create conflicts between different users of the canal, such as 
pedestrians and recreation users on / by the water;  
 
 7. Where the proposal is within a settlement the building fronts the  canal 
rather than turning its back to it ; 
 
 8. Wherever possible redundant canals and related buildings are restored 
and re -used; and  
 
 9.  Adequate provision for short -stay moorings and related facilities is 
incorporated, where appropriate.  
 
22
.1 – Stafford Borough is in a central location within the UK canal network with the 
Trent and Mersey, Shropshire Union and Staffordshire and Worcestershire canals 
running through.  Stone is a significant destination for canal -based recreation and 
tourism  with Norbury and the Haywoods also being  important . It is likely that there 
will be  proposals for development alongside canals and this policy sets out the 
approach that will be taken to determining planning applications for such proposals.   Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040              Economy policies

22.2 – The Canal & River Trust, the body responsible for maintaining the canal 
network in England and Wales, define a short stay mooring as a length of canal bank 
that’s been set aside for mooring periods of less than 14 days.  
 22.3 – Canal -based development has potential to support tourism and economic 
development in the borough. The policy supports such development and identifies criteria which canal -based development is required to meet. The policy seeks that 
development should improve public access to canals and provide building frontages which address the canals. However, the policy restricts new residential moorings and limits other types of canalside development in the open countryside in order to preserve the tranquillity  and attractiveness of the rural canal network.  
 22.4 – It is important to note that the entire length of the Trent and Mersey , 
Shropshire Union and Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canals within the borough 
are designated as conservation areas.

 POLICY 23.  Affordable housing 
 
A. Major development  (as defined in the glossary)  shall  provide the following 
proportions of all dwellings proposed on site as affordable housing:  
 
 1.  40% for greenfield sites and 10 % for brownfield sites within the following 
areas: the parishes of Adbaston, Barlaston, Berkswich, Brocton, Church 
Eaton, Eccleshall, Fr adswell, Fulford, Gayton, High Offley, Hilderstone, 
Ingestre, Milwich, Salt and Enson, Sandon and Burston, Standon, Stone 
Rural, Tixall.  
 
 2. 20% for greenfield sites and 5% for brownfield sites within the following 
areas:  the parishes of Bradley, Chebsey,  Colwich, Creswell, Ellenhall, 
Forton, Gnosall, Haughton, Hixon, Hopton and Coton, Hyde Lea, Marston, 
Norbury, Ranton, Seighford, Stone, Stowe -by-Chartley, Swynnerton, 
Weston, Whitgreave and the Stafford town wards of Rowley, Baswich, 
Weeping Cross & Wildw ood.  
 
 3. 10% for greenfield sites and 0% for brownfield sites within the following 
areas:  the Stafford town wards of Doxey & Castletown, Holmcroft, 
Common, Coton, Littleworth, Forebridge, Penkside, Manor, Highfields & 
Western Downs .  
 
B. Affordable housing sha ll be provided on site  unless provi sion on anot her 
site in the same settlement is proposed,  robustly justified and is consistent 
with creating mixed and balanced communities . A commuted sum will only 
be accepted in exceptional circumst ances where it is demonstrated that  
neither on- site nor off -site provision of affordable housing is feasible or 
viable . The commuted sum will be equivalent to the uplift in value resulting 
from the floorspace/units that would have been provided as affordable 
housing being delivered as unrestricted market housing.  
 
C. On-site affordable housing shall be distributed across the development site 
and not  clustered in to groups of more than 8 new homes  except where this 
is not possible because the development compris es flats . 
 
D. The appearance of affordable hou sing shall be indistinguishable from that 
of open market homes.  
 
E. Where a site, which if developed as a whole would constitute major 
development, is split in two or more sites which physically abut each other, 
any of which falls below the site size thresholds , the site will be treat ed as 
one site for the purposes of this policy.  
 
F. The tenure mix of affordable housing to be provided will consist of:  
 
 1. 65% social rented housing;  Stafford Borough L ocal Plan 2020- 2040                Housing policies  
 
 
 
 
 
75                              
↑ Return to contents page  
  2. 25% First Homes; and  
 3. 10% shared ownership.  
 
G. The unit size mix (in terms of number of bedrooms) of affordable housing to 
be delivered through this policy should be agreed with the  council’s  Health 
and Housing team l as part of the planning application process .  
 
23
.1 – The policy sets area- based affordable housing percentages  based on a 
Whole Plan Viability Assessment approach. The value zones for affordable housing 
are based on a residential market review (Aspinall Verdi, 2022). The value zones are shown on the map below: 
 
 23.2 – In accordance with national planning policy, affordable housing will only be 
sought from major development  proposals  (i.e. schemes of 10 dwellings  or more ), as 
defined in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).  
 23.3 – In accordance with national policy, 25% of affordable homes on site should be 
provided as First Homes .  
 23.4 – The Stafford Borough Economic and Housing Development Needs 
Assessment (Lichfields, 2020) (EHDNA) identifies that 70% of affordable hous ing 
need in Stafford Borough is for social rented homes. As noted above, 25% of 
Stafford Borough L ocal Plan 2020- 2040                Housing policies  
 
 
 
 
 
76                              
↑ Return to contents page  
 affordable housing is now to be provided as First Homes . On this basis, th e 65% 
balance of the affordable housing requirement  will be sought as social rent ed 
housing with the remaining 10% shared ownership. This tenure mix accords with 
national policy current at the adoption of this plan. The tenure mix will be reviewed in 
the event that national policy changes or if new local evidence on affordable housing needs becomes av ailable.  
 23.5 – The EHDNA also provides evidence of the size of affordable housing needed. 
This highlights a high level of need for 1 and 2- bedroom properties.  A need for 4-
bedroom houses has also been highlighted by registered providers. The council’s starting point is that, except in the case of town centre development, affordable 
housing should be delivered as houses  or maisonettes with private accesses  rather 
than as flats, due to difficulties with service charges  and the management of 
communal areas . In accordance with paragraph G of the policy, applicants should 
consult with the council’s H ealth and H ousing team to determine the current need for 
affordable housing in the borough at the time of the application and agree an appropriate size mix  in terms  of number of bedrooms . 
 23.6 – There is significant affordable housing need as detailed in the  EHDNA . The 
EHDNA identified a net affordable housing need of between 252 and 389 dwellings per year depending on the percentage of income devoted to housing costs. As is 
detailed above, affordable housing percentages are maximised and set by reference 
to viabilit y evidence.  
. 
POLICY 24.  Homes for life  
 
Accessible and adaptable dwellings  
 
A. On major development proposals for  residential  dwellings at least 1 0% of all 
new build dwellings distributed evenly across market and affordable tenures 
shall be built to Building Regulations Part M4(2) standards for accessible 
and adaptable dwellings . 
 
B. On developments, including mixed development s of market and affordable 
housing, that would provide 10 or more affordable dwellings, at least 10% of 
those affordable dwellings shall be built to Building Regulations part M4(3) 
wheelchair accessible standard.  
 
C. 100% of dwellings that are age- restricted g eneral housing, retirement 
housing or extra  care housing shall be built to Building Regulations Part 
M4(2) standards for accessible and adaptable dwellings.  
 
Internal space standards 
 
D. All new homes across all tenures will as a minimum meet the Government’s 
minimum  Nationally Described Space Standard (NDSS) .

 Private external space 
 
E. All new housing shall, unless there is a compelling justification for 
departure, provide at least the following levels of external private amenity 
space:  
 
 1. 3 or more bedroom houses - 65 square metres;  
 
 2. 2-bedroom houses - 50 square metres; and  
 
 3. Flats/maisonettes - a balcony or private space.  
 
Specialist housing 
 
F. Development that would lead to a reduction in the number of extra care, 
sheltered accommodation or care units available in the borough will not be 
supported unless  it can be demonstrated that:  
 
 1. Replacement specialist older persons’ accommodation will be provided ; 
or 
 
 2. The use was n ot viable; or  
 
 3. The existing accommodation has reached the end of its serviceable life.  
 
G. Proposals for age -restricted general housing, retirement housing, extra care 
housing or residential care facilities will be supported in principle. 
Proposals for extra care or residential care facilities should be located at 
Stafford, Stone, Meecebrook or at tier 4 or tier 5 settlements.  
 
H. The inclusion of conditions or planning obligations to ensure future 
occupation remains for the specialist housing need it was intended will be 
applied to permissions for specialist  housing.  
 
24
.1 – The Stafford Borough Economic and Housing Development Needs 
Assessment (EHDNA)  (Lichfields, 2020)  recommends that 10% of new housing 
across tenures is provided to Building Regulations M4(2) accessible and adaptable dwelling standards. This recommendation is co nservative and is based on an 
estimate that 62% of new households in the period 2020- 2040 will need accessible 
and adaptable dwellings but that some of that need will be met through the provision of wheelchair accessible housing or through households moving into C2 accommodation or extra care accommodation.  
 24.2 – The EHDNA  identifies that 7% of housing need across all tenures in the 
period to 2040 is for M4(3) wheelchair accessible standard housing, with need higher in the social rented sector. Government  guidance prohibits the use of planning policy 
to require a proportion of new build market housing to be wheelchair accessible, but Stafford Borough L ocal Plan 2020- 2040                Housing policies  
 
 
 
 
 
78                              
↑ Return to contents page  
 this is permissible for affordable housing.  As the EHDNA estimates 7% of affordable 
housing need will be for wheelchair accessible housing, rounding up to a more easily 
divisible number, 10% of affordable housing will be required to be wheelchair accessible housing.  
 24.3 – It should be noted that M4(2) cannot be applied if M4(3) applies and vice 
versa. This means that for major development, 10% of market and affordable dwellings should be M4(2) and (if the total number of affordable dwellings exceeds 10) a further 10% of the affordable dwellings should be M4(3).  
 24.4 – As it is anticipated in the EHDNA that 58% of older single person households 
and 59% of older couples’ households will have at least one person with a long -term 
health problem or disability, there is a clear justification for ensuring that this housing is accessible and adaptable.  
 24.5 – The government sets Nationally Described Space Standards that set 
minimum sizes to accommodate furniture, circulation and everyday activities. If the government updates these standards the council will apply the most up- to-date 
version. The standards will be applied to all proposals that create a new C3 residential dwelling including proposals for material change of use to residential or residential subdivisions. The policy will not apply to extensions to existing residential policies that do not result in the creation of a new dwelling.  
 24.6 – The COVID -19 pandemic highlighted the importance of access to outdoor 
space for people’s physical and mental wellbeing. National policy and guidance do not set a standard for external private space  nor prohibit the setti ng of local 
standards . Therefore, the policy provides minimum standards for the provision of 
external private space. Car storage areas will not count towards the meeting of these standards.  Amenity spaces must have a reasonable degree of privacy.  
 24.7 – T his policy supports the provision of older persons’ accommodation of all 
types within the borough.  
 24.8 – The Stafford Borough Economic and Housing Development Needs 
Assessment (EHDNA) (Lichfields, 2020) estimates that older households will make 
up the m ajority of future household growth in the Borough. Single person older 
households are expected to make up 47% of future growth, and when older couples are included this rises to 72%.  
 24.9 – The EHDNA models a need for around 466 bed spaces in care homes with 
nursing and around 525 bed spaces in care homes without nursing by 2040. These 
991 bed spaces are modelled on the basis that the same proportion of older households in 2040 will live in care homes as they do at present. As the EHDNA acknowledges, there is uncertainty over this in view of the potential for more people to remain in their homes longer.

 24.10 – Difficulties in projecting with certainty the need for supported and specialist 
housing within Stafford Borough, and how such housing can be delivered, means 
that it would be inappropriate to set fixed targets within the plan. Instead, the policy adopts a more flexible approach to provision.  
 24.11 – To meet the needs of an ageing population this policy seeks to protect the 
existing stock of care , extra care  and sheltered accommodation and support new 
provision of older persons' accommodation in appropriate locations. In line with 
national planning guidance the policy seeks to ensure that specialist older persons ’ 
accommodation is provided at settlements within the settlement hierarchy to provide  
better access to public transport, local amenities, health services and town centres.  
This will help to avoid social isolation and promote independence and community 
interaction.  
 
24.12 – Specialist housing is defined in the glossary.
 
POLICY 25.  Rural exception sites  
 
A. On sites o utside of but  directly  adjoining the settlement boundaries of tier 4 
larger and tier 5 smaller  settlements  and in other locations allocated in a 
‘made ’ neighbourhood plan the following categories of development will be 
supported in principle subject to compliance with other policies of this plan: 
 
 1. Proposals for entry level exception sites (as defined in the glossary)  
which are in accordance with national planning policy; and  
 
 2. Proposals for affordable housing exception sites which a re in accordance 
with paragraph B of this policy.  
 
B. Affordable housing exception sites must meet the following criteria:  
 
 1. The scale of the proposed development is appropri ate to the settlement at 
which it is located ; 
 
 2. The site delivers 100% affordable housing  in perpetuity  (provided that a 
planning obligation or other appropriate mechanism ensure s that the 
Right to Buy and Right to Acquire  on rented properties is excluded and 
that re-let or re -sale prices are capped to remain within the defin ition of 
affordable housing in perpetuity );  
 
 3. The local need for the housing is justified by local housing needs 
assessment  which demonstrates that there is a need for  the type, scale 
and tenure of the proposed affordable dwellings  in that location; an d 
 
 4. The provision of limited market housing within a site  will only be 
acceptable to assist with scheme viability, where  it can be demonstrated Stafford Borough L ocal Plan 2020- 2040                Housing policies

.1 – This policy reflects national policy on entry level exception sites and rural 
(affordable housing) exception sites. Criteria for rural exception sites in Stafford Borough are provided in the policy . 
 25.2 – In accordance with the policy, rural exceptions sites should adjoin tier 4 or tier 
5 settlements to provide access to services and facilities and avoid the creation of isolated new homes in the countryside.  
 
POLICY 26.  New rural d wellings  
 
A. New dwellings  or residential conversions in the countryside out side of 
settlement boundaries will not be supported unless:  
 
 1. The development would represent the optimal viable use of a heritage 
asset or would be appropriate enabling development to secure the future 
of heritage assets; or  
 
 2. The development would meet the functional need of a viable agricultural  
or forestry bus iness for an agricultural or forestry worker to live at or in 
the immediate vicinity of their place of work. S uch dwellings will be 
subject to an occupancy condition or planning obligation; or  
 
 3. The development would re -use an existing  redundant or disused building 
which is demonstrably structurally sound and capable of conversion 
without the need for extension or significant alteration or rebuilding and 
would lead to an enhancement of the immediate setting. The residential 
re-use of metal framed modern agricultural and indus trial buildings will 
not be considered appropriate ; or 
 
 4. Would be a design of exceptional quality which, in accordance with 
national policy, is truly outstanding, reflecting the highest standards in 
architecture, and would help to raise standards of design more generally 
in rural areas and would significantly enhance its immediate setting, and 
be sensitive to the defining charac teristics of the local area. 
 
B. The landscape impact of  proposals for new dwellings under this policy must 
be acceptable when assessed against  Policy 43.  
 
C. Proposals which fail to take the opportunity to make a positive contribution 
to the appearance of the locality will not be supported.  
 2
6.1 – This policy reflects national policy on the categories of new dwellings that will 
be supported in the countryside. It should be read alongside Policy 25 on rural exception sites.  Stafford Borough L ocal Plan 2020- 2040                Housing policies

 26.2 – Requirements for planning applications to be supported by an agricultural 
need statement to demonstrate compliance with the requirements for new rural  
workers ’ dwellings and for structural surveys to demonstrate structural soundness 
are set out in the Stafford Borough Council Development Management Planning 
Application Validation Guidance and Local Validation Criteria.  
 26.3 – Permitted development rights may be removed from new residential dwellings 
created through the conversion of existing buildings.  
 26.4 – Paragraph 2 of this policy applies to agricultural and forestry workers only, not 
to other land- based rural businesses.  
 
POLICY 27.  Replacement dwellings  
 
A. In areas outside of settlement boundaries as defined  on the policies map 
proposals for the replacement  of existing dwellings will be supported if all 
of the following criteria are met:  
 
 1. Where the local authority identifies that the existing dwelling is a non-
designated heritage asset, the applicant must demonstrate through 
evidence that it would not be  viable to retain and enhance through 
renovation and extension the existing dwelling;  
 
 2. The existing  dwelling has a lawful unrest ricted residential use and is not 
in a state of abandonment, partial or complete demolition or collapse;  
 
 3. The existing  dwelling is not the result of a temporary planning permission 
or of  a temporary form of construction or a caravan / mobile home;  
 
 4. Where appropriate , measures will be  taken to reuse or recycle materials 
from the existing  dwelling;  
 
 5. The replacement bu ilding will be more energy efficient than the existing  
dwelling;  
 
 6. The number of new dwellings  to be created  is no more than the number of  
dwellings to be replaced;  and 
 
 7. The replacement is positioned on the footprint of the existing dwelling,  
unless on design, landscape, highway safety, residential amenity, or 
other environmental grounds a n alternative location is more appropriate . 
 
B. Within the Green Belt a replacement dwelling should not be  materially larger 
than the dwelling it replaces.  
 
C. In areas outside of settlement boundaries (excluding Green Belt) as defined 
on the policies map the replacement of an existing dwelling should not Stafford Borough L ocal Plan 2020- 2040                Housing policies

 result in additions of more than 70 % to the floor area of the dwelling as 
originally built unless the existing floor area is less than 41 square metres, 
where development up to 75 square metres will be acceptable.  
 
D. The replacement of listed dwellings and dwellings which are non- designated 
heritage assets will not  be supported unless the application accords with 
applicable national policy on the total loss of heritage assets. Similarly, 
within conservation areas the replacement of existing dwellings which make 
a positive contribution to the character or appearance of the conservation 
area will not be supported unless in accordance with applicable national 
policy.  
 
E. Subject to paragraph D of this policy, within settlement boundaries the 
replacement of dwellings will generally be supported provided that the 
proposal accords with other policies of this plan.  
 
F. Permitted development rights may be removed from replacement dwellings . 
 
2
7.1 – This policy establishes the parameters for  the replacement of  existing  
dwellings.  
 27.2 – The policy does not support the replacement of listed buildings or dwellings in 
conservation areas which make a positive contribution to the character of the 
conservation area.  
 27.3 – For the purposes of paragraph C of the policy, ‘ dwelling  as originally built ’ 
means in relation to a building existing on 1st July 1948, as existing on that date, and in relation to a building built on or after 1st July 1948, as so built.  
 27.4 – Permitted development rights may be removed from replacement residential 
dwellings created through this policy to prevent disproportionate further extensions.  
 
POLICY 28.  Extension of dwellings  
 
A. Applications for extensions to existing dwellings will be supported subject 
to compliance with other policies of this plan (particularly those on design 
and residential amenity) and provided the extension is not disproportionate 
in size to the host dwelling.  
 
B. Proposals for extension to existing dwellings shall be in design harmony 
with the original dwelling and compatible with the character of the locality 
by observing the following design criteria. Extensions shall:  
 
 1. Not visually dominate the existing building;  
 
 2. Form an integral part (s) of the existing building and not appear as  an 
obvious addition(s); Stafford Borough L ocal Plan 2020- 2040                Housing policies

 3. Not be unduly detrimental to the privacy, outlook or natural lighting of a 
neighbouring property;  
 
 4. Take into account the roof design of the existing building;  
 
 5. Not form an obtrusive feature in the street scene; and  
 
 6. Be constructed of facing materials that either match or  suitably  
harmonise with the existing building.    
 
C. In areas outside of settlement boundaries as defined  on the policies map the 
extension or alteration of an existing dwelling should not result in additions 
of more than 70% to the floor area of the dwelling as originally built unless : 
 
 1.  The existing floor area is less than 41 square metres, where develo pment 
up to 75 square metres will be acceptable; or  
 
 2. The design and appearance of the proposed extension is proportionate to 
the type and character of the existing dwelling and the surrounding area ; 
or 
 
 3. The proposal is within the Green Belt where the extension sh all not result 
in additions of more than 30% to the floor area of the dwelling as 
originally built and should preserve the openness of the Green Belt.  
 
 2
8.1 – The policy provides general support for extensions and alterations to 
dwellings. Important considerations for such applications will include the design policies of this plan and considerations of neighbour amenity. Extensions should not be disproportionate in scale to the existing dwelling.  
 28.2 – The final part of the policy seeks to ensure that extensions of rural dwellings  
are proportionate . Such proposals  must also accord with Policy 35 (Architectural 
design) and the detailed guidance in the National  Design Guide.   
 28.3 – For the purposes of paragraphs C and D  of the policy, ‘original dwelling’ 
means in relation to a building existing on 1st July 1948, as existing on that date, and in relation to a building built on or after 1st July 1948, as so buil t. 
 
POLICY 29.  Residential sub -division and conversion  
 
The conversion of non- residential buildings to residential use or the sub-
division or conversion of existing dwellings  within settlement boundaries  will 
only be permitted where the proposed development would:

↑ Return to contents page  
  1. Not lead to an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenity, character  or 
appearance of the area, including through cumulative impacts due to over  
concentration of similar uses ; 
 
 2. If external alterations or extensions are needed to facilitate the 
conversion or subdivision, these must be of high- quality design and not 
be disproportionate in size to nor inconsistent with the character and 
appearance of the property or its setting;  
 
 3. Not involve the loss of community facilities protected by Policy 39; 
 
 4. P rovide satisfactory living accommodation in terms of size, amenity, 
facilities, private open -space provision, appearance and general outlook;  
 
 5. P rovide appropriate levels of on -site parking in accordance with Policy 
53; 
 
 6. I ncorporate sound proofing arrangements within and between properties;  
 
 7. N ot involve the self -containment of basement areas or other parts of any 
property having inadequate light or low ceilings or which would result in 
a poor outlook from main windows ; and 
 
 8. M ake adequate provision for refuse  and recycling  storage . 
 
29.
1 – This policy applies to the conversion of buildings to residential use (which for 
these purposes includes use classes C2, C3 and C4) and the subdivision or conversion of existing dwellings. This policy only applies to such proposal s within 
settlement boundaries. Proposals for the conversion of rural buildings to dwellings are covered by Policy 26. The subdivision of existing rural dwellings outside of settlement boundaries is not supported.  
 
POLICY 30.  Gypsy and traveller accommodation  
 
A. To help meet identified local need  for pitches for Gypsies and Travellers 
land is allocated  near  Hopton for at least 15 pitches and near Weston for at 
least 10 pitches as shown on the policies map and Appendix 2.  
 
B. Planning applications for Gypsy or Traveller accommodation or Travelling 
Showpersons’ plots on non- allocated sites must accord with national polic y 
and satisfy the following criteria:  
 
 1. T he site is accessib le to existing local services and facilities ;  
 
 2. T he site has safe and suitable vehicular access to the highway in 
accordance with Policy 5 2 and adequate  parking ;

85                              
↑ Return to contents page  
  3.  Provision of e ssenti al services including water supply, sewerage, 
drainage, and waste disposal  is sufficient to serve  the number of 
plots/pitches provided;  
 
 4. Sufficient facilities are provided for storage, play and  residential amenity;  
and 
  
 5. T he proposal is not of disproportionate scale to the nearest settled 
community . 
 
C. New traveller sites (whether temporary or permanent) in the Green Belt are 
inappropriate development and will not be approved except in very special 
circumstances.  
 
D. Development permitted  under this policy will be subject to a planning 
condition limiting occupation to Gypsies and Travellers or Travelling 
Showpeople, as applicable .  
 
E. Existing authorised sites for Gypsies and Travellers will be safeguarded 
from re development  for other uses  which would pre vent their continued 
occupation by these groups, unless acceptable replacement 
accommodation is provided or the site  is no longer required to meet 
identified need s. 
 
3
0.1 – In order to meet the Gypsy and traveller accommodation need s, this policy 
identifies sites to accommodate justifiable needs  and provides criteria for 
determining any planning applications that come forward on non- allocated sites. 
Those criteria will need to be applied alongside government policy for gypsy and 
traveller sites (currently Planning Policy for Traveller Sites  (‘PPTS')  2015) and other 
relevant policies of this plan, including in particular P olicy 42 (Flood risk), Policy 44 
(Landscapes) and Policy  50 (Pollution ) and Policy 3 2 (Residential amenity ) and other 
material considerations . 
 30.2 – The Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showperson Accommodation 
Assessment 2022 (Arc4, March 2022) identifies that over the plan period 2021/22 to 2039/40, there is an overall need for 48 additional pitches once expected turnover on 
the existing  council site  in the borough is considered (of which 22 P lanning Policy for 
Traveller Sites need and 26 non- PPTS need).  A site for at least 15 pitches near to 
Hopton and a site for at least 10 pitches near to Weston are  allocated  through this 
plan to contribute to meeting that need. These allocations meet the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites need. It is expected that sites to meet  the non- PPTS  need will 
come forward through the development management process and Policy 30 provides criteria against which planning applications will be assessed.  
 30.3 – Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS) need refers to the accommodation 
needs of those Gypsies and Travellers who continue to lead a nomadic habit of life, even if they are temporarily not travelling. Non -PPTS need or ‘cultural need’ refers to Stafford Borough L ocal Plan 2020- 2040                Housing policies

 the accommodation needs of e Gypsies and Travellers that no longer lead a 
nomadic habit of life. 
 
POLICY 31.  Housing mix and density  
 
A. New housing should contribute to the delivery of a range of housing types 
and sizes  within the area . Larger developments should deliver a mix of 
different dwelling sizes within the site. The council will  particularly support 
the delivery of  one or two be droom dwellings at the tier 4 and 5  settlements, 
for which there is particular need.  
 
B. On the following sites : Meecebrook, Land at Ashflats, Stafford; Land at 
Marlborough Road, Stone; Land East of Oakleigh Court, Stone; and Land 
east of Stafford Road, Gnosall  plots equivalent to 1% of all dwellings 
comprised in the development shall be made available to self or custom 
builders as serviced plo ts at reasonable market rates. Any such plots which 
remain unsold having been marketed for a period of at least 24 months may 
revert to delivery through conventional means . 
  
C. Residential densities should be informed by surrounding prevailing 
densities and landscape setting. There are t hree  main circumstances in 
which densities higher than those of the  surroundings will be supported:  
 
 1. In or at the edge of Stafford and Stone town centres, particularly where 
lower levels of parking provision are justified in accordance with Policy 
53; 
 
 2. On large developments where it is possible to create graduations of 
density and different character areas ; and  
 
 3. Where its design is of such high quality so as to outweigh concerns in 
relation to the impact of its density on the character and quality of its 
location and surrounding area.  
 3
1.1 – In accordance with national policy the Stafford Borough Economic and 
Housing Development Needs Assessment (Lichfields, 2020) identifies the mi x of 
different dwellin g sizes likely to be needed in the borough over the plan period. This 
is illustrated in the table below.  This mix is for all types of housing. The unit size mix 
needed for affordable housing may be different, as explained in policy 23 and its supporting text.  Stafford Borough L ocal Plan 2020- 2040                Housing policies  
 
 
 
 
 
87                              
↑ Return to contents page  
  
 
31.2 – The above table will not be applied mechanistically to planning applications 
for development in the borough but is intended as a guide to inform interpretation of 
the policy . However, as stated in the policy it is expected that larger developments 
will have regard to this evidence and deliver a range of dwelling sizes on site.  31.3 – The Economic and Housing Development Needs Assessment recommends 
that “Opportunities should be considered to provide smaller properties in the rural sub-area”.  
 31.4 – National policy requires local authorities to plan for people wanting to build 
their own homes. Local authorities are subject to a duty in the Self Build and Custom 
Housebuilding Act 2015 to maintain registers of those who have expressed an interest in self or custom build and grant sufficient consents within each base period to meet the need evidenc ed on the register.  As at January 2022 there were 63 
entries on the register.  
 31.5 – The policy seeks to secure opportunities for self and custom builders but 
deliver flexibility to allow ring fenced plots to be developed out by housebuilders in the event  that they remain unsold.  
 31.6 – In accordance with national policy, paragraph C of the policy supports an 
uplift to prevailing residential densities in appropriate locations  and circumstances  
thereby supporting the efficient use of land.  
POLICY 32.  Residential amenity  
 
A. Development will not be permitted which causes unacceptable effects on 
the residential amenity of neighbouring occupants or  does not provide for 
adequate levels of amenity for future occupants. In assessing the impact of 
development on the living conditions of occupants, regard will be had to the 
categories of pollution listed in Policy 50, together with the following 
amenity considerations:

  1. The protection from development  of adequate areas of usable private 
amenity space for the current and future occupiers of existing dwellings;  
  
 2. The provision of adequate  areas of usable private amenity space for the 
occupiers of proposed dwellings;  
  
 3. Loss of privacy and/or overlooking of windows of habitable rooms and 
private amenity space;  
  
 4. Overbearing impact / visual dominance;  
 
 5. Overshadowing of private am enity space ; and 
 
 6. Impact resulting from loss of outlook.   
 
3
2.1 – This policy seeks to protect residential amenity of both existing and new 
dwellings from a range of impacts.  It should be read in conjunction with Policy 50 
(Pollution) .  
 
POLICY 33.  Extension to the curtilage of a dwelling 
 
Proposals to extend the curtilage of an existing dwelling outside of settlement 
boundaries will not be permitted unless:  
 
 1. The proposa l enables the provision of private external amenity space in 
accordance with the standards in Policy 24 (Homes for Life); or  
 
 2. The proposal provides for an  existing  unsafe access to the highway, 
parking or turning arrangements to be improved and made safe . 
 33.
1 – A householder may want to extend the curtilage of their dwelling for a number 
of reasons. “Curtilage” i s not a term that is defined in statute and is only defined in 
common (judge- made) law.  A working definition is given in Permitt ed development 
rights for householders: Technical guidance (September 2019) as follows: “ - is land 
which forms part and parcel with the house. Usually it is the area of land within which the house sits, or to which it is attached, such as the garden, but for some houses, especially in the case of properties with large grounds, it may be a smaller area”.  
 33.2 – The council wishes to resist extensions to residential curtilages in the 
countryside because the cumulative effect of such extensions is to give an appearance of suburbanisation.  
 33.3 – Planning permissions for extensions to residential curtilages may be subject 
to planning conditions removing permitted development for ancillary residential structures (sheds, greenhouses etc.) if such restrictions are considered justified because the site is prominent in the open countryside and the allowance of normal permitted development rights could result in visually intrusive development Stafford Borough L ocal Plan 2020- 2040                Housing policies

 POLICY 34.  Urban design g eneral  principles  
 
Development proposals shall:  
 
 1.  Accord with the National Design Code, National Design Guide and any 
local design code;  
 
 2. Suit their  context  by identifying and responding to reinforce locally 
distinctive patterns of development  including  urban morphology, scale, 
mass, materiality and the natur al environment;  
 
 3. Create a place with a distinctive  identity that is cl early influenced by  and 
well related to  the positive characteristics of the local area including its 
history ; 
 
 4. Have a n open inter -connected street network to provide excellent 
legibility and easy movement both between constituent parts of the  new 
development (if applicable)  and beyond the development itself;  
 
 5. Utilise a hierarchical approach to street design and building design; 
 
 6. A void cul -de-sacs typologies (except as tertiary elements of the road 
network) where there are opportunities  to extend existing movement 
networks into and through the development  area to create a n integrated  
and connected urban structure;  
 
 7. Create clear and logical layouts that are easily navigable  by: 
 
  i.  Respecting and reinforcing local pedestrian desire  lines;  
 
  ii. Creating recognisable streets that are defined by buildings and open 
space  which has a clear function ; 
 
  iii. Preserving and/or creati ng new long- distance vistas, landmarks, 
skylines, landscape features and other memorable and recognisable 
features ; 
 
 8. Be compact and have streets designed in accordance with Manual for 
Streets to make walking (including wheelchair, disability scooter and 
pushchairs) and cyc ling the easiest way to make short, local journeys and 
to ensure vehicular parking does not dominate street scenes ; and  
 
 9. Be designed to minimise the risk of crime by providing adequate natural 
surveillance, clear definition of private and public space,  well- lit spaces, 
and by fronting public spaces with active frontages .

 34.1 – This plan sets the framework  for the creation of new residential 
neighbourhoods and employment areas. The policy is particularly applicable to 
development proposals which are of a major scale . However, a number of its 
principles will also be applicable to proposals which are minor development. The policy reflects the importan ce of new  developments reflect ing established principles 
of good urban design. Adherence to these principles will help create places that are attractive, function well and are adaptable over time.  Good urban design is also vital 
to delivering healthy, inclusive and safe places.   34.2 – This policy and policies 35 and 36 will be applied in the determination of 
planning applications in conjunction with the National Design Guide, National Model Design Code and Manual for Streets  (and any successor to or updated version of 
Manual for Streets) . 
 34.3 – The urban design principles set out in this policy accord with the Nati onal 
Design Guide but highlight  principles of particular importance to the required quality 
of new developments in Stafford Borough, particularly those of larger -scale.  
 34.4 – In accordance with national policy, proposals that do not adhere to these 
principles will be refused.  For large and complex sites, design review at an early 
stage will be encouraged to ensure proposals reflect these principles.  Design review 
would be paid for by applicants/proposed applicants. There are a number of design review panels available including  design:midlands.  
 34.5 – Early engagement with the council’s street naming and numbering team will 
help to support creation of legible places.  
POLICY 35.  Architectural design  
 
The design of buildings shall:  
 
 1. Be based on a clear understanding of the site and its context  and be 
appropriately sensitive to it ; 
 
 2. Demonstrate good qualities of composition, form and proportion that 
bring a natural sense of order and balance to the overall design ; 
 
 3. Be organised, coherent and functional in their  layout,  form and external 
appearance;  
 
 4. Unless there is a compelling justification f or a departure from them, 
follow locally prevalent patterns of scale, height  and massing;  
 
 5. Use contextually appropriate, durable and sustainable materials and 
achieve a quality of detailing that does not detract from the overall 
architectural quality; and

  6 Create a healthy, comfortable and safe internal and external environment.  
 
3
5.1 – This policy sets out the principles that will be used in assessing all proposals 
for buildings in the  borough to ensure they represent good design and are visually 
attractive as a result of good architecture, in accordance with national policy. Proposals that do not meet these principles will be refused.  
 35.2 – As explained in the National Design Guide, achieving a healthy internal 
environment means providing acceptable levels of amenity and light and avoiding the effects of pollution of all types (see also Policy 50). 
 35.3 – Under paragraph 4 of the policy, e xamples of a compelling justification for 
departing from locally prevalent patters of scale, height and massing include where:  
- the site occupies a prominent position within the townscape and this creates an 
opportunity to create a landmark building; or  - the nature of the proposed use, for example as a civic building or place of worship, 
warrants  a building of greater scale, height or massing.  
 35.4 – Specific policies  for residential buildings are provided in Polic ies 24, 27, 2 8 
and 29.  
 
POLICY 36.  Landscaping design  
 
A. Where they are proposed , public realm and landscape areas must be used 
as a structuring and ordering device and designed as a coh esive, integrated  
element of the development’s layout . 
 
B. Landscape and public realm areas should  use contextually sensitive and 
good- quality materials, avoid unnecessary  clutter and be  designed for 
inclusive access, safety and  ease of future maintenance. 
 
C. Any w atercourses and other natural features within the site should be 
designed as integrated and expressed elements of  the development and its 
layout.  
 
D. Where development borders an open landscape:  
 
 1. Development edges should be predominantly outward facing to activate 
adjacent space ; 
 
 2. Strong linear development edges should be “fragmented” by large, open 
green space corridors forming part of the development’s integrated green 
space network to avoid the creation of a visually harsh transition between 
built form and adjacent landscape; and  
 
 3. Edge of development planting should generally be utilised to filter views 
rather than blocking them.  Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                 Design and infrastructure policies

↑ Return to contents page  
  
E. Street trees and shrub planting shall be incorporated into street design in a 
manner that supports the distinctiveness and hierarchy of the road network 
and design of streets  whilst ensuring long term maintenance of the area  
unless, in specific cases, there are clear, justifiable and compelling reasons 
why this would be inappropriate . 
 
F. For dwellings, front boundary treatments should reinforce the prevailing 
character of the street.  
 
3
6.1 – Landscaping design,  which encompasses the design of streets and external 
private and public spaces , is as important as urban design and architectural design 
to the success of places. The three aspects need to cohere , work together  and be 
given equal attention. Accordingly, proposals which fail to meet the principles set out 
in this policy will be resist ed. 
 36.2 – There are significant links bet ween this policy and policies 46 ( green and blue 
network ), 43 (Sustainable drainage), 44 (Landscapes), 47 (Biodiversity),  and 52 
(Transport).  This policy should be read in conjunction with those policies.  Note tha t 
this policy is about the design of new landscaping within development, whereas Policy 4 4 (Landscapes) is about the impact of new development on the wider 
(existing) landscape.  
 36.3 – High quality landscape design will have multiple benefits of achieving greener, 
more pleasant places while helping respond to climate change and enhance biodiversity  and supporting a healthy and active lifestyle. 
 36.4 – This policy is particularly applicable to development proposals that are major 
development. However, its principles will be applicable to developments of all scales 
where areas of landscaping are proposed.  
 
POLICY 37.  Infrastructure to support new development  
 
A. New development that generates a demand for infrastructure will only be 
permitted if the necessary on and off -site infrastructure required to support 
and mitigate the impact of that development is either:  
 
 1. Already in place; or,  
 
 2. There is a reliable mechanism to ensure that it will be delivered in the 
most appropriate place, to the required standard and when required . 
 
B. Where applicable, planning obligations will be used to seek commuted 
payments to secure the necessary future maintenance of adopted 
infrastructure.

 37.1 – In accordance with national policy, local plans are required to set out the 
infrastructure required to support  development.  
 
37.2 – In this policy ‘Infrastructure’ includes (without limitation) education, health, 
transport, flood and water management, gree n infrastructure and public realm and 
their ongoing maintenance, biodiversity mitigation and digital infrastructure.  
 37.3 – A reliable mechanism may comprise a planning condition, a planning 
obligation under s106  of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, or an agreement 
under s278 of the Highways Act 1980. Developers may deliver necessary infrastructure themselves as part of development proposals , provided that  funded 
mechanisms are secured for long term management and maintenance.  It is 
recognised that contributions to long term maintenance and management will not be applicable to some types of infrastructure, for example health and education provision.  
 37.4 – This policy 37 requires infrastructure needs in general and provides a policy 
basis for the council to seek to secure contributions to mitigate the impact of development proposals on infrastructure. I nfrastructure needs may arise from 
(among others) Policy 4 (Climate change development requirements), Policies 14 
and 15 (Countryside enhancement areas), Policy 23 (Affordable housing), Policy 24 (Homes for life), Policy 46 (Green and blue infrastructure network), Policy 47 (Biodiversity), Policy 48 (Special Areas of Conservation), and Policy 52 (Transport).  
 37.5 – Additional ly, site-specific infrastructure requirements are identified in site 
allocation policies.  Site-specific infrastructure requirements for the development sites 
allocated in this plan are identified in Policies 7, 8 (and accompanying Appendix 9), 9, 10, 11 and 12 (and accompanying Appendix 2).  
  37.6 – In accordance with national policy, the Infrastructure Delivery Plan  (IDP) sits 
alongside this p lan and identifies the infrastructure needed to support delivery of the 
plan. As detailed in the IDP, engagement with infrastructure providers was 
undertaken during the preparation of this plan to establish infrastructure requirements.  It will be important for developers to work with the council and 
infrastructure providers to understand the infrastructure needs of their developments and routes to delivering the necessary infrastructure.  
 37.7 – Details of historic developer contributions collected and what they were spent 
on can be found in the council’s Infrastructure Funding Statements, published annually.  
  37.8 – The cumulative impact of the policies of this plan on the viability of 
development has been tested. In accordance with national policy, development which complies with the policies of this plan will be assumed to be viable. It would be for applicants to demonstrate that particular circumstances justify the need for 
viability assessment at the planning application stage.

 POLICY 38.  Electr onic communications  
 
A. Proposals for electronic communications infrastructure will be supported 
subject to compliance with other policies of this plan and provided it has 
been demonstrated that there are no reasonable opportunities for sharing a 
site, mast or facility with existing electronic communications infrastructure 
in the area that it would be sited.  
 
B. Proposals for residential and commercial development which are  of a major  
development shall include full fibre broadband infrastructure (or any 
successor technology that emerges) to enable connectivity to wider 
networks  unless this is demonstrated not to be possible . 
 
3
8.1 – The policy provides support for electronic communications infrastructure in 
line with national policy  (see section 10 of the National Planning Policy Framework) . 
 38.2 – Full fibre broadband is important to the economic competitiveness and 
attractiveness (see superfaststaffordshire.co.uk)  of the borough. The growth of 
remote working means this is equally important for residential development as  well 
as business user s. Although the policy applie s to major development, all 
development which creates new dwellings and workspaces will be required to 
include full fibre infrastructure where possible.   
POLICY 39.  Protecting community facilities  
 
Proposals that involve the loss of an existing community facility or the loss of 
a site allocated for such purpose will only be supported where:  
 
 1. There is no longer a local need for the facility and this has been robustly 
evidenced by research and consultation; or  
 
 2.  An equivalent facility in terms of quality is provided to serve the same 
community  and in an accessible location.  
 3
9.1 – The community facilities covered by this policy are public houses, libraries, 
play areas, places of worship, local food shops, community halls and community centres, meeting places, indoor and outdoor sports facilities, and cultural buildings.  
 39.2 – National planning policy supports the retention of and development of 
accessible local services and community facilities, such as local shops, meeting places, sports venues, open space, cultural buildings, public houses and places of worship.  
 39.3 – The Asset of Community Value regime under the Localism Act 2011 provides 
another mechanism by which communities can seek to retain buildings in community use.

 POLICY 40.  Renewable and low carbon energy  
 
A. The policies map identifies areas in which proposal for one or more wind 
turbines and proposals for solar photovoltaic generation will be supported 
in principle provided they are in accordance with the following paragraphs 
of this policy and other policies of this plan.  
 
B. Renewable and low carbon energy infrastructure, excluding proposals for 
one or more wind turbines to which paragraph C applies,  will be supported 
if the following criteria are met : 
 
 1. The impacts are (or can be made) acceptable; and 
 
 2. T he proposal  is, where applicable,  accompanied by decommissioning 
details compliance with which will be conditioned to ensure  restoration of 
the site following cessation of energy production.  
 
C. In assessing  whether impacts are acceptable under paragraph A.1. in areas 
where other renewable energy schemes are in operation the cumulative 
effect of additional  developments of this nature  will be an important 
consideration.  
 
D. In accordance with national policy, proposals for one or more wind turbine s 
will be supported only in areas identified as suitable for wind turbine 
development in this plan or a made neighbourhood plan and for which, 
following consultation, it can be demonstrated that the planning impacts 
identified by the affected local community have been fully addressed and 
the proposal has their backing.  This restriction will not apply to applications 
for the repowering of existing wind farms.  
 
40
.1 –The policies map identifies locations that are in principle suitable for wind and 
solar energy generation development. Solar PV development may also be supported in locations outside of these areas, provided it is in accordance with the policies of this plan. In accordance with national policy, proposals for wind turbines outside of the areas identified on the policies map will only be supported if within an area identified as suitable within a made neighbourhood plan.  
 40.2 – In paragraph B.1. impacts refer  to all impacts on living environments , safety  
and residential amenity and to all types of environmental pollution which will be assessed against Policy 50 (Pollution)  and Policy 32 ( Residential amenity), together 
with impacts on the historic environment which will be assessed against Policy  41 
(Historic environment)  and impacts on landscapes which will be assessed against 
Policy  44 (Landscapes).  Transport impacts assessed against Policy 52 (Transport) 
may also be relevant.  
 40.3 – This policy applies to all types of renewable and low carbon energy 
infrastructure including (amongst others) solar, biomass, anaerobic digestion, energy Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                 Design and infrastructure policies

 storage, carbon capture, hydropower and wind. Detailed guidance on considerations 
applicable to different types of renewable and low carbon energy infrastructure is provided in the government’s online Planning Practice Guidance. Particular technologies may give rise to specific risks, for example impact on water quality, which will require assessment.  Reference should also be made to the government’s 
National Policy Statements for energy infrastructure, where applicable: https://www.gov.uk/gove r
 nment/publications/national -policy -statements -for-energy -
infrastructure   
 40.4 – This policy does not override national Green Belt policy which will be applied 
to proposals for renewable and low carbon energy infrastructure in the Green Belt.  
As pointed out in national guidance, such proposals may constitute inappropriate 
development in the Green Belt.  
 
40.5 – National policy seeks to increase the use and supply of renewable and low 
carbon energy and heat . It states that plans should provide a positive strategy for 
energy from these sources  that maximises the potential for suitable development, 
while ensuring that adverse impacts are addressed satisfactorily.  
 40.6 – The principal sources of renewable energy within Staffordshire are biomass / 
energy crops,  anaerobic digestion, wind and solar. As of 2018, within Stafford 
Borough 20.4MW of renewable energy generation capacity was installed, with the 
largest part of this being photov oltaics. The Staffordshire Climate Change Adaptation 
& Mitigation Report (AECOM, 2020) identifies opportunities for renewable energy within the borough
.

 POLICY 41.  Historic environment  
 
A. National policy and legislation will be applied in the consideration of 
development proposals which have potential to affect the significance of 
heritage assets. 
 
B. Development proposals shall preserve  and where appropriate enhance the 
significance of heritage assets and their settings by being based on an 
understanding of the heritage interest, taking opportunities for sustainable 
re-use and achieving high design quality.  
 
C. All potential loss of or harm  to the significance of a heritage asset, including 
its setting, will require clear justification, taking into account:  
 
 1. Settlement pattern including street patterns, orientation of buildings and 
sites, boundaries and density of development;  
 
 2. The scale, form and massing of buildings and structures;  
 
 3.  Materials, including colours and textures;  
 
 4.  Significant landscape features including open spaces, trees and planted 
boundaries;  
 
 5. Significant views and vistas;  
 
 6.  Locally distinctive arch itectural or historical detail;  
 
 7. The setting of heritage assets;  
 
 8. Archaeological remains and potential;  
 
 9. Traditional permeable building construction; and 
 
 10.The cumulative impact of incremental small -scale changes that may have 
as great an effect on the significance of a heritage asset as a larger scale 
development.  
 
Enabling development  
 
D. Enabling development proposals will only be supported where it is shown 
through evidence that alternative solutions cannot be delivered  and where it 
has been demonstrated that the proposed development is the minimum 
necessary to protect the significance of the heritage asset in accordance 
with national policy .

Historic fabric and detail  
 
E. Development proposals must conserve and protect the significance of  
heritage assets by avoiding unnecessary loss of historic fabric and detail of 
significance. For listed buildings this includes internal features, floor plans 
and spaces.  
 
Mitigating unavoidable loss  
 
F. Where harm to  the significance  of an heritage asset  is unavoidable, 
appropriate mitigation measures will be put into place, including where 
appropriate  archaeological investigation (including a written report) or 
recording. This information should be deposited at the County Record 
Office and be available to th e general public.  
 
4
1.1 – In accordance with national policy this policy sets a positive strategy  
for the conservation and enjoyment of the historic environment.  
 41.2 – Statutory protection for the  historic environment is provided by t he Planning 
(Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and the  Ancient Monuments and 
Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The duties in this legislation will be applied, together with national policy and Policy 41 in determining planning and listed building  
applications.  
 41.3 – The quality of the historic environment and the presence of heritage assets 
contributes to the character, distinctiveness and cultural heritage value of Stafford Borough as well as supporting tourism, recreational and green infras tructure 
objectives. It supports tourism and recreation, such as visitors to the Grade II * listed Ancient High House in Stafford town centre and the Grade I Shugborough Hall with its landscaped estate, to providing attractive leisure walks and routes along the borough’s network of historic canals, all of which are designated as linear Conservation Areas. It also provides a distinctive quality environment for everyday life, including quality spaces  for shops and businesses, attractive high streets and 
parks , as well as the homes of many of the borough’s residents.  
 41.4 – The borough is particularly rich in terms of its rural and agricultural heritage, 
including many surviving historic farmsteads and ‘model farms’ from the late 18
th and 
early 19th centuries,  and historic parkland and estates, such as at Shugborough, 
Trentham, Aqualate and Sandon.  
 41.5 – The Local Plan seeks to preserve, manage and enhance the borough’s 
heritage; this includes specifically identified features as well as the wider historic environment. The unique legacy  of the b orough’s historic environment should inspire 
excellence in design whilst retaining character and local  distinctiveness, and 
contribute to the council’s emphasis on the positive management of change. Known individual  heritage assets are identified in the Staffordshire Historic Environment Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                                      Environment policies

 Record, whilst a number of existing documents analyse particular aspects of the 
heritage significance of Stafford Borough. These include Staffordshire County Council’s Historic Environment Character Assessments, Historic  Character 
Assessments for Stafford and Stone within the Staffordshire Extensive Urban Survey and Conservation Area Appraisals produced by the  borough council.  
 41.6 – Within Stafford Borough there are over 800 entries on the statutory list of 
buildings with special architectural  or historic interest. These range from large 
country houses such as the Grade I Shugborough Hall to more modest  items such 
as mile p osts.  
 41.7 The majority of the listed buildings in the Borough are in good or reasonable 
repair, a number of  buildings are in severe disrepair threatening loss of historic detail 
and fabric. These buildings, conservation areas and scheduled ancient monuments are included in the Historic England Her itage at Risk Register .  
 41.8 – The reuse of historic buildings and fabric is inherently sustainable, reducing 
energy expenditure in the manufacture or sourcing of new construction materials and 
making maximum use of existing embedded energy.  Upgrading thermal performance 
or installing alternative energy sources can usually be accommodated within historic 
buildings, but the need to protect the significance of the heritage asset may mean that non- standard approaches will be required.  
 41.9 – There are 30 Conservation Areas within Stafford Borough designated due to 
their special architectural or  historic interest whose character and appearance it is 
desirable to preserve or enhance.   41.10 – The character or appearance of Conservation Areas can be harmed by the 
introduction of incongruous  layouts or forms of development, altering the 
characteristic pattern of spaces between buildings, or being out of  scale with the 
surroundings. As with all developments the following matters of design are also relevant: hei ght, bulk, shape, massing, proportions, vertical or horizontal emphasis, 
materials and colour.   
 41.11 – A register of historic parks  and gardens is kept by Historic England . 
Currently four within Stafford Borough are on the statutory register: Shugborough  
(Grade I), Trentham Gardens (Grade II*), Sandon Park (Grade II) and the German Military Cemetery  on Cannock Chase (Grade II*).  
 41.12 – Stafford Borough is rich in archaeological remains of many types and 
periods. This precious resource is  finite and easi ly damaged or destroyed. Currently 
there are 43 archaeological sites afforded national statutory  protection as Scheduled 
Ancient Monuments, but not all remains that merit protection are scheduled. The County  Council Historic Environment Record (HER) records over 1,100 sites of 
national, regional and local importance within Stafford Borough and is constantly 
being updated.

 41.13 – Where a proposal seeks to enhance the significance of heritage assets and 
their settings in accordance with paragraph B of the policy, or seeks to deliver other 
heritage benefits, this will be encouraged and may be secured by planning condition or planning obligation. Examples of such measures include:  
 
• Repair, restoration or maintenance of a heritage asset(s) and their setting.  
• Increased public access and improved signage to and from heritage assets.  
• Interpretation panels/historical information and public open days.  
• Production and implementation of up- to-date conservation management plans.  
• Measures for investigation, preservation and display of archaeological remains 
and sites.  
• Provision of local capacity for the storage of, and public access to, archives resulting from archaeological and/or historical investigation.  
• Dissemination of historic environment information for members  of the public , 
education al institutions  and for research, including museum displays for 
popularisation of archaeological discoveries.  
• Sustainability and energy efficiency improvements to historic buildings  where they 
would not result in harm to the special historic and architectural interest of the building and its significance.  
• Public realm improvements , for example, enhancement of historic squares and 
spaces, registered parks and gardens, historic pavement materials, street furniture, removal of street clutter and installation of sympathetic lighting.  
 41.14 – Heritage assets in the borough will be conserved and enhanced by:  
 
• Identifying heritage assets that are considered to be at risk of irreversible harm or 
loss; 
• Encouraging owners to maintain their heritage assets  and providing them with 
relevant advice and guidance ; 
• Where necessary the council will use its statutory powers to serve Urgent  Works 
Notices or Repairs Notices or Compulsory Purchase Orders to arrest the decay of its listed buildings;  
• The use of Article 4 directions for conservation areas where the exercise of permitted development rights would undermine the aims for the historic environment.

 POLICY 42.  Flood risk   
 
A. New development should where possible  be directed to areas of lowest risk, 
giving highest priority to Flood Zone 1.  
 
B. Development proposals in areas at risk of flooding as identified on the latest 
Environment Agency flood risk maps and the c ouncil’s Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment (SFRA) will be permitted provided that:  
 
 1. T he vulnerability of the proposed use is appropriate for the level of flood 
risk on the site; and  
 
 2. T he proposal passes the sequential and exception test (where required) 
as outlined in national policy and guidance.  
 
C. Development proposals within Flood Zone 2 and Flood Zone 3 must be 
appropriately flood resilient and resistant, including providing for  safe 
access and escape routes where required, and ensure that any residual risk 
can be safely managed.  A sequential approach should be taken to locating 
development within the site, siting the most vulne rable parts of the 
development in the lowest flood risk areas . 
 
D. With the exception of the provision of essential infrastructure  that has to be 
there and has passed the e xception test set out in national policy and water -
compatible uses , ‘undeveloped’ Flood Zone 3b will be safeguarded for flood 
management purposes.  
 
E. Developments proposed within Flood Zone s 2, 3a and  3b should include an 
assessment of the impact of climate change using appropriate climate 
change allowances over the lifetime of the development so that future flood 
risk is taken into account with residential and commercial finished floor 
levels 600mm above the 1 in 100 year plus climate change flood level , or 
successor requirements. 
 
4
2.1 – The South Staffordshire Council s Strategic Flood Risk Assessment  Level 1  
(SFRA)  (JBA Consulting, 2019) provides an assessment of flood risk within Stafford 
Borough.  
 
42.2 – In line with national policy and the SFRA , this policy seeks to minimise  flood 
risk in new development.  
 42.3 – Staffordshire County Council is the Lead Local Flood Authority and applicants 
for planning permission should have regard to its information for planners and developers  including its consultation criteria and standing advice:

 42.4 – Requirements for the preparation of flood risk assessments to support 
planning applications are set out in national guidance 
ht tps://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood- risk-assessment- for-planning- applications#when-
you-need- an-assessment  and the Stafford Borough Council Development 
Management Planning Application Validation Guidance and Local Validation Criteria.  
 42.
5 – There  are considerable links between flood risk management and climate 
change adaptation. Regard should be had to the council’s Climate Change Adaption Strategy. Natural flood management will be encouraged to deal with the impacts of 
flooding and provide climate adaptation. 
POLICY 43.  Sustainable drainage  
 
A. New development is required to incorporate sustainable drainage systems 
(SuDS ) in line with national policy and guidance and which meet the 
requirements set out in national standards  and the Staffordshire  SuDS  
guidance . It is expected that:  
 
 1. Developments should aim to achieve greenfield run- off rates and ensure 
that surface water run -off is managed as close to its sources as  is 
possible.   
 
 2. Permeable surfaces should be used to minimise runoff as far as 
practicable. Drainage techniques should be used to reduce pollution, flow 
rates, volumes and frequency of runoff. This is referred to as the SuDS 
‘Management Train ’.  
 
 3. SuDS design should take opportunities to provide  multiple benefits, for 
example landscape enhancement, biodiversity, recreation, amenity, 
leisure and the enhancement of historical features;  
 
 4. Planning applications for phased developme nts should be accompanied 
by a drainage  strategy which takes a strategic approach to drainage 
provision across the entire site and incorporates adequate provi sion for 
SuDS within each phase;  
 
 5. The SuDS management train will be  used to prevent and control 
pollutants ; 
 
 6. SuDS should be designed so  that they are easy to maintain  and 
arrangements for carrying out and funding future mainte nance can be 
secured ; and 
 
 7. Exceedance flows, both within and outside of the site, will be 
appropriately designed to minimise risks to both people and property .

 B. Where  partial or completely pumped drainage system s are provided, the 
design flood level should be determined if the pumps were to fail,  if the 
attenuation storage was full, and if a design storm occurred.  
 
C. An emergency overflow should be provided for piped and storage features 
above the predicted water level arising from a 100- year rainfall event, 
inclusive of climate change and t he loss of permeable surfaces within urban 
areas creating increased runoff (referred to as ‘ urban creep ’). 
 
D. Within catchment s identified in the SFRA as having a high number of sewer 
flooding incidents:  
 
 1. Developments of greenfield sites must ensure that there is no increase in 
surface water flows and volu mes; and 
 
 2. Developments of brownfield sites must seek to reduce surface water 
flows and volumes.  
 
4
3.1 – Sustainable urban drainage systems ( SuDS ) should be implemented as part 
of all new development, in line with the Staffordshire SuDS H andbook  and national 
guidance. This policy implements the recommendations of The South Staffordshire 
Councils Strategic Flood Risk Assessment Level 1 (SFRA) (JBA Consulting, 2019).  
 43.2 – The SuDS management train is explained in the Staffordshire SuDS 
Handbook  and a short definition is provided in the glossary at Appendix 8.  
 43.3 – The c atchment s identified within the SFRA as having a high number of sewer 
flooding incidents are in relation to  the River Penk (south Stafford).  
 
POLICY 44.  Landscapes  
 
A. Development shall conserve and enhance landscape and townscape 
character and their scenic and visual quality, avoiding significant adverse 
landscape or visual impacts.  
 
B. Development proposals must be located and designed to respect scenic 
quality and maintain an area’s distinctive sense of place and reinforce local 
distinctiveness.  
 
C. Proposals which would have lan dscape and visual effects should protect,  
avoid detrimental effects on  and, where appropriate, enhance:  
 
 1. The elements of the landscape that contribute to the local distinctiveness 
of the area (including heritage assets, cultural character and biodiversity);  
 
 2. Surviving historic elements of  the present -day landscape that contribute 
significantly to landscape  character;  and Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                                      Environment policies  
 
 
 
 
 
109                              
↑ Return to contents page  
  
 3. The locally distinctive pattern of landscape elements such as woodland, 
streams, hedgerows,  trees and field boundaries.  
 
D. Tranquil areas which have remained relatively undisturbed from noise and 
are recognised for their recreational and amenity value for this reason will 
be protected from developments which would adversely impact on their 
tranquillity.  
 
4
4.1 – National policy states that planning policies should contribute to enhancing 
the local environment including by recognising the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside. Stafford Borough’s rural landscape is central to the area’s identity 
and is a source of pride for residents.  
 
44.2 – Landscape character is the distinct, recognisable and consistent pattern of 
elements in the landscape that makes one landscape different from another. The elements that contribute to the landscape’s recognisable character can include, for 
example, land uses, habitats, trees and hedges. Landscape character is what makes a place unique and different.  
 44.3 - Townscape is the landscape within the built -up area, including the buildings, 
the relationship between them, the different types of urban open spaces, including green spaces and the relationship between buildings and open spaces.  
 44.4 - In assessing the impact of development on landscape character regard should 
be had to Staffordshire County Council’s Landscape Character Assessment document, ‘Planning for  Landscape Change: Supplementary Planning Guidance to 
the Staffordshire and Stoke- on-Trent Structure Plan  1996- 2011’. 
 44.5 – The council’s planning application validation criteria set out the categories of 
planning applications that will need to be supported by a Landscape and Visual 
Impact Assessment to demonstrate compliance with this policy . 
 
POLICY 45.  Cannock Chase A rea of Outstanding Natural Beauty (A ONB) 
 
A. Great weight will be given to conserving and enhancing the landscape and 
scenic beauty of the Cannock Chase AONB. D evelopment proposals  that 
impact on the AONB  must comply with national policy and shall : 
 
 1. Conserve and enhance the special landscape character, heritage and 
distinctiveness of the AONB; and 
 
 2. Conserve and enhance important viewpoints  to protect the context and

of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Additional guidance is provided in the AONB Management P lan and by the Cannock Chase AONB Views and Setting 
Guidance (LUC, 2020).  Cannock Chase AONB occupies a significant part of the 
south- east of the borough. It is important to note that development outside of the 
AONB but within its setting may impact on its landscape and scenic beauty.  
 
POLICY 46.  Green and blue infrastructure  network  
 
A. The existing green and blue infrastructure network in Stafford Borough will 
be protected, enhanced and extended. New development proposals shall, 
where appropriate to their nature and scale, contribute to, or enhance, the 
connected and functional network of habitat, open spaces and waterscapes 
by: 
 
 1. Creating and improving connectivity  for people and nature  by providing

 2. New or enhanced green infrastructure is designed and integrated into the 
development scheme where appropriate, including natural greenspace, 
woodland and street trees;  
 
 3. The scheme integrates into existing and proposed cycling, bridleway and 
walking routes by providing new connecting links where opportunities 
exist;  
 
 4. The protection and enhancement of biodiversity and ecological links.  
 
C. Residential developments of 10 or more dwellings will be required to 
contribut e towards extending the green network by providing onsite 
publicly accessible open space and/or contributions to offsite open space 
provision, together with contributions to ongoing maintenance, to meet a 
standard of 32m2 of open space per person, comprised of:  
 
 1. 20m2 accessible natural green space per person; and  
 
 2. 8m2 equipped play space per person; and  
 
 3 4m2 informal sport space per person  
 
D. Play space should be provided as follows (definitions of the different types 
of play spaces are provided in  Appendix 3):  
 
 1. Developments of 10- 50 homes: contribution to offsite play spaces  unless 
no other facilities exist locally (within a 10-minute  walk of the site)  then 
on-site locally equipped play space ; 
 
 2. Developments of 51 – 499 homes: on- site locally equipped play space ; 
 
 3. Developments of 500 -999 homes: on -site neighbourhood play space ; 
 
 4. Developments of 1000 homes: on -site destination play space.  
 
E. Accessible natural green space should be provided on site. Where it is 
demonstrated that a useable area of onsite accessible natural green space 
cannot be provided an offsite open space contribution calculated in 
accordance with Appendix 3 will be sought.  
 
F. Developments will be required to contribute towards sport facilities 
necessary to mitigat e demand, which will be calculated using the Sport 
England calculator, as follows:

6.1 – The green and blue infrastructure network  (GBN) is a network of multi -
functional green and blue (water -based)  spaces  capable of delivering a wide range 
of environmental and quality of life benefits for local communities.  The Strategic 
Green Infrastructure Network is identified on the policies map and i dentifies GBN of 
particular importance at a strategic level.  
 46.2 – The GBN provides areas for recreation and education, habitats for wildlife and 
also provides environmental services such as flood defence and absorption of air pollution. The GBN makes an  important contribution to health and wellbeing. It also 
provides the opportunity to adapt to and mitigate for climate change, for example helping with surface water flooding, reducing the urban heat island effect, and lowering the energy demands of buildi ngs. It can also provide nature- based solutions 
to climate change adaptation.   
 46.3 – New developments should use the environmental features of sites as the 
foundation of their design. The council will work with its partners to plan and enhance strategic green infrastructure links between places and habitat across the borough. The impact of  new development on green/blue infrastructure assets will be assessed 
as part of determining planning applications. This process will seek to retain green and blue assets in development proposal and the incorporation of new green 
infrastructure.  
 46.4 – Green infrastructure provision should support  the aims and objectives of the 
Nature Recovery Network and the Local Nature Recovery Strategy and be in line with the mitigation hierarchy detailed in Policy 47.  
 46.5 – National policy states that plans shoul d aim to create places that support 
healthy lifestyles including through the provision of safe and accessible green infrastructure (defined to include green and blue spaces) and sports facilities. A 
positive approach should be taken to the provision of open space.  
 46.6 – Policy 4 6, which should be read together with Appendix 3, supports these 
objectives by setting out the requirements for new development to contribute to improving and extending green and blue infrastructure.  
 46.7 – Specific requirements for on- site provision of natural green space and play 
spaces within new housing development are identified in the policy and set out in more detail in Appendix 3.

↑ Return to contents page  
 46.8 – Requirements for contributions and/or on- site provision of playing pitches will 
be calculated in accordance with the Sport England calculator available on the 
council’s website and are informed by the latest Playing Pitch Strategy.  
 
46.9 – The design of new onsite open spaces should accord with Policies 34 (Urban 
design), 36 (Landscaping  design), and 43 (Sustainable drainage).   
 46.10 – Where a design and access statement is required, this shall be used to 
demonstrate that the requirements of part A of the policy have been met, including that opportunities for street trees, gr een roofs etc. have been maximised.
 
POLICY 47.  Biodiversity  
 
A. In accordance with national policy  and legislation, planning permission will 
be refused for development that results in significant harm to biodiversity 
that cannot be avoided (by locating elsewhere), adequately mitigated , or (as 
last resort) compensated for.  
 
B. Within the context of the mitigation hierarchy set out in paragraph A and 
subject to the specific requirements applicable to designated sites as 
detailed below, all development shall, unless it is in a category of 
development that is exempted by the Environment Act 2021 or regulation 
made thereunder from the requirement to deliver biodiversity net gain,  
achieve biodiversity net gain  of at least 10% as defined in national policy, 
guidance and legisla tion, secured in perpetuity (at least 30 years) in 
accordance with the following requirements:  
 
 1. The latest DEFRA metric or agreed equivalent is used to quantify the 
baseline and post -development biodiversity value of the development site 
and off -site areas proposed for habitat creation;  
 
 2. The assessment is undertaken by a suitably qualified and experienced 
ecologist and is submitted together with baseline and proposed habitat 
mapping with the application;  
 
 3. A 30 -year management plan is submitted with the application detailing 
how the post -development biodiversity values of the site and any 
supporting off -site mitigation will be achieved; and  
 
 4. Any off -site habitat creation/restoration is located in accordance with 
Stafford Borough’s Nature Recov ery Network and Local Nature Recovery 
Strategy.  
 
C. Where development is approved which has potential to impact upon 
biodiversity , developers will be required to:

  1. Minimise disturbance to and protect and enhance the site’s ecological 
value (unless compens ation is justified in accordance with the mitigation 
hierarchy) ; 
 
 2. Put appropriate future management arrangements in place;  and 
 
 3. Design appropriate mitigation measures into the proposal.  
 
European Sites  
 
D. Proposals that have a likely significant effect on European sites will be 
subject to an appropriate assessment in accordance with the Habitats 
Regulations. Where the assessment indicates that it is not possible to 
ascertain that the proposal, either on its own or in combination with other 
plans or projects, would have no adverse effect on the integrity of the site, 
development will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances where 
there are no alternative solutions, there is an imperative over -riding public 
interest and compensation  measures are secured.  
 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest  
 
E. Development  likely (either on its own or in combination with other 
development) to adversely affect a Site of Special Scientific Interest will not 
be permitted unless the benefits of  the development clearly outweigh both 
its likely impact on the features of the site that make it of special scientific 
interest, and any broader impacts on the national network of Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest .  
 
Sites of  local importance  
 
F. Development likely to have an adverse effect (either directly or indirectly) on 
a Local Nature Reserve, a Site of Biological Importance , a Biodiversity Alert 
Site, a Local Geological Site, or a natural watercourse, lake, reservoir, canal 
or groundwater area (including Water Framework Directive protected areas 
as listed in the Humber and Severn River Basin Management Plans) will only 
be permitted where : 
 
 1. It can be clearly demonstrated that there are reasons for the proposal that 
outweigh the need to  safeguard the special ecological / geological 
interest of the site; and  
 
 2.  It has been demonstrated, where development would result in significant 
harm, that it cannot be rea sonably located on an alternative site that 
would result in less or no harm; and  
 
 3. harm can be prevented, minimised, adequately mitigated o r compensated 
for. Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                                      Environment policies

47.1 – The planning system has an important part to play in meeting the UK’s 
national and international commitments for habitats and species. Local authority 
planning is the key mechanism for determining the location, scale and nature of development and ensuring biodiversity is integrated into planning policies.  This 
policy is structur ed around and distinguishes between the hierarchy of international, 
national and locally designated sites.  At the top of that hierarchy are European sites. 
‘European sites’ are those that have the highest level of protection in the UK through legislation. These include Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSAC), Special Protection Areas (SPA), proposed  
Special Protection Areas (pSPA), European Offshore Marine Sites, and Ramsar sites. It should be noted t hat impacts on European Sites can occur at some distance 
away. Therefore, an assessment of impacts for European Sites outside the borough 
may be required for some developments.  
 47.2 – Within Stafford borough there are the following European sites:  
 ●  Cannock Chase SAC  
●  Chartley Moss (under the West Midlands Meres and Mosses SAC)  
●  Pasturefields Salt Marsh SAC  
●  Cop Mere (under Midland Meres and Mosses Phase II Ramsar designation)  
●  Aqualate Mere (under Midland Meres and Mosses Phase II Ramsar designation)  
 47.3 – The following European Site is on the edge of the Borough:  
 ●  Mottey Meadows SAC  
 47.4 – The Environment Act 2021 amends the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 
to make the grant of planning permission conditional on the achievement of 10% 
biodiversity net gain on the pre- development biodiversity value of the site. This gain 
is to be achieved on site , through registered offsite gains , or through the purchase of 
credits.  47.5 – Biodiversity gain is calculated using the DEFRA Biodiversity Metric. The 
Planning Practice Guidance provides a more detailed explanation of the biodiversity net gain calculation process.  Biodiversity net gain will be secured by planning 
obligation or condition.  
 47.6 – The Stafford Borough Nature Recovery Network Mapping Report 
(Staffordshire Wildlife Trust, 2019) identifies key locations  where habitats may be 
created or enhanced to contribute to nature’s recovery. This will be used with the biodiversity  metric to assess the quality of existing habitats. It can also be used to 
identify areas for future improvements.  
 47.7 – As highlighted in policies 14 and 15 , the Countryside Enhancement Areas 
planned in Stafford and Stone provide opportunities for off -site biodiversity gain to be Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                                      Environment policies

 achieved in these areas  as part of a strategic approach to maintaining and 
enhancing networks of habitats and green infrastructure .    
 
POLICY 48.  Cannock Chase S pecial Area of C onservation (SAC)  
 
A. To ensure the Cannock Chase SAC is not harmed, development that is 
deemed to have an impact as set out within the Planning Evidence Based 
Report (PEBR)  produced by the SAC Partnership will not be permitted within 
400m of the SAC.  
 
B. To ensure the Cannock Chase SAC is not harmed, all development that 
leads to a net increase in dwellings within 15km of the SAC,  as shown on 
the policies m ap, must take necessary steps to avoid or mitigate any 
adverse effects upon the SAC ’s integrity. This may include contributions to 
habitat management; access management and visitor infrastructure; 
publicity, education and awareness raising; provision of additional 
recreation space; and measures to encourage sustainable travel.  
 
C. The effective avoidance and / or  mitigation of any identified adverse effects 
must be demonstrated to the council as the Competent Authority, and 
secured by means of a suitable mechanism (e.g. legal agreement) prior to 
approval of the development.  
 
4
8.1 – This policy applies  to Cannock Chase Special Area of Conservation. 
 
48.2 – Stafford Borough Council has worked jointly with Staffordshire County 
Council, Cannock Chase District  Council, Lichfield District Council and South 
Staffordshire District Council, Wolverhampton City C ouncil and Walsall  Metropolitan 
Borough Council  to establish strategic approaches to mitigation for Cannock Chase 
SAC.  
 48.3 – The HRA  outline s possible negative impacts on Cannock Chase SAC from 
the following sources:  
 ●  Water abstraction  
●  Nitrogen deposition  
●  Air quality  
●  Recreation  
 48.4 – A partnership w as set up to carry out further work and establish suitable 
mitigation measures and implementation  to address possible negative impacts. This 
work defines where mitigation measures  should be considered around the Cannock 
Chase SAC. Further evidence- based  studies are progressing to consider the 
implications of nitrogen deposition and ammonia on the SACs and Ramsars within and adjacent to Stafford Borough.

 48.5 – Depending on the nature of a proposal, some planning applications may be  
required to provide information relating to the possible negative impacts highlighted 
above. Where there are likely significant effects identified for any European Sites, 
development will be refused unless adverse effects on integrity, alone or in-combination can be ruled out at project level appropriate assessment. Stafford Borough Council has produced guidance to mitigate the impact of new residential 
development together with a Frequently Asked Q uestions document .  This can be 
viewed on the council’s website via the following link: 
https://www.staffordbc.gov.uk/cannock -chase- special -area- of-conservation-sac     
 48.6 – The SAC P artnership has prod uced The Cannock Chase Special Area of 
Conservation (SAC) Strategic Management and Monitoring Measures / Detailed 
Implementatio n Plans. These plans set out a means to provide for recreational use in 
the future at Cannock Chase (across the AONB) without compromising the nature conservation, archaeological, geological and historic interest of the site of the site.  
 48.7 – The SAC Partnership has  also produced a Planning Evidence Based Report 
(PEBR). This reviews the predicted impact of  new residential  developments  in a 
defined area on the Cannock Chase SAC and apportions contributions for financing 
the mitigations measures per local authority within the SAC .  
 
POLICY 49.  Trees 
 
A. New developments shall retain , integrate and minimise the risk of harm to 
trees of value, hedgerows and woodlands which are protected and/or which 
contribut e to the character and amenities of the area or to ecology.  
  
B. Development wi ll not be permitted that would directly or indirectly damage  
or restrict the longevity of  ancient woodland, ancient or veteran trees or 
ancient or species- rich hedgerows  unless there are wholly exceptional 
reasons  and a suitable compensation strategy exists . 
 
C. Where the benefits of the proposed development outweigh the harm 
resulting from the loss of trees and hedgerows , adequate replacement 
provision will be required, including an ongoing management plan. 
 
D. New tree planting schemes  should specify mixed native species and 
monoculture planting should be avoided.  
 4
9.1 – Trees can be found in almost all ecosystems across the Borough of Stafford. 
Trees of value (in paragraph A of the policy) refers to category A and B trees  as 
defined within BS 5837 “Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction” . 
Category A trees are trees of high quality and value capable of making a significant contribution to the area for 40 or more years. Category B trees are trees of moderate quality or value capable of making a significant contribution to the area for 20 or more years. In rural areas, woodland, orchards hedgerows and mature trees provide 
habitats for a range of species, ensuring the survival of local wildlife. Similarly, trees Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                                      Environment policies

 in the urban area provide space for urban wildlife, ensuring that biodiversity levels in 
urban environments are somewhat maintained. B ecause trees are an important 
wildlife habitat, b y protecting t hem, local wildlife is  also protected. 
 49.2 – There are a number of issues associated with climate change that tree 
planting provides a solution to. For example, trees remove carbon from the earth’s atmosphere, increasing air quality and reducing greenhouse gas levels. Furthermore, when planted in urban environments, trees increase urban cooling, preventing the formation of urban heat islands.  
 49.3 – This policy seeks to retain or ensure the replacement of existing trees , 
hedgerows and woodlands of value within the borough.  
 
POLICY 50.  Pollution 
 
A. Development shall not cause or be affected by unacceptable harm to human 
health, living conditions, or the natural environment through air  (including 
odour) , water, noise  or light pollution, vibration, insects or vermin, or land 
contamination or instability.  
 
B. Proposals which are likely to  cause pollution or result in exposure to 
sources  of pollution or risk to safety  will only be permitted if measures can 
be implemented to minimise pollution and risk to a level that provides a high 
standard of protection for health, environmental quality  and amenity.  
 50
.1 – This policy gives local effect to national policy on ensuring that the effects of 
development on health, living conditions and the natural environment are acceptable. The policy should be read alongside Policy 32 which protect s the  residential amenity 
of existing and future occupiers.  
 50.2 – In applying this policy the ‘agent of change principle’ set out in national policy 
will be applied. This means that where the operation of an existing business (including farming businesses) or community facility could have a significant adverse 
effect on new development (including changes of use) in its vicinity, the developer for 
the new development will be required to provide suitable mitigation before the development has been completed.  
 50.3 – Requirements for the preparation of land contamination assessments, noise 
and vibration assessments,  and lighting assessments (in relation to external lights) to 
support planning applications are set out in the Stafford Borough Council Development Management Planning Application Validation Guidance and Local Validation Criteria.

 POLICY 51.  Air quality  
 
A. Development shall not lead to a further deterioration of existing areas of 
poor air quality, cause the exceedance of limit values, or expose future 
residents or users of  the development to unacceptable levels of air quality.  
 
B. Development should make a pos itive contribution to air quality 
improvements where this is possible.  
 
C. Where it is identified that a development proposal could be at risk from 
exposure to unacceptable levels of air pollution or could contribute to air 
pollution problems elsewhere, the f ollowing measures may be sought:  
 
 1. Design measures such as altering the siting, orientation and/or massing 
of buildings to avoid trapping air pollution roadside by creating canyons; 
locating habitable accommodation away from busy roads; requiring 
habita ble room windows  which face onto a busy road with the potential 
for air quality problems  to be non- openable and alternative means of 
ventilation to be provided; requiring the creation landscape buffers 
between air pollution sources and receptors; ensuring point sources of 
air pollution are suitably ventilated away from receptors.  
 
 2.  Reduction measures such as the provision of new and additional on- site 
electric vehicle charging points and car club spaces; enhancements to 
bicycle infrastructure; enhanced walking routes, site travel plans; the 
planting of street trees.  
 
5
1.1 – This policy gives effect to national policy and guidance on the role of the 
planning system in addressing air quality problems.  
 51.2 – Air pollution  limit values are set out in The Air Quality (Standards) Regulations 
2010 or any updated or any replacement standards that may be brought into effect . 
 51.3 – Areas at risk of non-compliance with  limit values can be identified by viewing 
the late st Stafford Borough Council Air Quality Annual Status Report.  
  51.4 – There are currently no Air Quality Management Areas  (AQMA)  designated in 
Stafford Borough and this policy seeks to ensure that the need to identify such areas is avoided.  The impact of development on areas of poor air quality in neighbouring 
districts, including the Stoke on Trent AQMA, will need to be considered.  
 51.5 – Requirements for the preparation of air quality assessments to support 
planning applications are set out in the Stafford Borough Council Development Management Planning Application Validation Guidance and Local Validation Criteria.  
 51.6 – Policy 48 considers the linked issue of nitrogen deposition impacts on Special 
Area s of Conservation.

 POLICY 52.  Transport  
 
A. Proposed development shall:  
 
 1. Be located and designed to minimise the need to travel;  
 
 2. Prioritise sustainable travel by providing and where appropria te 
facilitating  the upgrade of  convenient and safe conne ctions to and 
infrastructure for  walking  (including wheelchair users, mobility scooters 
and pushchairs), cycling and the use of  public transport;  
 
 3 Consider the impact of development on the wider transport network and 
contribute to meeting the wider strategic transport infrastructure needs 
generated by the impact of development in the area;  
 
 4. Mitigate the environmental impacts of transport, including impacts on air 
quality, noise pollution and landscape character;  
 
 5. Protect, and where possible enhance, public rights of way  and access ; 
 
 6. Provide safe and suitable  access for all potential users;  
 
 7. Not cause unacceptable highway safety issues ; and  
 
 8.  Avoid severe residual cumulative impacts on the road network.  
 
B. Points of access and on-site layouts should be designed in accordance  with 
Manual for Streets to pri oritise walking and cycling.  
 
5
2.1 – This policy gives local effect to national planning policy. Not all paragraphs of 
this policy will be applicable to every  type of development. For example, much of the 
policy will not usually appl y to householder  developments.  
 52.2 – Connections to and upgrades to the walking and cycling network should 
where possible contribute to implementation of the Staffordshire Local Walking and Cycling Infrastructure Plan.  52.3 – Development proposals should have regard to the Staffordshire 
Local Transport Plan and the Stafford Borough Integrated Transport Strategy and 
any subsequent revisions  to these documents .  
 52.4 – Planning applications for developments that generate significant amounts of  
transport movement will, in accordance with national policy and guidance, be 
required to be supported by a travel plan and transport statement  / assessment.

(AECOM, 2020) highlights that road transport is the biggest source of greenhouse 
gas emissions in Stafford Borough, accounting for 43% of the borough’s emissions.  
This emphasises the need to decarbonise transport by increasing active travel and public transport use and moving to low  or zero emission vehicles.  
 52.6 – On site layouts should consider street naming and numbering, including 
where later phases of development are proposed.  
POLICY 53.  Parking standards  
 
A. Car and bicycle parking shall be provided in accordance with the standards 
set out in Appendix 4.  
 
B. Levels of car (but not bicycle) parking provision below the levels set out in 
the standards  in Appendix 4  will be accepted where this is clearly justified 
having regard to: 
 
 1. The quality of the site’s accessibility by walking, cycling and public 
transport; and/or  
 
 2. The measures both on -site and off -site that are proposed to improve 
accessibility by non -car modes; and/or  
 
 3. The content of a travel p lan, in particular t he targets, measures and the 
parking management regime; and/or  
 
 4. The predicted traffic generation;  and/or  
 
 5. The ability of a mixed -use development to share parking space s due to 
operational arrangements of the different land uses; and/or  
 
 6. The sco pe for the development to use existing and conveniently available 
public car parking supply in off -peak periods.  
 5
3.1 – Parking standards  are set in accordance with national planning policy and 
reflect  also the need to ensure an adequate provision of spaces for charging plug- in 
and other ultra- low emission vehicles.   
 53.2 – The parking standards seek to support government policy including  that 
contained in the Transport Decarbonisation Plan (2021) by requiring adequate cycle 
parking.  
 53.3 – On 15 June 2022 changes were made to the Building Regulations Part S to 
require the installation of electric vehicle charging points in new residential  and non-
residential  buildings  and on major renovations. Details of the requirements can be 
found here:  Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                                     Connections policies

 Appendix 3: Open space standards for new development  
 
Play Spaces defined  
 Destination Play Spaces: these are the largest play spaces within the borough and 
are often part of a larger ‘park’ setting. These are integrated and multifunctional place space with minimum facilities to include toddler play, junior play, dynamic/teenager play, MUGA and wheeled sport. These spaces are designed to provide opportunities for all age ranges to experience play opportunities together via a range of play experiences. Examples of these spaces are Victoria Park  and 
Wildwood Park in Stafford  and Westbridge Park  in Stone.  
 
Neighbourhood play Spaces: Whilst these areas are smaller than the Destination 
Play Spaces, they offer a wide range of equipment, that encourages climbing, 
balancing, sliding, swings and social play opportunities for all ages. Examples of these spaces are Charnley Road and Holmcroft  Road in Stafford.  
 Local Play Spaces: These are the smallest play spaces within the borough and are 
generally designed, but not always, for younger children to play close to where they live. Whilst our smallest play areas, the equipment should still provide for a range of movement and play experiences. Examples of these play areas are Barnes Road in 
Stafford  and Copeland Drive in Stone.  
 Open space calculations  
 The open space requirement is 32m
2 per person. In order to calculate the open 
space required by  a development the following calculation is done:  
Number of houses x 2.33 (average housing occupancy) x 32m2 = total amount of 
open space.    The same calculation is used to calculate off site contributions.  
  Stafford Borough Local Plan 2020- 2040                                                      A ppendices

 Appendix 4: Parking standards  
 
Design of cycle parking  
 
The preferred and simplest form of cycle parking is  that of a Sheffield stand. Stands 
should be no more than 0.75m high (to the top of the rail) and 0.6 to 1m long. Cycle parking stands should be at least 0.6m from adjacent walls and kerbs to allow for the overhang of the wheels, and require at least 1m clear space in front to allow for bikes 
to be wheeled into the stand. Stands should be at least 0.8m apart (1m preferable for ease of use) to allow adequate space for both sides of the stand to be occupied. Short -stay cycle parking should be close to entrances in locations with higher footfall 
to increase security. Longer -stay cycle parking should be covered. The location of 
cycle parking within buildings should be easily accessible, step free and with enough space to turn the cycle when going in and out. Residential  bicycle parking should be 
secure and covered.  Where residential parking is provided in a private garage, 
additional space should be provided in the dimensions of the garage to accommodate bicycle storage.  
 Electric vehicle charging points  
 Electric vehic le charging points shall be provided in accordance with the 
requirements of the Building Regulations.  
 Standards by use class  
 The car parking standards detailed below should generally be taken as a requirement. However,  in determining planning applications the borough c ouncil will 
judge the individual circumstances of each proposed development  in assessing the 
specific parking needs. For example, a proposal to change the use of an existing building on a restricted site may not be able to meet the standard for the new use. 
Even in these cases, it will be a basic requirement that no traffic hazard or nuisance should be caused. Any under or over provision of parking will need to be justified by clear and justifiable  evidence.

 Historic environment : All aspects of the environment resulting from the interac tion 
between people and places through time, including all surviving physical remains of past human activity, whether visible, buried or submerged, and landscaped and planted or managed flora.  
 Local Green Space: Local Green Space designation is a way to provide special 
protection against development for green areas of particular importance to local 
communities. Local Green Space is afforded the same level of protection as Green 
Belt. 
 Local Nature Reserve (LNR) : Statutory protected sites designated under S ection 
21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949.

hectare or more, or as otherwise provided in the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.  
 Material consideration : A material planning consideration is one which is relevant 
to the consideration of an application for planning permission. A wide range of things can be material considerations. However, as planning is concerned with the public interest the protection of purely private interests such as the impact of a development on the value of a neighbouring property or loss of private rights to light 
are not material considerations.  
 Non-designated heritage asset : Non-designated heritage assets are locally 
identified buildings, monuments, sites, places, areas or landscapes identified by the local plan making body as having a degree of heritage significance meriting consideration in planning decisions, but which do not meet the criteria for designated heritage assets.
