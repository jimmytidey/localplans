South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 20207What is the Local Plan for?
1.1 Planning has a key role in enabling us to meet the challenges that the district 
faces whilst protecting what we value about the district, and also builds on 
opportunities to make it an even better place.
1.2 The Local Plan sets out how development will be planned and delivered across 
South Oxfordshire to 2035. It sets out a vision, shows how we have developed 
a strategy which responds to that vision and how it will be delivered working 
in partnership with everyone with a stake in the future of the district. It also 
includes policies that are used when we are determining planning applications. 
1.3 The Local Plan sets out policies for change and includes a strategy for 
delivering growth from 2011 to 2035. It identifies appropriate areas and sites 
for development, such as new homes, offices, shops and community facilities. 
It sets out how valuable historic and natural environments will be protected 
and enhanced. The policies in this Plan will be used to help make decisions on 
planning applications in the district. 
1.4 In preparing this plan we have:
• Explored how much land is likely to be needed for different uses;
• Identified the right areas and sites to make sure that we have a healthy 
supply of developable land;
• Worked with our neighbouring councils and Oxfordshire County Council, 
expert advisors (such as the Environment Agency and Natural England) 
and infrastructure providers (such as Thames Water) to look at how 
the impacts of development and growth can be managed across South 
Oxfordshire and beyond;
• Supported parish and town councils who are working on community-led 
plans and Neighbourhood Development Plans so that they have had their 
say on how their local area is shaped; and
• Listened to our residents, businesses and communities.INTRODUCTION

development of 
the district, in 
strategic terms, 
over the length of 
the plan period
What is in the Local Plan?
1.5 The Plan guides development of the district, in strategic terms, over the length 
of the plan period. It provides the basis for growth, through setting out the 
distribution of new housing, employment and retail development and it also 
provides the framework for protecting the district’s important natural and built 
environment.
1.6 The Plan covers the whole of South Oxfordshire, and the Council has worked 
and will continue to work with our neighbours to plan for cross-boundary 
issues, such as how to accommodate the unmet housing needs of Oxford and 
where new strategic transport and utilities infrastructure are needed.
1.7 Whilst the Local Plan provides the broad strategic framework for growth, much 
of the detail, such as some of the specific non-strategic sites to be allocated 
for housing, will be finalised at the local level, through Neighbourhood 
Development Plans (NDPs).
Why we have prepared a Local Plan
1.8 In April 2014, the councils across Oxfordshire published a Strategic Housing 
Market Assessment (SHMA), and this identified that South Oxfordshire 
needed additional housing beyond that which was planned for in the South 
Oxfordshire Core Strategy.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202091.9 As well as this, Oxford City Council indicated that they would have difficulties 
in meeting their identified housing need entirely within the city boundary and 
that other districts across the county could be asked to consider taking some of 
this “unmet housing need”.
1.10 In response the Council decided to review the existing plan and consider how 
to plan for additional growth in the most advantageous and positive way.
1.11 By preparing this Local Plan the Council has helped ensure that it can plan for 
where, how and when new development takes place, and that it can plan for 
all needs in the best way.

South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020The Development Plan
1.12 The South Oxfordshire Development Plan is the starting point in making 
decisions on planning applications. All planning applications will be determined 
in accordance with the “Development Plan” unless material considerations 
indicate otherwise. The Development Plan comprises:
• The Local Plan 2035;
• “Made” (adopted) Neighbourhood Development Plans prepared by local 
communities; and
• Any Development Planning Documents relating to minerals and waste 
prepared by Oxfordshire County Council.
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202011Neighbourhood Development Plans
1.13 In South Oxfordshire, Neighbourhood Development Plans can be prepared 
by either town or parish councils, or a neighbourhood forum. Once “made” 
(adopted) they form part of the Development Plan. They set out in more detail 
how a community wishes to see its area develop. Where Neighbourhood 
Development Plans are prepared, they must be in general conformity with the 
Local Plan.
1.14 South Oxfordshire District Council will continue to support communities 
who wish to prepare Neighbourhood Development Plans. Details of how the 
Council can help with the preparation of Neighbourhood Development Plans 
are set out on the Council’s website.

How the Plan was prepared
1.15 The Local Plan preparation process started in 2014 and the Plan was 
adopted in December 2020. The Local Plan has been prepared and 
supported by an evidence base, it has been the subject of numerous public 
consultations.12

Studies which set out requirements – these 
provide evidence of the level of need we 
should plan for, including for housing, 
employment, shopping and leisure.
Studies which look at the suitability of sites 
and places for development – these provide 
information about which places might be 
most appropriate for development.Studies which look at the impacts of 
development – these provide information 
about how development will affect roads, 
water supply and so on, and what might need 
to be done to deal with these impacts.
Public consultation – this Plan has been 
through several stages of public consultation 
and a public examination before it was adopted 
as the Development Plan for the district.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202013
VISION AND OBJECTIVES
2.1 South Oxfordshire is a beautiful and prosperous place with many strengths: 
its natural environment, picturesque towns and villages, and a buoyant 
and successful economy. There are challenges in ensuring that we plan for 
development in a way that protects and enhances all that is special about our 
district. In our vision for 2035 we set out how we see the district evolving 
whilst building on our strengths.
 
2.2 A set of strategic objectives define what the Local Plan 2035 focuses on to 
deliver our stated vision. Our strategy is an evolution of that developed for the 
Core Strategy 2012, as we believe it is still appropriate and sustainable, and it 
reflects valued input from the community.
Our Vision for 2035
South Oxfordshire will remain a beautiful and prosperous place to live. 
It will be an attractive place for people to work and spend their leisure 
time.
2.3 By meeting our housing and employment needs and the creation of new, 
sustainable and vibrant places, we will have provided enough homes and jobs 
for those wishing to live and work within South Oxfordshire. New development 
will meet the highest standards of design with necessary associated 
infrastructure.
2.4 We have continued to support development at the Towns and Larger Villages. 
Growth will support employment opportunities and deliver regeneration and 
infrastructure with a focus on delivering housing and employment at Science 
Vale1. We will also allocate new development at strategic locations.
 
2.5 Science Vale will continue to grow as a world-renowned science, research and 
innovation led hub that attracts business, creates job opportunities, and delivers 
housing growth. Roads and rail links will have been improved and pedestrian and 
cycle networks will have made it easier for people to get around, in particular to 
major employment sites. Didcot will be a flourishing Garden Town, being both 
the gateway to and the heart of Science Vale. 2
1 Science Vale is an area in 
Southern Oxfordshire, crossing 
the border of South Oxfordshire 
and the Vale of White Horse. 
It is one of the most successful 
science clusters in the UK. This 
activity is concentrated around 
the three centres for science and 
technology at Harwell Campus, 
Culham Science Centre, and 
Milton Park, but is supported 
by a number of important 
settlements including Didcot, 
Wantage and Grove.
13South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035   PUBLICATION VERSION14
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 20202.6 Through careful management of the Oxford Green Belt we will have made 
provision towards Oxford City’s unmet housing needs whilst protecting the 
important setting of Oxford and also making appropriate provision for housing, 
business growth and urban and rural regeneration. The North Wessex Downs 
and Chilterns Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty will be protected and 
enhanced, whilst also allowing for appropriate and sustainable growth in 
places. Our rich and varied history is celebrated, protected and enhanced for 
the benefit of residents and visitors. 
2.7 We will plan for new development at seven strategic locations; Chalgrove, 
Culham, Berinsfield, Grenoble Road, Northfield, North of Bayswater Brook and 
Wheatley. We will exceed expectations in terms of healthy living, sustainable 
travel and the design of buildings, homes and public spaces. Everyone will have 
access to high quality leisure, retail and cultural facilities which will also attract 
visitors. South Oxfordshire will continue to be a tourist destination, helping our 
towns and villages to remain vibrant and prosperous. Communities will thrive, 
and through neighbourhood planning and community engagement, will have 
their say on how their local area is shaped. The North 
Wessex Downs 
and Chilterns 
Areas of 
Outstanding 
Natural Beauty 
will be protected 
and enhanced
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202015152.8 The impacts of COVID-19 on the economy and lifestyle were emerging 
during the examination of this plan. The Plan provides new homes, jobs and 
infrastructure to meet needs. South Oxfordshire is an area of traditionally 
high demand and it is reasonable to assume that this will remain the case 
throughout the plan period. Science Vale and the Ox-Cam Arc is an area which 
is likely to be important for the country’s recovery. The Plan contains sufficient 
flexibility (for example in its employment policies) to provide an appropriate 
framework for changing lifestyles and needs. If development needs prove 
slower in coming forward, or change, this will be monitored (see Chapter 11 of 
the Plan). The Plan can be reviewed if necessary.
Strategic Objectives
2.9 There are a series of objectives which underpin the Local Plan, which should 
not be viewed in isolation, but rather should be considered as a full suite of 
objectives. A balance needs to be struck between the core pillars of sustainable 
development, including the protection of the environment and the need to 
provide sufficient development to meet the needs of the existing and future 
population. 
Objective 1 - Settlements 
OBJ 1.1  Support the settlement hierarchy, the growth and development of Didcot 
Garden Town, the delivery of new development in the district, the growth 
of our market towns and the vitality of our villages. 
OBJ 1.2 Support rural communities and their ‘way of life’, recognising that this is 
what attracts people to the district.
OBJ 1.3 Meet identified housing needs by delivering high-quality, sustainable, 
attractive places for people to live and work.
OBJ 1.4 Focus growth in Science Vale through delivering homes and jobs, retail 
and leisure facilities and enhanced transport infrastructure.
Objective 2 - Housing 
OBJ 2.1  Deliver a wide range of housing options to cater for the housing needs of 
our community (including self-build and older persons’ accommodation).
OBJ 2.2 Support the regeneration of housing and facilities to strengthen 
communities and address deprivation issues.16
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020OBJ 2.3 Support meeting the economic and housing needs of the county as a 
whole, reflecting the special character of South Oxfordshire.

will provide high quality local jobs to help retain more skilled residents in 
the local workforce. 
OBJ 3.2 Aim to reduce commuting distances by supporting business growth in 
locations close to existing business areas, transport connections and 
broadband provision.
 
OBJ 3.3 Ensure economic and housing growth are balanced, to support sustainable 
journeys to work, recognising that we cannot determine where people 
work – some of whom will choose to travel to employment locations 
beyond our district, such as London, Oxford and Reading.
OBJ 3.4 Support the retail and service sectors as well as low and high-tech 
industries. 
OBJ 3.5 Create the conditions whereby world-renowned and cutting edge 
industries choose to locate and grow their businesses here, contributing to 
a strong and successful economy, in line with the Strategic Economic Plan 
for Oxfordshire.
OBJ 3.6 Inspire the next generation of workers by planning for high quality 
education facilities. 
OBJ 3.7 Encourage tourism by protecting our built and natural assets, such as the 
Thames, and providing services and facilities for visitors.
Objective 4 - Infrastructure 
OBJ 4.1 Ensure that essential infrastructure is delivered to support our existing 
residents and services as well as growth. 
OBJ 4.2 Make sustainable transport, walking and cycling an attractive and viable 
choice for people, whilst recognising that car travel and parking provision 
will continue to be important in this predominantly rural district.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202017Objective 5 - Design
OBJ 5.1 Deliver high quality, innovative, well designed and locally distinctive 
developments in sustainable locations with regard to the South 
Oxfordshire Design Guide.

health facilities. 
OBJ 6.3 Ensure all communities have access to the services and facilities they value, 
supporting access to sport and recreation and the health and wellbeing of 
everyone.
Objective 7 - Natural and Built Environment
OBJ 7.1 Protect and enhance the natural environment, including biodiversity, the 
landscape, green infrastructure and our waterways, placing particular 
importance on the value of the Oxford Green Belt, our two Areas of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty and the River Thames. 
OBJ 7.2 Conserve and enhance our rich and varied historic assets and their 
settings, celebrating these as some of our strongest attributes.
Objective 8 - Climate Change
OBJ 8.1 Minimise carbon emissions and other pollution such as water, air, noise 
and light, and increase our resilience to the likely impact of climate 
change, especially flooding. Lower energy use and support an increase in 
renewable energy use. Support growth in locations that help reduce the 
need to travel.18
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020193   OUR SPATIAL STRATEGY
Introduction
3.1 Our spatial strategy sets out how we will deliver the vision and objectives set 
out in Chapter 2. It identifies the roles that Science Vale, including Didcot 
Garden Town and Culham, the market towns, the villages and the countryside, 
including areas adjacent to Oxford City allocated for strategic development in 
this Plan will play in the future. It shows where new homes will be built, where 
opportunities to provide new jobs will be created, and where infrastructure and 
services will be required. It shows how we will work in partnership to deliver 
the strategy with those responsible for key services, including healthcare, 
education, transport, water supply and community safety and with others such 
as affordable housing providers.
3.2 Local planning authorities have a responsibility to plan positively and work 
collaboratively. We cannot plan in isolation, and South Oxfordshire has been 
working with, and continues to work with the other Oxfordshire authorities, 
supported by the Oxfordshire Growth Board, Local Enterprise Partnership, key 
stakeholders, our parish and town councils and infrastructure providers and 
with government. We have signed up to the Oxfordshire Housing and Growth 
Deal which commits the Oxfordshire authorities to delivering growth.
3.3 The Plan seeks to meet needs identified for South Oxfordshire as well as all 
the needs apportioned to the district arising from our neighbour Oxford City. 
A joint work programme with the other Oxfordshire authorities2 identfied the 
scale of Oxford City’s unmet needs and how they can best be met. 
3.4  All allocations made in the Core Strategy are retained and the Local Plan makes 
provision for housing to meet additional housing requirements identified in the 
Oxfordshire Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) 2014. The strategy 
has been updated to help address the key challenges facing the district now 
and to make best use of available opportunities.
3.5 Our strategy delivers sustainable development, supporting the presumption in 
favour of sustainable development set out in national policy.

South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020The Strategy
3.6 Historically, growth in South Oxfordshire has been largely focused upon Didcot 
and the market towns of Thame, Wallingford and Henley-on-Thames. Other 
than Wallingford, these towns are located towards the boundary of our district 
and the historic focus of development to the periphery of the district has 
led to a reduction in development to support the investment in services and 
infrastructure in other areas. 
3.7 The issues and options version of the Local Plan presented a series of potential 
options for the distribution of development within the district.
a) Core Strategy approach
b) Science Vale and ‘sustainable settlements’
c) All in Science Vale
d) All in single new settlement
e) Dispersal
f) Next to neighbouring major urban areas (Reading/Oxford)
g) Raising densities (from 25dph)
h) Locating development in settlements where it could help fund projects.
3.8 Each of these options was consulted upon and tested through the 
Sustainability Appraisal. The final strategy is to principally focus development 
at Science Vale and sustainable settlements (which include Towns and Larger 
Villages), where over 70% of housing will be located and to deliver elements 
of some of these options rather than favouring any one scenario in isolation. 
The strategy draws together the Core Strategy approach with development at 
Science Vale and next to the neighbouring major urban area of Oxford. It is 
also complemented by the location of development to fund regeneration and 
by the Local Plan raising densities. Drawing on a combined approach to the 
distribution of new housing development enables a series of benefits to be 
delivered through the Local Plan and this ensures that the housing needs of the 
district can be accommodated.
3.9 Our strategy supports the delivery of new housing and economic growth and 
translates our vision and objectives under inter-related spatial themes to:
• Support a strong network of vibrant settlements including the 
regeneration of town centres, making the whole district more sustainable, 
recognising the rural nature of South Oxfordshire and the effects 
generated by nearby major centres;
• Contribute to tackling climate change;Drawing on

environmental quality;
• Create a thriving economy in urban and rural areas with a range of work 
opportunities including more high value jobs and enable the up-skilling of 
our workforce to support existing and new businesses;
• Deliver sufficient new homes to meet the needs of the communities and 
economy supported by appropriate infrastructure, services and facilities;
• Maintain and enhance the built, historic and natural environment and 
ensure good quality developments and design.

South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
3.10 The Local Plan seeks to build upon the existing settlement hierarchy and 
actively create a sustainable pattern of development throughout the district. 
It identifies strategic allocations at seven locations at Chalgrove, Culham, 
Berinsfield, Grenoble Road, Northfield, North of Bayswater Brook and Wheatley.
3.11 The spatial strategy supports growth in locations that help reduce the need 
to travel such as the focus at Science Vale, Towns and Larger Villages as well 
as allocations adjacent to the City of Oxford. Appendix 16 of the Local Plan 
highlights all elements of the Local Plan where the Plan helps to minimise 
carbon emissions, lower energy use and help to reduce the need to travel.
Policy STRAT1: The Overall Strategy 
1. Proposals for development in South Oxfordshire will be assessed 
using national policy and guidance and the whole of the Development 
Plan* and should be consistent with the overall strategy of:
i) focusing major new development in Science Vale including 
sustainable growth at Didcot Garden Town and Culham so that 
this area can play an enhanced role in providing homes,   jobs 
and services with improved transport connectivity;
ii) providing strategic allocations at Chalgrove,   Culham,   Berinsfield,  
Grenoble Road,   Northfield,   North of Bayswater Brook and 
Wheatley including necessary infrastructure and community 
facilities;
iii) close working with partner agencies,   neighbouring local 
authorities,   communities and other stakeholders to ensure the 
timely delivery of our strategy,   which will deliver a significant 
amount of growth beyond the end of the plan period;
iv) supporting and enhancing the economic and social 
dependencies between our towns and villages;
v) supporting the roles of Henley-on-Thames,   Thame and Wallingford 
by maintaining and improving the attractiveness of their 
town centres through measures that include environmental 
improvements and mixed-use developments and by providing new 
homes,   jobs,   services and infrastructure;
vi) meeting unmet housing needs of Oxford City on strategic 
allocations adjacent to the boundary of Oxford near to where that 
need arises;
vii) supporting and enhancing the roles of the Larger Villages of 
Benson,   Berinsfield,   Chalgrove,   Chinnor,   Cholsey,   Crowmarsh 
Gifford,   Goring-on-Thames,   Nettlebed,   Sonning Common,  South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202023
Watlington,   Wheatley and Woodcote as local service centres;
viii) supporting Smaller and Other Villages by allowing for limited 
amounts of housing and employment to help secure the 
provision and retention of services;
ix) protecting and enhancing the countryside and particularly those 
areas within the two AONBs and Oxford Green Belt by ensuring 
that outside of the towns and villages any change relates to 
very specific needs such as those of the agricultural industry or 
enhancement of the environment;
x) supporting and enhancing our historic environment; and
xi) contributing to tackling climate change.
*The Development Plan is outlined in paragraph 1.12
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 & 8.
3.12 Understanding the nature of our towns and villages and how they inter- 
relate and link with places outside the district is a vital part of our strategy. 
Movement patterns are complex and vary with the purpose of the journey. 
Some key services such as main hospitals and regional shopping centres will 
continue to be provided outside the district, particularly in Oxford and Reading.
3.13 The strategy can influence how services and employment are accessed and 
where new development is located within the district. It can support and 
influence where and how service providers deliver their services and encourage 
different and improved ways of delivery.
3.14 South Oxfordshire has around 140 settlements, although some are just isolated 
groups of houses with no community facilities. These vary considerably in size 
and character reflecting their natural setting and historical development. The 
settlements in the district have been categorised by the services and facilities 
they offer and a hierarchy of policies has been established on this basis. We 
looked at these against a range of criteria on employment opportunities, 
schools, health services, recreation and leisure opportunities and access to 
shops and public transport provision to prepare a settlement assessment and 
hierarchy3. Villages have been categorised as being either “Larger Villages”, 
with a wide range of services and facilities in sustainable locations, or “Smaller 
Villages” that have a more limited range of services. There is a clear distinction 
between the villages in the settlement hierarchy but we will be promoting 
development through this Plan to the most sustainable locations. We are 
directing development to the Larger Villages to complement the spatial 
strategy and will support those Neighbourhood Development Plan groups who South 
Oxfordshire 
has around 
140 settlements
3 Settlement Assessment 
Background Paper, South 
Oxfordshire December 201824
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020wish to promote development in the Smaller Villages. In addition, there are 
“Other Villages” which lie at the bottom of the settlement hierarchy, being 
hamlets or very small settlements with very limited or no services. Our Local 
Plan reflects the status of settlements in this assessment.
3.15 Our vision and objectives for South Oxfordshire recognise the rural nature of 
our district and the importance of our rural settlements in contributing to what 
makes South Oxfordshire such a beautiful and prosperous place to live. Our 
strategy for the Local Plan is to continue to ensure that all our communities thrive 
and that everyone has access to services within a short distance. This is achieved 
through our network of settlements and the settlement hierarchy, which ensures 
development takes place within the more sustainable locations of the district.
Meeting our Housing and 
Employment Needs
3.16 National Planning Policy is clear that local planning authorities should, as a 
minimum, provide for the objectively assessed needs for market and affordable 
housing in their area. They should also provide for any needs that cannot be met 
within neighbouring areas where this has been agreed through a statement of 
common ground.
3.17 The NPPF4 and Planning Practice Guidance5 expects local planning authorities to 
use the “standard method” to establish the minimum local housing need figure. 
For South Oxfordshire this results in an annual housing need of 627 homes 
a year. This figure represents the minimum annual housing need for South 
Oxfordshire. It does not automatically translate into the housing requirement for 
the Local Plan, which has taken into account other factors when determining the 
homes to plan for.
3.18 The Planning Practice Guidance6 explains that the standard method for working 
out housing need is just the starting point for working out how many homes 
to plan for. It does not attempt to predict the impact that future government 
policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors, might have on 
demographic behaviour. The Guidance states that Councils should consider 
uplifting the housing requirement for the Local Plan above the results of the 
standard method. It gives the examples of where a housing or growth deal is in 
place, where strategic infrastructure improvements are planned to support new 
homes, where an authority has agreed to take on unmet need from a neighbour 
(based on that authority’s standard method results), and where a recent Strategic 
Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) suggests higher levels of need. 4 Paragraph 60
5, 6 See Planning Practice 
Guidance - Housing Needs 
AssessmentSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 20202525South Oxfordshire District Council
3.19 South Oxfordshire is a partner of the Oxfordshire Housing and Growth Deal. 
Along with the other District and County Councils in Oxfordshire, we have 
collectively committed to plan for 100,000 new homes between 2011 and 2031. 
In return for this commitment to deliver higher than our local housing needs, 
government has granted some flexibilities with regard to our housing land 
supply in the short term, as well as committing to £150m worth of infrastructure 
funding for the first five years of the deal. 
3.20 The Growth Deal itself is not however an assessment of housing need. It does 
not seek to model the growth in population, address affordability or identify 
the effects of changes in government policy or economic circumstances might 
have on housing needs. Consequently, the Growth Deal does not identify 
housing requirement for each district, nor does it attempt to apportion any 
housing needs from one authority to another.
3.21 The Deal derives its aspirational housing target from the Oxfordshire SHMA. The 
SHMA was published in April 2014 and is therefore close to the five-year lifespan 
that planning documents have before the NPPF directs they must be reviewed. 
Furthermore, the SHMA is based on 2011 “interim” household projections, and so 
the base data on which it is grounded is now quite dated. The SHMA is also based 
on a methodology for working out housing needs that was set out in the first NPPF 
(March 2012) and original Planning Practice Guidance. 
3.22 However, the SHMA is the only document that provides an evidenced approach 
to the 100,000 homes identified in the Oxfordshire Growth Deal. It is also the 
only document that seeks to split the 100,000 home target between each of 
the constituent authorities. The SHMA looked at both the expected growth in 
population, the anticipated economic growth between 2011 and 2031 and the 
need to support affordable housing provision.
3.23 The SHMA is based on economic forecasts and considers a number of possible 
economic growth scenarios. In South Oxfordshire, the evidence considers that the 
provision of 750 dwellings a year would support economic growth. It represents 
the committed economic growth scenario forecast in the SHMA and takes forward 
planned growth set out in the Strategic Economic Plan. This is primarily to meet the 
needs of our existing businesses wishing to expand and to allow for new business 
formation at similar rates to the past. A proportion of this provision would also 
meet the need for affordable housing in the district.
3.24 Based on these assessments, the SHMA made recommendations in terms of the 
housing range that the Local Plan should be planning for which recognised that 
the affordable housing evidence provided a basis for considering higher housing In South 
Oxfordshire, 
the evidence 
considers that the 
provision of 750 
dwellings a year 
would support 
economic growth26
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020provision. This was presented in the form of a range which identifies a total need 
for between 14,500 and 16,500 homes for South Oxfordshire over the twenty-
year period 2011-2031. This would equate to an annual provision of between 725-
825 new homes. The 100,000 home target of the Growth Deal is based on the 
midpoint of this range (775 homes a year).
3.25  The Growth Deal commitments and the Oxfordshire SHMA are a sound 
justification for uplifting South Oxfordshire’s housing requirement above the 627 
homes per year from the standard method. Taken together, the evidence sets a 
housing requirement for South Oxfordshire of 775 homes a year between 2011 
and 2035, or a total plan requirement of 18,600 homes. This is explained further in 
Section 5 of this Plan and the Housing Topic Paper. 
3.26 Oxford City Council has identified that it will have difficulty in meeting its own 
identified housing commitments of the Growth Deal, and has asked the other 
Oxfordshire authorities to assist in the provision of housing. South Oxfordshire 
District Council has engaged constructively, actively and on an ongoing basis with 
all the authorities and relevant prescribed bodies in Oxfordshire under the Duty 
to Cooperate to identify the scale of unmet need and how Oxford City’s housing 
requirement should be distributed across the county.
3.27 In September 2016 the Oxfordshire Growth Board considered a Memorandum 
of Cooperation between each of its five members on how to accommodate the 
levels of unmet need arising from Oxford City. This was based on the housing 
need set out in the 2014 SHMA and consequently the Oxfordshire Growth 
Deal. It sets out an amount of housing for each authority to plan for, based on 
an assumed unmet need of 15,000 homes from Oxford City. It also included 
an agreement that the delivery of these homes would be monitored as part of 
housing land supply calculations from 1 April 2021 to allow local plans to come 
forward to address this need. 
3.28 The Council considers that it can meet the full 4,950 homes apportioned to South 
Oxfordshire through this agreement, and proposes to monitor this between 1 
April 2021 and 31 March 2035.
3.29 The Oxford City Council Local Plan identifies a housing target of 1,400 homes a 
year based on the Oxfordshire SHMA, the Oxfordshire Growth Deal, and a 2018 
SHMA “roll forward”. This Council has agreed to support Oxford City in meeting 
their housing needs to 2036. The Local Plan does so through providing a total of 
4,950 homes between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2035.
 
3.30 To ensure that we meet the needs requested by Oxford City, the Local Plan has Oxford City 
Council has 
identified that 
it will have 
difficulty in 
meeting its 
own identified 
housing 
commitments 
of the Growth 
DealSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202027identified strategic sites on the edge of the City. These sites will also provide an 
increased level of affordable housing in line with those levels required by Oxford 
City as set out in Policy H9 (Affordable Housing). 
3.31 Along with the other authorities in Oxfordshire, the Council will continue to 
monitor the housing needs of Oxford City. The Oxfordshire Plan 2050 will be the 
appropriate plan for addressing any needs that arise for Oxford City beyond 2036.
3.32 There is an uncertainty as to how the emerging Oxford to Cambridge corridor 
might impact on South Oxfordshire and the other districts of Oxfordshire. A 
Ministerial Statement has been published7 endorsing the recommendations of 
the NIC8 to establish a new corridor between the two cities, but uncertainty 
remains as to how the corridor is to actually be created and how the growth plans 
adopted by Councils across the corridor might be aligned. South Oxfordshire 
will be undertaking a review of its Local Plan once both Oxford City and South 
Oxfordshire have adopted their plans and the implications of the Oxford to 
Cambridge corridor, including the route of a proposed Expressway between the 
two cities, are clearer. This is the most appropriate and responsible manner in 
which to plan for additional homes until the full extent is known.
 
3.33 The housing requirement for South Oxfordshire is set out in Policy STRAT2.
3.34 National Planning Policy requires that planning policies should help create the 
conditions in which businesses can invest, expand and adapt. It is clear that local 
planning authorities should set out a clear economic vision and strategy which 
positively and proactively encourages sustainable economic growth.
3.35 The 2014 SHMA forecasts anticipated economic growth across Oxfordshire and 
the district between 2011 and 2031. The SHMA forecasts a total increase in

employment of around 88,000 people for Oxfordshire with an increase of 11,455 
jobs in South Oxfordshire from 2011 to 2031. The 2017 ‘South Oxfordshire 
Employment Land Review Addendum’ (SOELRA’) examines the forecasts of the 
2014 SHMA. Based on the SHMA, the SOELRA projects an increase of 12,403 jobs 
from 2011 to 2033. 
3.36 To plan for the economic growth forecast in the 2014 SHMA, the SOELRA 
forecasts that 35.9 hectares of additional employment land is required in the 
district over the period 2011 to 2033. As this employment forecast ends at 2033, 
to account for the additional years in the plan period, a further 3.2 hectares is 
required. This results in a minimum requirement of 39.1 hectares of employment 
land in the district over the period 2011 to 2035.
3.37 In order encourage sustainable economic growth and meet this requirement, the 
Local Plan identifies locations and allocations for employment throughout the 
district, dispersed between the Plan’s strategic allocations and the sustainable 
locations. This approach reflects the Local Plan’s spatial strategy. 
3.38 Our locations for employment are as follows, as set out further in Policy EMP1:
 Within Science Vale:
• Culham Science Centre and the adjacent strategic site;
• Didcot, albeit with some in the Vale of White Horse;
• the strategic sites in Berinsfield. 
 At sustainable locations:
• The strategic sites in Chalgrove and Grenoble Road; the towns of 
Henley-on-Thames, Thame and Wallingford with sites to be identified in 
Neighbourhood Development Plans; and
• at Crowmarsh Gifford with sites to be identified in Neighbourhood 
Development Plans. 
Policy STRAT2: South Oxfordshire Housing and 
Employment Requirements
1. During the plan period,   provision will be made to meet the following 
requirements:
2. Housing requirements 
 •South Oxfordshire Minimum Housing Requirement - 18,600 
between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2035;  
 •4,950 homes addressing Oxford’s unmet housing need
 •(between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2035).
 •Total housing requirement for the plan period 23,550 homes.  South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202029
The annual requirement is as follows:
 •  2011/12 to 2025/26 - 900 homes per annum;
 • 2026/27 to 2031/32 - 1,120 homes per annum;
 • 2032/33 to 2034/35 - 1,110 homes per annum. 
3. Employment land requirements 
 •South Oxfordshire Minimum Employment Land Requirement 39.1  
hectares between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2035.
4. These requirements are to be delivered in accordance with the spatial 
strategy set out in STRAT1.
5. The locations and trajectory for housing development is identified in 
Policy H1.
6. The appropriate level of new housing and employment will be 
monitored and a review undertaken within five years following the 
adoption of the Local Plan,   taking into account the most up-to-date 
evidence available at that time.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 2 & 3.
Didcot and Science Vale
3.39 Science Vale is already an international location for science and technology. 
From this strong starting point, we need to capitalise on Science Vale’s 
opportunity to provide an even better environment for business to flourish. 
Science Vale is one of the most successful science clusters in the UK. This 
activity is concentrated around the three centres for science at Harwell 
Campus, Culham Science Centre and Milton Park, but is supported by a 
number of important settlements. Didcot is at the heart of Science Vale. It 
makes the first and leaves the last impression on anyone travelling to Science 
Vale from elsewhere in the UK or from across the globe and it provides the 
ideal opportunity to act both as a gateway and a hub.
3.40 The Local Plan’s vision for Science Vale in 2035 is grounded in continuing this 
story of economic success and channelling this prosperity into improved social 
and environmental wellbeing: the area will consist of thriving communities that 
have benefited from sustainable growth and the successful delivery of major 
infrastructure.From this strong 
starting point, 
we need to 
capitalise on 
Science Vale’s 
opportunity 
to provide an 
even better 
environment 
for business to 
flourish30
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 20203.41 One of the priorities for Science Vale is to provide an environment in which 
science-led business can flourish. Part of this is ensuring that the Local 
Plan promotes an attractive and diverse housing offer, set in an area with 
good transport and communications networks, links to university research, 
‘big science’, the space sector and cutting edge technology. Clustering 
development in one area gives a critical mass of economic, social and 
cultural activity to support the delivery of infrastructure and sustain vibrant 
town centres. Science Vale has fewer development constraints than much 
of Oxfordshire and offers well established road and rail networks. These 
transportation links are already driving investment and supporting job growth. 
Continued economic growth is supported with a priority to respect the Oxford 
Green Belt and North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
3.42 Didcot is the gateway to Science Vale. It connects Science Vale with the rest 
of the UK through direct train services to Oxford, London, and Bristol. Yet 
the economic and social links between Didcot and the rest of Science Vale 
remain weak. An important part of our strategy for Science Vale is to improve 
and strengthen its relationship with Didcot, and realise Didcot’s full potential 
as a thriving and attractive location to live, work and visit. We will do this by 
providing the homes, jobs, skills, and infrastructure needed to turn Didcot into 
a successful and sustainable town in its own right, and a vital part of a thriving 
Science Vale.Didcot is the 
gateway to 
Science Vale
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202031The Strategy for Science Vale
3.43 Our strategic approach for Science Vale:
• Excellent design embedded in development throughout Science Vale
• Protection for the distinctive character and heritage of Science Vale’s 
towns, villages and countryside
• A range of new homes, to balance the new jobs
• Opportunities for people to build their own homes in appropriate locations
• Didcot transformed into a well serviced and well connected high quality 
urban hub, including new social infrastructure (such as schools and medical 
facilities and a new leisure centre) to support the growing population
• A “step change” in travel choices away from car travel towards public 
transport, cycling and walking with Didcot at the heart of a fully 
connected Science Vale
• Didcot Parkway Railway Station and its role as a major rail interchange 
improved
• New innovative housing to be provided linked to the existing Culham 
Science Centre
• Culham railway station to be improved and transformed into a focal point 
for the new community
• A new railway station at Grove in the longer term
• Improvements to capacity of the rail lines
• Convenient bus services throughout the area 
• More and better cycling and walking links to encourage reliable, active 
and healthy travel
• Improved access onto the A34
• Aspirations for Superfast Broadband across all of Science Vale by 2035.
Didcot Garden Town 
3.44 In December 2015, the Government announced that Didcot would become 
a Garden Town delivering 15,050 homes and 20,000 high-tech jobs in the 
greater Didcot area. Garden Towns are locally-led and ambitious proposals for 
new communities that work as self-sustaining places and should have high 
quality and good design embedded from the outset9.
3.45 The designation of Didcot as a Garden Town is an exciting opportunity. Both 
South Oxfordshire and Vale of White Horse District Councils are working 
closely together and in partnership with Oxfordshire County Council and other 
key stakeholders to develop a joined up vision and delivery strategy for the 
area. The Didcot Masterplan Area is shown in Appendix 6.9 DCLG 2016. Locally-led Garden 
Villages, Towns and Cities.32
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
3.46 It is important the area realises its potential as a thriving and attractive location 
to live, work and visit and in particular to provide a high quality service centre 
at the heart of Science Vale. This will allow Science Vale’s international 
reputation for science and technology to support continued and accelerated 
growth of businesses in these sectors.
3.47 The Garden Town initiative will help to shape growth already identified 
through the Local Plan for housing, employment and infrastructure.
3.48 To support the successful implementation of the Garden Town initiative, 
six high level principles have been developed to help shape development 
proposals that come forward. Proposals for development within the Garden 
Town Masterplan Area as set out in the Didcot Garden Town Delivery Plan 
will be expected to demonstrate how they comply with these principles in 
accordance with Policy STRAT3.
3.49 The Housing and Infrastructure Fund awarded to Oxfordshire County Council 
of £218m will enable the delivery of infrastructure to support key sites in and 
around Didcot. This includes sites in Vale of White Horse District.
Policy STRAT3: Didcot Garden Town
1. Within the Didcot Garden Town masterplan area the Local Plan will:
i) promote Didcot as the gateway to Science Vale;
ii) identify Didcot as the focus of sustainable major new 
development for Science Vale;
iii) support and the delivery of ambitious Green Infrastructure 
provision and plan safe,   healthy and active spaces,   supported by 
Policy ENV5;
iv) focus on enhancing rail services to Didcot,   complemented by 
measures to enhance Didcot Parkway station and improve 
access by all sustainable modes of transport;
v) strike a balance to provide for housing growth and economic 
growth;
vi) assist in having policies supporting the acquisition of significant 
funding investment and safeguarding land to implement 
infrastructure schemes;
vii) enable flexibility and resilience to plan for future changes,  
including changing community needs,   addressing climate change 
and impacts,   supporting technology and scientific advances inSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202033
 infrastructure provision;
viii) require infrastructure to unlock development in Didcot Town 
Centre,   Didcot and the wider area;
ix) support the continued delivery of development in the Science 
Vale and Didcot Enterprise Zones.
2.  To deliver Didcot Garden Town,   housing allocations at Didcot are 
made in Policy H2 New Housing in Didcot.
3.  Significant infrastructure improvements are committed to under Policy 
TRANS1b Supporting Strategic Transport Investment. Infrastructure 
will need to be in place to enable sites allocated in the Local Plan in 
and around Didcot to be delivered.
4.  Provision is made for employment at identified employment sites 
across Didcot in line with Policy EMP1 The Amount and Distribution of 
New Employment Land and EMP4 Employment Land in Didcot.
5.  Didcot’s role as a major town centre is established in Policy TC2 Town 
Centre Hierarchy.
6.  Proposals for development within the Didcot Garden Town 
Masterplan Area,   as defined on the Policies Map and shown by 
Appendix 6,   will be expected to demonstrate how they positively 
contribute to the achievement of the Didcot Garden Town Masterplan 
Principles (Figure 1).
This policy contributes towards achieving objective 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.
Figure 1 - Didcot Garden Town Principles
Design - The Garden Town will be characterised by design that adds value 
to Didcot and endures over time; it will encourage pioneering architecture 
of buildings and careful urban design of the spaces in between, prioritising 
green spaces over roads and car parks. All new proposals should show the 
application of the Council’s adopted Design Guide SPD and demonstrate best 
practice design standards.
Local Character - The Garden Town will establish a confident and unique 
identity, becoming a destination in itself that is distinctive from surrounding 34
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020towns and villages whilst respecting and protecting their rural character and 
setting. Didcot’s identity will champion science, natural beauty, and green 
living, in part delivered through strengthened physical connections and active 
public and private sector collaboration with the Science Vale.
Density and tenure - The Garden Town will incorporate a variety of densities, 
housing types and tenures to meet the needs of a diverse community. This 
will include high density development in suitable locations, such as in central 
Didcot and near sustainable transport hubs; higher density development 
will be balanced by good levels of public realm and accessible green space. 
Professionally managed homes for private rent (also known as build to rent) 
could play an important role in meeting housing need.
Transport and movement - The Garden Town will reduce reliance on 
motorised vehicles and will promote a step-change towards active and public 
transport through the creation of a highly legible, attractive and accessible 
movement network and the appropriate location of housing, employment and 
leisure facilities. The Garden Town will seek to improve opportunities for access 
to sport and physical activities through Sport England’s active Design Principles. 
Cycling and pedestrian links between the Garden Town, its surrounding 
villages, natural assets and the strategic employment sites will be enhanced.
Heritage - The Garden Town will conserve and enhance heritage assets, both 
designated and non-designated, within and adjacent to the development 
area. This includes the Scheduled Monuments of the settlement sites north of 
Milton Park and east of Appleford and any archaeological remains and historic 
landscapes and/ or landscape features identified in the Oxfordshire Historic 
Environment Record, the Oxfordshire Historic Landscape Character Assessment, 
other sources and/or through further investigation and assessment.
Landscape and Green Infrastructure - New development in the Garden Town 
will enhance the natural environment, through enhancing green and blue 
infrastructure networks, creating ecological networks to support an increase 
(or where possible achieve a net gain) in biodiversity and supporting climate 
resilience through the use of adaptation and design measures. The Garden 
Town will also seek to make effective use of natural resources including energy 
and water efficiency, as well as exploring opportunities for promoting new 
technology within developments. Innovative habitat planting and food growing 
zones will characterise the Garden Town and, in turn, these measures will 
support quality of life and public health.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202035
Social and community benefits - The planning of the Garden Town will be 
community-focused, creating accessible and vibrant neighbourhoods around 
a strong town centre offer of cultural, recreational and commercial amenities 
that support well-being, social cohesion and vibrant communities. The Garden 
Town will embrace community participation throughout its evolution. It will 
promote community ownership of land and long-term stewardship of assets 
where desirable.
Implementing the Spatial 
Strategy
Policy STRAT4: Strategic Development
1. New development will be provided within strategic allocations in 
order to deliver the scale and distribution of development set out in 
Policies STRAT1 and STRAT2 in this chapter.
2. Development proposals should enable a comprehensive scheme to 
be delivered within each strategic allocation. Developers must ensure 
that the sites provide an appropriate scale and mix of uses,   in suitable 
locations,   to create sustainable developments that support and 
complement the role of existing settlements and communities.
3. Proposals must be accompanied by a comprehensive masterplan for 
the entire strategic allocation. This should demonstrate how new 
development will integrate with and complement its surroundings in 
an appropriate manner.
4. Proposals must ensure that necessary supporting infrastructure 
is provided. Developers must engage with relevant infrastructure 
providers to ensure the implementation of the Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan.
5. Proposals to deliver strategic development need to be supported by:
i) a Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment;
ii) a Health Impact Assessment;
iii) a Transport Assessment;36
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
iv) an Air Quality Assessment;
v) an Arboricultural Survey;
vi) an Ecological Impact Assessment;
vii) a site specific flood risk assessment which takes into 
consideration the findings and recommendations of the Strategic 
Flood Risk Assessment;
viii) a Heritage Impact Assessment;
ix) an archaeological desk based assessment to provide an 
assessment of archaeological significance; and
x) a statement of how it is intended to achieve low carbon 
emissions and facilitate renewable energy generation.
6. Each development will be expected to provide:
i) a scheme of an appropriate scale,   layout and form which 
respects the surrounding character and setting;
ii) high quality public transport facilities and connections within 
and adjacent to the site;
iii) appropriate vehicular,   cycle and pedestrian access including 
safe and attractive connections with nearby communities and 
employment areas;
iv) investigation and mitigation by the developer of any former 
land uses on the site which may give rise to contamination;
v) a Noise Assessment including noise during construction and 
noise insulation of development;
vi) a Landscape Management Plan to provide appropriate 
landscaping and an integrated network of Green Infrastructure;
vii) an Ecological and Landscape Management Plan to be provided 
to manage habitats onsite;
viii) an integrated water management plan to include proposed foul 
and surface water drainage strategies; 
ix) leisure facilities and playing pitches as outlined in the Council’s 
current Leisure Study; and
x) low carbon development and renewable energy.
7. This policy will also be used to determine planning applications for 
large scale major development.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202037
Housing Density
Policy STRAT5: Residential Densities 
1. Planning permission will only be granted where it can be 
demonstrated that the proposal optimises the use of land and 
potential of the site. Developments should accommodate and sustain 
an appropriate amount and mix of uses (including green space and 
other public space) and support local facilities and transport networks.
2. The density of a development should be informed by:
i) the capacity of the site and the need to use land efficiently in 
accordance with Policy DES7: Efficient use of resources;
ii) the need to achieve high quality design that respects local 
character;
iii) local circumstances and site constraints,   including the required 
housing mix,   and the need to protect or enhance the local 
environment,   Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty,   heritage 
assets,   and important landscape,   habitats and townscape;
iv) the site’s (or,   on strategic allocations,   the relevant part of the 
sites’s) current and future level of accessibility to local services 
and facilities by walking,   cycling and public transport; and
v) the need to minimise detrimental impacts on the amenity of 
future and/or adjoining occupiers.
3. Sites well related to existing towns and villages and served by public 
transport or with good accessibility by foot or bicycle to the town 
centres of Didcot,   Henley,   Thame and Wallingford or a district centre 
within Oxford City should be capable of accommodating development 
at higher densities. It is expected that these sites will accommodate 
densities of more than 45 dph (net) unless there is a clear conflict with 
delivering a high-quality design or other clearly justified planning 
reasons for a lower density.
4. Given the size,   function and location of the strategic allocations it may 
be more appropriate for these sites to create a new character rather 
than trying to reflect or scale up the existing local character.
5. Applicants should demonstrate that a scheme makes the optimal use 
of the site as part of the masterplan or Design and Access Statement,  38
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
where these are required to support a planning application.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 & 8.
3.50 The NPPF requires consideration of how to efficiently use available land for 
housing in the District. The previous Core Strategy density policy aimed to 
achieve a net density of 25 dwellings per hectare. The Council has undertaken 
research in support of this Local Plan which indicates that this is likely to be an 
ineffective use of land, especially in many of our larger settlements. 
3.51 The research has demonstrated that the Local Plan should be requiring higher 
densities in South Oxfordshire than our previous policy. The benefits of doing 
so include maximising the commercial viability of existing services and facilities 
by concentrating more people within walking distance of them, using less 
available land for development, encouraging the development of smaller (1 
and 2-bedroom properties) which are needed in the district, and resulting in 
longer term energy efficiencies. 
3.52 The approach supports that set out in the NPPF, in that the policy concentrates 
higher densities where there are sustainable transport opportunities – including 
rail and buses, but also walking and cycling (meaning close to existing services, 
facilities, and employment opportunities).  
3.53 Our research indicates that the minimum net density of 45dph where relevant 
can be achieved with a built form that is consistent with the settlement it 
relates to.
3.54 Whilst there are opportunities to optimise density of development to maximise 
the capacity of sites, the design of a site needs to pay careful attention to the 
existing character of a local area and any local circumstances, taking account 
of a range of social and environmental constraints, accessibility and amenity 
issues.
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202039Green Belt
3.55 In 1992 the Central Oxfordshire Local Plan defined the boundaries of the 
Green Belt within South Oxfordshire. 
  
3.56 The five purposes of the Green Belt are to:
• check the unrestricted sprawl of large built up areas;
• prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another;
• assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment;
• preserve the setting and special character of historic towns (such as 
Oxford);
• assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and 
other urban land.
3.57 The Plan has made alterations to the Green Belt to accommodate our strategic 
allocations at Culham, Berinsfield, Grenoble Road, Northfield, Land North of 
Bayswater Brook and Wheatley. These alterations are shown at Appendix 4. 
The individual sections within the Plan which are relevant to each of these 
strategic allocations, provide specific detail on the approach for its release 
and mitigation. The policy requires compensatory measures to be delivered 
to remediate for the removal of land from the Green Belt. This is required 
by the National Planning Policy Framework at paragraph 138. Each relevant 
strategic allocation policy where Green Belt has been altered sets out 
requirements for the site and some of these measures could be considered as 
compensatory measures. Evidence on landscape, biodiversity or recreational 
needs with site specific recommendations and opportunities will also provide 
recommendations for enhancements that would deliver compensatory 
improvements on remaining Green Belt. The compensatory gain would be 
expected to be demonstrated through the individual site masterplans and 
secured through developer contributions if these enhancements are outside of 
the red line boundary of a planning application.
3.58 The Local Plan gives substantial weight to protecting the Green Belt when 
considering any planning application. Only appropriate development will 
be permitted in the Green Belt in accordance with national planning policy; 
inappropriate development will only be permitted in very special circumstances.The Local Plan

South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Policy STRAT6: Green Belt
1. To ensure the Green Belt continues to serve its key functions,   it 
will be protected from harmful development. Within its boundaries,  
development will be restricted to those limited types of development 
which are deemed appropriate by the NPPF,   unless very special 
circumstances can be demonstrated. Very special circumstances will 
not exist unless the potential harm to the Green Belt by reason of 
inappropriateness,   and any other harm resulting from the proposal,   is 
clearly outweighed by other considerations.
2. The Green Belt boundary has been altered to accommodate strategic 
allocations at STRAT8,   STRAT9,   STRAT10i,   STRAT11,   STRAT12,   STRAT13 
and STRAT14,   where the development should deliver compensatory 
improvements to the environmental quality and accessibility of the 
remaining Green Belt land,   with measures supported by evidence of 
landscape,   biodiversity or recreational needs and opportunities. The 
boundaries of the reviewed Green Belt are identified on the changes 
to the Green Belt boundary maps (see Appendix 4).
3. Detailed amendments to the Green Belt made by the Wheatley 
Neighbourhood Development Plan must be in compliance with the 
requirements of the NPPF and the need identified within the Local 
Plan.
 4. Where land has been removed from the Green Belt,   new development 
should be carefully designed to minimise visual impact.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 6 and 7.
Land at Chalgrove Airfield
3.59 Chalgrove Airfield is a former Second World War airfield located directly north 
of the village of Chalgrove, north east of the B480, approximately 11 miles to 
the east of central Oxford and approximately 5 miles south of junction 7 of the 
M40 motorway.
3.60 The airfield opened in 1943 and was closed in July 1946 when it was leased 
to the Martin-Baker company for development and testing of aircraft ejection 
seats. Martin-Baker Aircraft Company Limited (“Martin-Baker”) undertake the South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202041development and testing of aircraft ejection equipment and the operation of a 
pyrotechnic facility at Chalgrove Airfield and also use the runway at Chalgrove 
for the landing and take-off of its own aircraft as well as the aircraft of 
customers. The site contains three runways and a perimeter track surrounded 
by security fencing, with managed grass across the rest of the site. Buildings, 
including the war-time t-2 hangers, are located to the east of the site. The 
site is currently owned by Homes England, but leased and used by Martin-
Baker. Chalgrove Airfield has a CAA Ordinary Licence (number P683) that 
allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as 
authorised by the licensee (Martin-Baker). The site of the Monument Industrial 
Estate to the southeast of the airfield was once part of the airfield. The Local 
Plan safeguards land for Martin-Baker’s continued operations and it supports 
opportunities for increased employment at Monument Business Park.
3.61 RAF Benson were consulted on the disposal of the airfield site and its transfer 
from the Ministry of Defence to Homes England. The MoD has confirmed that 
it has not held flying or landing rights since Martin-Baker’s occupation of the 
site. Any existing arrangements has been agreed between RAF Benson and the 
tenants Martin-Baker, not the landowners. It has also stated that its disposal 
would not have proceeded if operations at Benson were impacted. 
3.62  Homes England, as land owner, had been working with their tenant Martin-
Baker to bring forward proposals for development. Homes England has 
confirmed that they Homes England will continue to try to work with Martin-
Baker to agree terms to facilitate the development. In the event that this 
continues to be unsuccessful, they will seek to use their statutory powers of 
Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) to bring this site forward for development. 
They have advised that their objective is to retain Martin-Baker on site. Martin-
Baker have advised that they will resist Chalgrove Airfield being allocated as a 
strategic housing site and will resist any use of compulsory purchase.
3.63 It is recognised that there exists uncertainty of this site and the outcome of a 
CPO. The housing trajectory clarifies that the Plan is not reliant on development 
coming forward on this site in the first five years of the plan period and 
indeed, no completions have been identified on the site until 2025/2026 at 
the earliest. The future of this site and the allocation will be monitored, and if 
circumstances change the allocation can be revisited through the first review of 
the Local Plan.
3.64 The airfield is flat and largely free from constraints. The site is predominantly 
“previously developed land”. There are no known ecological constraints. 
“Chalgrove Field 1643”, a registered historic battlefield, is located partly within 
and to the east of the site and represents a significant constraint. The Martin-42
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020Baker facility is located on part of this historic battlefield. Detailed heritage and 
archaeological surveys need to be undertaken in line with Policy STRAT4. These 
must make a full record of the significance of heritage assets, demonstrate 
how adverse impacts will be avoided, and they should maximise opportunities 
for increasing understanding and education.
3.65 The site is not located within or adjoining an Air Quality Management Area 
(AQMA) or Air Quality Monitoring Area. However, the neighbouring settlement 
of Watlington approximately 3.2 miles east along the B480 has an Air 
Quality Management Area located around its centre. Additionally, the nearby 
settlements of Stadhampton which is situated to the west of the site along 
the B480 toward Oxford and Little Milton to the north east of the site along 
the A329 on the route towards M40/A40 are subject to air quality monitoring. 
An Air Quality Screening Assessment is to be undertaken in line with Policy 
STRAT4 and demonstrate how adverse impacts can be appropriately mitigated.
3.66 The site is located outside of Flood Zones 2 and 3, however, there are water 
courses in the area and ‘run off’ from the airfield is known to be a local issue. 
The site is also outside the AONB and the Green Belt and is centrally placed in 
South Oxfordshire. We will support the delivery of a sustainable community 
with appropriate infrastructure, a range of services and facilities including 
employment, schools and retail alongside integrated Green Infrastructure and 
leisure opportunities.

Policy STRAT7: Land at Chalgrove Airfield 
Site area: 255 hectares 
1. Land within the strategic allocation at Chalgrove Airfield will be 
developed to deliver approximately 3,000 new homes with at 
least 2,105 to be delivered within the plan period,   5 hectares of 
employment land,   3 pitches for Gypsies and Travellers,   education 
facilities,   public open spaces,   retail and supporting services and other 
community facilities.
2. Proposals to develop Chalgrove Airfield will be expected to deliver: 
i) land safeguarded for the future operations of Martin-Baker to 
include a re-aligned runway to be designed in line with Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA) standards;
ii) affordable housing provision and mix in accordance with Policy 
H9;
iii) a net increase of at least 5ha employment land required to be 
delivered during the plan period on a dedicated employment 
site located where it relates well to and supports the operations 
at Monument Business Park;
iv) the required pitches for Gypsies and Travellers to be 
incorporated in the site masterplan and be appropriately located 
in line with Policy H14 and be delivered during the plan period;
v) sufficient additional education capacity,   likely to be two 2 form 
entry primary schools including early years provision (each 
2.22ha),   one new 8 form entry secondary school with sixth form 
(10.55ha) which incorporates a relocation for Icknield School 
from Watlington and off-site contributions to Special Educational 
Needs (SEN); 
vi) sufficient health care facilities on site or provision of off-site 
contributions to serve the existing and future demand in this 
area,   in accordance with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan;
vii) provision of convenience and comparison floorspace to meet the 
day-to-day needs of Chalgrove and the wider local community in 
accordance with Policy TC2: Town Centre Hierarchy;
viii) all necessary transport infrastructure referring to the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan,   which is likely to include:
a. re-alignment of the B480 through the site;
b.  improvements to highway infrastructure through direct 
mitigation or significant contributions to new or improved 
roads,   such as a bypass or edge road,   including sustainable 44
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
transport improvements,   and where appropriate in 
association with relevant Neighbourhood Development 
Plans and any wider County Council highway infrastructure 
strategy,   around,   but not limited to Benson,   Stadhampton 
Chiselhampton and Watlington,   including highway 
intervention measures to mitigate additional impacts,   both 
transport and environmental (including air quality),   in 
Cuxham,   Chiselhampton,   Little Milton,   Shirburn and other 
settlements where justified. In particular,   land will need to 
be identified and secured for delivery for the proposed route 
of the Chiselhampton,   Stadhampton and Cuxham bypasses,  
as supported by more detailed evidence as it comes forward 
with due regard to the heritage and landscape setting of 
the existing settlements,   as examined through the planning 
application process; 
c.  improvements to the Public Transport network through 
significant contributions to new or improved services 
to include but not limited to increased frequency on the 
Chalgrove to Oxford bus route of 4 buses per hour to be 
supported by highway improvements on the B480 corridor,  
and an east west bus service linking Chalgrove to Didcot 
(and where feasible other employment and growth areas) 
with a target frequency of 2 buses per hour; and
d.  links that encourage walking and cycling through the 
site and to adjacent employment and into the village of 
Chalgrove and to other local destinations by providing new 
connections or improving the existing public rights of way 
network.
ix) an integrated network of Green Infrastructure can be provided 
that both links wildlife habitats and enhances ecologically 
important habitats and open space provision as set out in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan;
x) a scheme that delivers specific mitigation and management of 
surface water and runoff for the benefit of the existing village of 
Chalgrove;
xi) mitigation of potential impact on residential amenity associated 
with the continued use of part of the site as an airfield including 
but not limited to noise pollution; and
xii) low carbon development and renewable energy in accordance 
with STRAT4.
3. The proposed development at Chalgrove Airfield will deliver a scheme 
in accordance with an agreed comprehensive masterplan taking South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202045
into consideration the indicative concept plan. The masterplan must 
be prepared in collaboration and agreed with the Local Planning 
Authority in consultation with Oxfordshire County Council. The 
proposals will be expected to deliver a masterplan that demonstrates:
i) high-quality development that is integrated and relates closely 
to the existing settlement of Chalgrove;
ii) regard to the continued safe use of the airfield and considers 
how the site layout and design can mitigate any potential 
impacts associated with the continued use of the re-aligned 
runway; 
iii) safe access and egress with regard to the existing road network 
and proposed development in close proximity to the site;
iv) long distance views from the AONB have been considered;
v) addresses heritage assets and their settings in accordance with 
Policies ENV6 to ENV10 of this Plan and the NPPF;
vi) a layout that delivers higher density development (a minimum 
of 50 dph) in and around the local centre and along key public 
transport routes. Density should then gradually reduce from 
these locations outwards to provide a transition across the 
site,   with lower density development located on the edges of 
the site,   to minimise the landscape and heritage impact of the 
development and support the integration of the development 
with the existing settlement. The average density for the whole 
site will be between 35 and 50 dph;
vii) high quality walking and cycling routes within the site; 
viii) provision of infrastructure to support public transport through 
the site; and
ix) a net gain in biodiversity which is integrated into the 
masterplan through the creation of priority habitats,   and 
significant native tree planting,   with any residual impacts 
offset through the ecological improvement of a named site in 
South Oxfordshire under the promoter’s control in line with an 
agreed management plan or a recognised biodiversity offsetting 
scheme.
4. The number and phasing of homes to be permitted and the timing 
of housing delivery linked to the planned infrastructure needs to 
be informed by further evidence as per the requirements of other 
policies in the Plan including Policy TRANS4. This will be agreed (and 
potentially conditioned) through the planning application process,   in 
consultation with the relevant statutory authority.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 846
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020Land at Culham Science Centre
3.67 Culham Science Centre (CSC) is owned by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy 
Authority (UKAEA) and is located within ‘Science Vale’. The site hosts the Culham 
Centre for Fusion Energy which includes the Joint European Torus (JET) project. It 
is the leading UK centre for fusion research and technology and is of international 
importance. The site also hosts a number of related businesses. The UKAEA aims 
to redevelop the CSC buildings within the next five years as the current stock 
is outdated. The Government is committed to this world renowned technology 
innovation enclave with high levels of investment planned.  CSC cannot expand 
without necessary infrastructure, including the Didcot to Culham River Crossing 
and Clifton Hampden Bypass.
3.68 The Council recognises the key role of the CSC site and supports and encourages 
its redevelopment.  This site has been inset from the Green Belt as a result of 
this Plan. A masterplan should be prepared and agreed with the Local Planning 
Authority that will consider the future of the whole site. This approach to Culham 
is consistent with the objective to increase the number of high quality jobs in the 
district.
 
3.69 The Council will continue to support the redevelopment and intensification 
of the Culham Science Centre for research and science based business. At 
the adjacent ‘No. 1 site’ and land west of the railway the Council expects 
a mixed use development to be brought forward including the retention 
of employment land, but with improved premises, comprehensively across 
the allocated site and Culham Science Centre. This provides an opportunity 
to provide significant development in a sustainable location. The Local Plan 
proposes development here that will have access to employment opportunities 
as well as public transport at the railway station. This will be a community 
within Science Vale that can make the most of advancing technologies such as 
clean heat and power generation and autonomous vehicles. This development 
will include a variety of services and facilities to support a new community 
including schools, health care and retail. Development in this location will 
also help enable much needed road infrastructure in the area through part-
funding.  The road infrastructure is being forward funded from government 
in anticipation that there will be contributions from the developers benefitting 
from the infrastructure.
3.70 This Local Plan has inset Culham Science Centre and land adjacent to it from 
the Green Belt. The site is at the outer edge of the Green Belt. This location 
is also at a distance from the special historic setting of the City of Oxford and The Local 
Plan proposes 
development 
here that will 
have access to 
employment 
opportunities 
as well as public 
transport at the 
railway stationSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202047does not make a significant contribution towards the purposes of including 
land in the Green Belt to check the unrestricted sprawl of Oxford City. The 
exceptional circumstances justifying a release of the Green Belt through the 
Local Plan in this area are:
• To enable the Culham Science Centre to realise its full potential as a 
science campus where publicly funded science research and commercial 
technology growth can flourish. 
• The additional land provides an opportunity to deliver housing adjacent to 
one of the major employers in southern Oxfordshire.
• Development in this location is at the heart of Science Vale and supports 
the delivery of much needed significant strategic infrastructure.
3.71 The Council supports delivery of a new Thames crossing between Didcot 
and Culham as well as the Clifton Hampden Bypass, as identified in Policy 
TRANS1b. This crossing has strategic transport benefits and is required to 
support development allocated in this Local Plan, as well as development 
allocated in the Vale Local Plan Part 1 and Part 2. It is also part of a package 
of transport infrastructure in this area as identified in the Science Vale Area 
Transport Strategy in the Oxfordshire Local Transport Plan 4.
3.72 The delivery of the following infrastructure is expected to be complete in 2024, 
as it is to be forward funded by the Government’s ‘Housing and Infrastructure 
Fund’ and other existing funding: 
• the Didcot to Culham River Crossing; and 
• the Clifton Hampden Bypass. 
3.73 The Culham Brake Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is located to the north 
west of the STRAT9 site allocation. The Culham Brake SSSI is protected due 
to its national importance as one of the largest populations of the summer 
snowflake Leucojum aestivum. High level assessments suggest that strategic 
development at Culham is unlikely to have any negative hydrological effect 
on the Culham Brake SSSI, as the SSSI is watered directly by the Swift Ditch.  
Appropriate consideration should be given to the SSSI in developing detailed 
proposals for this site which should be in compliance with the indicative 
concept plan below.
3.74 STRAT9 covers part of a minerals safeguarding area as identified in Oxfordshire 
County Council’s Minerals and Waste Core Strategy and the Policies Map 
identifies the location of other minerals safeguarding in the vicinity.48
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Policy STRAT8: Culham Science Centre 
Site area: 77 hectares
1. Proposals for the redevelopment and intensification of the Culham 
Science Centre will be supported where this does not have an 
unacceptable visual impact,   particularly on the character and appearance 
of the surrounding countryside and the Registered Parkland associated 
with Nuneham House.
2. In combination with the adjacent strategic allocation (Policy STRAT9) 
this site will deliver at least a net increase in employment land of 
7.3 hectares (with the existing 10 hectares of the No.1 site retained 
but redistributed across the two strategic allocations). The exact 
siting and phasing of the employment development must be agreed 
through the master planning and subsequent planning application 
process including addressing any heritage assets and their settings in 
accordance with Policy ENV6 and the NPPF.
3. Proposals for development on the site should seek to achieve a net 
gain in biodiversity.  Any residual biodiversity loss should be offset 
through a recognised offsetting scheme.
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202049
4. Opportunities that support job growth and appropriate diversification 
or enterprise “clustering” will be supported to complement the wider 
development proposed in the area. Working proactively with the UK 
Atomic Energy Authority and development partners a masterplan for 
the site that facilitates this growth must be prepared and agreed with 
the Local Planning Authority.
5. Proposals will be expected to deliver low carbon development and 
renewable energy in accordance with STRAT4. 
6. The Culham Science Centre is removed from the Green Belt and inset 
as shown on Land inset from the Green Belt Boundary (Appendix 4) to 
enable this development to be brought forward.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 3 & 8.
Policy STRAT9: Land Adjacent to Culham Science Centre
Site Area : 217 hectares
1. Land within the strategic allocation adjacent to Culham Science Centre 
will be developed to deliver approximately 3,500 new homes,   with 
approximately 2,100 homes within the plan period,   a net increase 
of at least 7.3 hectares of employment land in combination with the 
adjacent Science Centre,   3 pitches for Gypsies and Travellers and 
supporting services and facilities.
2. Proposals to develop Culham will be expected to deliver:
i) in combination with the adjacent Science Centre a net increase 
of employment land of at least 7.3 hectares (with the existing 
10 hectares of the No.1 site retained but redistributed across the 
two strategic allocations). The exact siting and phasing of the 
employment development will be agreed through the planning 
application process;
ii) affordable housing provision and mix in accordance with Policy 
H9;
iii) sufficient additional education capacity,   likely to be a total of 
two new 2 form entry primary schools and one new 8 form 
entry secondary school with sixth form on site and appropriate 50
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
contributions towards Special Education Needs (SEN);
iv) sufficient health care capacity,   likely to be a total of one new GP 
surgery on site to serve existing and future demand in this area 
in accordance with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan;
v) provision of convenience floorspace that meets the day-to-day 
needs of the local community only without impacting on the 
vitality and viability of existing centres in accordance with Policy 
TC2 – Retail Hierarchy;
vi) all necessary infrastructure,   referring to the Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan,   which is likely to include:
a. new junctions onto the A415 and significant contributions 
towards the Clifton Hampden Bypass,   the Didcot to Culham 
River Crossing,   and upgrading the A4074/B4015 junction at 
Golden Balls;
b. provision for excellent sustainable transport facilities 
including,   but not limited to,   new and improvements to 
existing cycle and footpaths including contributions towards 
a ‘Cycle Premium Route’ that is proposed between Didcot 
and Culham; provision of a new cycle bridge and associated 
connectivity and paths across the River Thames to connect 
appropriately with Abingdon on Thames to the north of the 
site; bus improvements including provision of a scheduled 
bus service,   with a minimum of two buses per hour between 
Berinsfield,   Culham and Abingdon,   with options to extend 
or vary services to locations such as Cowley,   Chalgrove and 
Didcot;
c. contributions to Culham station improvements including 
longer platforms,   public realm,   new station building,   and 
potentially car parking.
vii) the provision of appropriate communal parks and gardens and 
amenity greenspace allotments,   children’s playspace and open 
space in accordance with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan; and
viii) low carbon development and renewable energy in accordance 
with STRAT4.
3. The proposed development at Culham will deliver a scheme in 
accordance with an agreed comprehensive masterplan taking into 
consideration the indicative concept plan. The masterplan must 
be prepared in collaboration and agreed with the Local Planning 
Authority in consultation with Oxfordshire County Council. The 
proposals will be expected to deliver a masterplan that demonstrates:
i) a layout that recognises plans for improvements to Culham South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202051
railway station and any associated future rail capacity upgrades,  
recognising its importance and potential to support growth and 
development at the adjacent Science Centre;
ii) a layout that delivers higher density development (a minimum 
of 50 dph) along the principal internal transport corridors,  
adjacent to the local centre and adjacent to the railway station,  
provided it does not adversely impact any existing heritage 
assets. Density should then gradually reduce from these 
locations outwards to provide a transition across the site,   with 
lower density development located on the northern,   southern 
and eastern edges of the site,   to create a permanent defensible 
edge to protect the Oxford Green Belt;
iii) a layout that recognises the overhead power lines on the site 
and avoids the built form beneath these where possible;
iv) appropriate landscaping and an integrated network of Green 
Infrastructure throughout the site and in particular along the 
boundaries of the strategic allocation,   which would allow 
limited through views,   creating a permanent defensible edge 
to protect the Oxford Green Belt. This shall be based on 
landscape character,   including historic landscape characterisation,   
considering the contribution of the site to the setting of Oxford,  
that preserve and enhance the surrounding Green Belt Way and 
River Thames long distance footpaths;
v) a layout and form that respects the setting of the heritage assets 
within and beyond the site; in particular the listed buildings 
and structures (the Culham railway station and rail bridges 
and “Schola Europaea”) and the Registered Park and Garden 
associated with Nuneham House;
vi) a layout that has land which remains undeveloped to the 
northern border of the site and that should be utilised for flood 
plain storage,   protecting the physical boundary features on the 
site;
vii) a layout and appropriate mitigation measures that protect 
Culham Brake Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which lies 
to the north-west of the site,   the Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) 
priority sites to the north of Culham,   and that within the Culham 
Science Centre and numerous BAP priority habitats,   including 
the BAP priority habitat south of Culham Railway station;
viii) high quality walking and cycling routes within the site;
ix) provision of infrastructure to support public transport through 
the site; and
x) a net gain in biodiversity which is integrated into the masterplan 52
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
through the creation of new woodland habitats along the river 
escarpment and ecological enhancements of the floodplain 
habitats,   including a complex of new wetland habitats and 
species rich floodplain meadows. Any residual biodiversity loss 
should be offset through a recognised biodiversity offsetting 
scheme.
4. Archaeological evaluation will need to be undertaken ahead of the 
determination of any planning application in order to assess the 
significance of deposits in line with the NPPF. A scheme of appropriate 
mitigation will be required following this evaluation including the 
physical preservation of significant archaeological features and their 
setting where appropriate.
5. Proposals will need to take account of Policy EP5: Minerals 
Safeguarding Areas. This policy encourages developers to extract 
minerals prior to non-mineral development taking place,  where this is 
practical and environmentally feasible.
6. The number and phasing of homes to be permitted and the timing 
of housing delivery linked to the planned infrastructure needs to 
be informed by further evidence as per the requirements of other 
policies in the Plan including Policy TRANS4. This will be agreed,   (and 
potentially conditioned) through the planning application process,   in 
consultation with the relevant statutory authority.
7. Land adjacent to Culham Science Centre is removed from the Green 
Belt and inset as shown on Land inset from the Green Belt Boundary 
(Appendix 4) to enable this development to be brought forward.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202053Land at Berinsfield
3.75 The village of Berinsfield was previously ‘washed over’ by the Green Belt. The 
Local Plan insets the built up area of the village and an area of greenfield land 
to the east of the village from the Green Belt.
3.76 Delivering growth and regeneration at Berinsfield promotes a sustainable 
pattern of development that will address key issues currently facing the village. 
Development at Berinsfield will deliver the necessary and specific benefits that 
cannot be achieved by developing elsewhere in the district. The location is also 
at a distance from the special historic setting of Oxford and does not make a 
significant contribution towards the purposes of including land in the Green 
Belt to check the unrestricted sprawl of Oxford.
3.77 In April 2016, the Council confirmed the Community Investment Scheme for 
Berinsfield. This initiative identified the challenges that the village is currently 
facing and set out a range of objectives intended to address these challenges. 
In particular, it recognised that the village is currently home to a number of 
community facilities that are of real importance to local residents. However, the 
long-term sustainability of many of these facilities is not assured and, without 
significant investment, could be lost from the village. This would have adverse 
effects on a population which is already affected by relatively high levels of 
deprivation compared to the rest of the district.
3.78 Given this, the exceptional circumstances for releasing land from the Green 
Belt at Berinsfield are as follows:
• the tenure mix of housing in Berinsfield is more unbalanced than in other 
parts of the district, with higher levels of social rent. Releasing land for 
development will help to rebalance the mix as well as provide further 
opportunities for employment and service provision; and 
• for Oxfordshire, the village scores highly on the Indices of Deprivation 
(2019), particularly in the following domains:
• income;
• employment;
• education, skills and training, including adult skills, children and 
young people; and
• access to housing, including affordability.
 Development in this specific location will help to address these matters.
3.79 The expansion of Berinsfield is considered acceptable only if it will lead directly 
to the implementation of a masterplan for the regeneration of the village and 54
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020the funding of the necessary regeneration package identified by the Council 
through the Community Investment Scheme, including the requirements set 
out in Policies STRAT10 and STRAT10i. The regeneration of Berinsfield has 
strong community support and this policy seeks to achieve a unique solution 
which could not otherwise be realised. The tenure mix delivered at Berinsfield 
should be informed by robust local evidence and should seek to address 
existing local need as well as rebalance the mix. It is likely that to achieve this 
the mix will include a higher proportion of units that meet the NPPF definition 
of ‘other affordable routes to home ownership’ such as shared ownership. 
3.80 The Council has undertaken a number of studies which indicate that Berinsfield 
requires investment and regeneration. The Council will support this by further 
work to explore detailed solutions for the regeneration of Berinsfield in 
accordance with Policy STRAT10. This will identify the form that development 
should take in order to deliver the regeneration package identified.
3.81 The Council’s most recent evidence suggests that the necessary regeneration 
package will need to include the following: 
• premises for Berinsfield children’s entre;
• expanded premises for Abbey Woods Academy or a new primary school;
• premises for the Adult Learning Centre; 
• expanded premises for a health centre; 
• upgraded or new premises for the Abbey Sports Centre; and
• a ‘Community Hub’ building – a flexible community space that enables the 
co-location of a range of different users and groups.
3.82 The South Oxfordshire Core Strategy (adopted 2012) explained the exceptional 
circumstances warranting a review of the Green Belt boundary at Berinsfield. 
These were supported by the Inspector at its examination. In line with the 
exceptional circumstances warranting the review, the examining Inspector 
considered that the review of the Green Belt boundary at Berinsfield should 
not be confined to drawing a tight boundary around the built up area.
3.83 In order to deliver the regeneration package the Plan needs to allow for a 
sufficient number of homes to be built at the village. The development will also 
need to make sure it can mitigate its impact on the infrastructure network and 
is expected to make contributions towards off-site infrastructure, including the 
Didcot to Culham River crossing, the Clifton Hampden Bypass, improvements 
to Golden Balls roundabout and a new secondary school on the strategic 
allocation at Culham.
3.84 Through the Council’s work with the community, the viability assessments and 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan, it has been calculated that the number of homes In order to 
deliver the 
regeneration 
package the Plan 
needs to allow 
for a sufficient 
number of 
homes to be 
built at the 
villageSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202055that we need to achieve this regeneration to be around 1,700 new homes.
 
3.85 The proposed strategic allocation therefore extends to around 130 hectares. 
Not all of this land will be needed for development. As part of the cooperative 
masterplanning process the proposals will need to respond to particular 
constraints. It must also consider where development would, and would not 
be, appropriately located; and where Green Infrastructure should be provided, 
including planting to permanently contain and redefine the settlement edge.
3.86 Policy STRAT10 requires any planning application to be supported by a 
comprehensive masterplan for the whole village. The masterplan must include 
extremely sensitive design; landscape planting and the maintenance of key 
views to important landmarks such as the Chiltern Hills and the Wittenham 
Clumps to mitigate any Green Belt harm as best as is possible.
3.87 Given that the existing village of Berinsfield is now inset from the Green Belt, 
the Council is also allocating the important open space within the centre of the 
village as Local Green Space with the support of the local community.
3.88 Berinsfield was awarded Garden Village status in June 2019 and Policy 
STRAT10 sets out the principles that development within the Garden Village, 
including land within the strategic allocation in Policy STRAT10i, should accord 
with. As identified in the Garden Village Bid there is potential for the project 
to become an exemplar for the delivery of high quality place making and well-
being. 
56
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Policy STRAT10: Berinsfield Garden Village
1. Berinsfield Garden Village is defined as the existing village and any 
future development that is contiguous to the existing village including 
land within the strategic allocation in Policy STRAT10i: Land at 
Berinsfield Garden Village.
2. All development within the Berinsfield Garden Village will meet 
the Garden Village principles as set out by the Town and Country 
Planning Association (TCPA) and in accordance with the Berinsfield 
Garden Village principles below:
i)     stewardship and legacy – a cared for garden village of attractive

10 per cent biodiversity net gain and design that responds 
visually to topography and aspect,   multi-functional blue-green 
infrastructure with integrated SuDS from rooftop to attenuation;
iv)   strong sense of place – a connected garden village that creates 
attractive walking and cycling links between the existing village,  
new development and the surrounding countryside;
v)    healthy,   vibrant community – a healthy garden village with 
integrated open space that incorporates ‘edible landscape’,  
orchards,   allotments,   natural play,   private and community 
gardens,   space for healthy lifestyles and social mixing,   tenure 
blind housing and full integration of mixed tenure homes;
vi)   sustainable transport and access – an accessible garden village 
that prioritises walking and cycling,   well designed parking 
solutions,   integrated public transport,   built in capacity in homes,  
businesses and public space to enable innovative transport 
solutions and safe neighbourhoods with natural surveillance and 
smart lighting;
vii)   attention to detail – a legible garden village that people can 
find their way in,   through landmarks,   character areas and 
waymarked routes,   detailed design to make local trips more South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202057
attractive on foot or by bike and use of high-quality materials 
and design.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8
Policy STRAT10i: Land at Berinsfield Garden Village
Site Area: 132 hectares
1. Land within the strategic allocation at Berinsfield Garden Village 
will be developed to provide around 1,700 new homes within the 
plan period,   at least 5 hectares of additional employment land and 
supporting services and facilities. The number of new homes should 
demonstrably support the regeneration of Berinsfield and the delivery 
of the necessary social infrastructure.
 
2. The proposals to develop land at Berinsfield will be expected to 
deliver:
i) development in accordance with Policy STRAT10;
ii) the necessary regeneration package,   referring to the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan,   which is likely to include the 
refurbishment and expansion of the Abbey Sports Centre 
and library to accommodate new community facilities in 
a ’community hub’. This may include new premises for an 
expanded health centre or alternatively premises for a new 
health centre will be provided within the new development;
iii) affordable housing provision in accordance with Policy H9 and 
a mix informed by robust local evidence that seeks to address 
existing local need as well as rebalance the mix of housing 
tenures across the Garden Village;
iv) sufficient education capacity,   which is likely to require one 
additional primary school provided on site,   contributions 
to the enhancement of Abbey Woods Primary School,   and 
contributions to a new secondary school and Special Education 
Needs (SEN) provided off site;
v) provision of convenience floorspace that meets the day-to-day 
needs of the local community only without impacting on the 
vitality and viability of existing centres in accordance with Policy 
TC2 – Retail Hierarchy; 58
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
vi) all necessary transport infrastructure,   referring to the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan,   which is likely to include:
a. a new junction and access onto the A4074 to the north of  
the existing A4074/A415 junction;
b. upgrades to the existing A4074/A415 junction;
c. contributions towards upgrading the A4074/B4015 junction 
at Golden Balls,   the Clifton Hampden bypass,   and the 
Thames River crossing between Culham and Didcot Garden 
Town;
d. provision for excellent public transport facilities including 
pump priming a scheduled bus service,   with a minimum 
of two buses per hour between Berinsfield,   Culham and 
Abingdon,   with options to extend or vary services to 
Chalgrove and Didcot;
e. high quality infrastructure to encourage cycling and 
walking,   and provide links through the site and to adjacent 
employment and into the village of Berinsfield and to other 
surrounding locations including Culham; specifically (but 
not limited to) improving the existing pedestrian/cyclist 
infrastructure along the A415 from Berinsfield to Culham,   and 
providing for a cycle route from Berinsfield to Oxford.
vii) an integrated network of Green Infrastructure that links locally 
important wildlife sites and the enhancement of ecologically 
important habitats including areas of woodland and open space 
provision as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan; 
viii) an accompanying minerals assessment that considers if minerals 
can be extracted in accordance with Policy EP5; 
ix) an accompanying archaeological evaluation that considers the 
areas of known and potential archaeological interest of the site 
in accordance with Policy ENV9; and
x) low carbon development and renewable energy in accordance 
with STRAT4. 
3. The proposed development at Berinsfield will deliver a scheme in 
accordance with an agreed comprehensive masterplan taking into 
consideration the indicative concept plan. The masterplan must 
be prepared in collaboration and agreed with the Local Planning 
Authority in consultation with Oxfordshire County Council. The 
proposals will be expected to deliver a masterplan that demonstrates:
i) appropriate landscaping throughout the site,   including a new 
permanent defensible landscaped edge to protect the Oxford 
Green Belt,   while still maintaining a sense of permanent South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202059
openness between Berinsfield and Drayton St Leonard,   and 
maintaining key views to the Chiltern Hills and Wittenham 
Clumps;
ii) no greater land-take of greenfield land than is necessary to deliver 
the required regeneration and other relevant policy requirements. 
Any part of the developable greenfield area that is not required 
for housing or related infrastructure should provide Green 
Infrastructure including planting to contain the settlement edge;
iii) it has taken account of the archaeological evaluation and 
identified an appropriate scheme of mitigation,   including the 
physical preservation of significant archaeological features and 
their setting,   where appropriate;
iv) the delivery of higher density development (a minimum of 50 
dph),   along key transport corridors and adjacent to the local 
centre,   gradually reducing the scale and density of development 
to provide a transition across the site towards the northern and 
eastern countryside edges where lower density development 
should be delivered,   alongside a network of Green Infrastructure 
and planting to create a new permanent landscaped edge to 
protect the Oxford Green Belt,   to deliver an overall site-wide 
average net density of 35-50 dph;
v) a net gain in biodiversity delivered on site which includes 
extensive new woodland planting in the north and east of the site,  
significant new woodland buffers around the site boundaries and 
green linkages through the site;
vi) high quality walking and cycling routes within the site; and
vii) provision of infrastructure to support public transport through the 
site.
 
4. The number and phasing of homes to be permitted and the timing 
of the housing delivery linked to the planned infrastructure needs 
to be informed by further evidence as per the requirements of other 
policies in the Plan including Policy TRANS4. This will be agreed (and 
potentially conditioned) through the planning application process,   in 
consultation with the relevant statutory authority.
5. Land at Berinsfield is removed from the Green Belt and inset as a 
Garden Village settlement as shown on Land inset from the Green Belt 
Boundary (Appendix 4) specifically to enable this development to be 
brought forward.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.60
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Policy STRAT10ii: Berinsfield Local Green Space
1. Land identified in Appendix 2,   figure (ii),   at the centre of Berinsfield is 
allocated as Local Green Space.
This policy contributes towards achieving objective 6.
Grenoble Road
3.89 Land to the south of Grenoble Road is adjacent to the south of Oxford 
City and was previously located entirely within the Green Belt. The site is 
bordered on its northern edge by the Oxford Science Park, a caravan park, a 
Sewage Treatment Works, the Kassam Stadium an entertainment area, and 
the Blackbird Leys neighbourhood. The site is entirely greenfield land and is 
comprised of several fields with tree lines and hedgerows defining most of 
its boundaries, with the exception of the A4074 on its western edge, and an 
electricity substation on its eastern edge. 
3.90 An urban extension to the southern edge of Oxford will promote a sustainable 
form of development that will in part help the City in addressing its housing 
commitments of the Oxfordshire Growth Deal. Development at Grenoble 
Road will provide specific benefits that would not be achievable elsewhere in 
the district; notably the provision of a new Park and Ride site to the south of 
Oxford, the provision of affordable housing, an extension to the South Oxford 
Science Park and the ability to contribute to the regeneration of Blackbird Leys. 
Furthermore, the site would also benefit from the potential re-opening of the 
Cowley Branch Line at the Oxford Science Park.
3.91 There are several Green Belt studies that have assessed the contribution of the 
land at Grenoble Road to the Green Belt: 
• South Oxfordshire Green Belt Study (September 2015) – Kirkham 
Landscape Planning Ltd and Terra Firma Consultancy 
• Oxford Green Belt Study (October 2015) – Land Use Consultants 
• South Oxfordshire Strategic Sites Green Belt Study (November 2018) – 
Land Use Consultants 
3.92 The Terra Firma Report (September 2015) identified that Grenoble Road  
provided a strong sense of containment for the city. The study also concluded 
that the site played an important role in separating Oxford from Garsington, 
with some intervisibility between the site and Garsington, Marsh Baldon and South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202061Toot Baldon. The study recommended insetting a small parcel of land to the 
southwest of the caravan park from the Green Belt.
3.93 The Oxford Green Belt Study (LUC - October 2015) assessed the site as part 
of the wider parcel of OX15. It noted significant urbanising influences within 
the site such as the sewage treatment works, the caravan park, the substation 
and pylons crossing the site. The study concluded that the site had a limited 
relationship with the historic areas of Oxford.
3.94 The South Oxfordshire Strategic Sites Green Belt Study (November 2018) 
considered that the development of Grenoble Road would constitute urban 
sprawl, but the higher ground to the south provides containment that would 
limit the extent of this sprawl. The study concluded that allocating the site 
would result in moderate harm to the Green Belt.
3.95 The Council took into account the government’s policy in the NPPF relating 
to the Green Belt, and concluded that exceptional circumstances existed to 
release the site from the Green Belt. These include: 
• the development of this site will help to provide for Oxford City’s 
unmet housing need, including affordable housing need, close to 
where that need arises; 
• the provision of a new Park and Ride site to the south of Oxford; 
• an opportunity to provide an extension to the South Oxford 
Science Park; and 
• the ability to contribute to the regeneration of Blackbird Leys. 
 Policy STRAT11 includes mitigation measures to maintain a sense of openness 
between the site and surrounding villages.
3.96 The site has a number of challenges that development would need to address. 
The Sewage Treatment Works generates a significant odour issue on the 
site. In its current form it would not be acceptable to locate new homes 
near the works. An odour study must be completed and submitted prior to 
the commencement of development, with appropriate mitigation measures 
being put in place in accordance with the recommendations of the odour 
assessment.
3.97 The site is also adjacent to Blackbird Leys, one of the most deprived areas of 
Oxfordshire. Part of the justification for releasing this site from the Green Belt 
is that it can support the regeneration of this area through providing new 
housing stock, community facilities, employment and training opportunities 
and excellent sustainable transport links. The development will make a valuable 
contribution towards meeting Oxford City Council’s regeneration objectives for 
Blackbird Leys through the provision of new housing alongside employment The study 
concluded 
that the site 
had a limited 
relationship with 
the historic areas 
of Oxford.62
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
and education facilities.
3.98 The site will also provide for at least 10 hectares of employment land 
incorporating an extension to the South Oxford Science Park to support the 
economic growth of the knowledge industry to the south of the city along the 
Oxfordshire Knowledge Spine.
3.99 Policy STRAT11 makes provision for a new Park and Ride facility on the western 
edge of the site as identified by the Oxfordshire Local Transport Plan 4. It is 
important that the site takes advantage of this sustainable transport hub but 
doesn’t encourage residents to drive from one end of the site to the other to 
catch the bus.
3.100  The site must mitigate its impact on local infrastructure and deliver the 
requirements set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan.
Policy STRAT11: Land South of Grenoble Road 
Site area: 153 hectares
1. Land within the strategic allocation at Grenoble Road will be 
developed to deliver approximately 3000 new homes,   2,480 expected 
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202063
within this Plan period,   provide at least 10 hectares of employment 
land incorporating an extension to the Oxford Science Park,   a Park 
and Ride site adjacent to the A4074 and supporting services and 
facilities.
2. Proposals to develop land south of Grenoble Road will be expected to 
deliver:
i) within the safeguard land,   a new Park and Ride facility adjacent 
to the A4074 as shown in Appendix 5;
ii) affordable housing provision and mix in accordance with Policy 
H9;
iii) provision of convenience floorspace that meets the day-to-day 
needs of the local community only without impacting on the 
vitality and viability of existing centres in accordance with Policy 
TC2 – Retail Hierarchy;
iv) a high-quality development that is fully integrated and relates 
closely to the existing settlement of Blackbird Leys;
v) improvements to existing community facilities and services at 
Blackbird Leys necessary to address impacts arising from the 
increased usage by the residents of land south of Grenoble 
Road;
vi) sufficient education capacity,   likely to be on-site primary school 
provision of one 3-form entry primary school; a 1,200 place 
secondary school with the capability to expand to meet future 
needs; and appropriate contributions towards Special Education 
Needs (SEN);
vii) sufficient contributions towards enabling primary healthcare 
services to address patient growth associated with the 
development,   as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan; 
viii) all necessary transport infrastructure improvements through 
direct mitigation or contributions to new and improved 
infrastructure,   referring to the Infrastructure Delivery Plan,   
which is likely to include:
a. cycling and walking infrastructure network on and off 
site ensuring the site is well connected to Oxford City and 
appropriate surrounding villages;
b. improvements to bus services along the A4074 and B480 
corridors to Oxford City and nearby villages and associated 
infrastructure;
c. improvements to highway infrastructure in the vicinity of the 
site.
ix) open space provision as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery 64
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Plan;
x) be supported by an Air Quality Screening Assessment and 
identify appropriate mitigation in relation to potential impacts 
on the Oxford AQMA;
xi) be accompanied by a comprehensive odour assessment,   the 
methodology of which will be agreed by the Local Planning 
Authority,   that identifies the necessary mitigation required 
to address the odour impact of the sewage treatment works. 
This will need to be submitted and agreed with the Local 
Planning Authority before development can commence,   and 
the mitigation measures implemented in accordance with the 
recommendations of the odour assessment; 
xii) extend the woodland at Sandford Brake Sub Station to ensure 
a buffer between the development and the Sub Station is 
provided; and
xiii) low carbon development and renewable energy in accordance 
with STRAT4.
3. The proposed development at Grenoble Road will deliver a scheme 
in accordance with an agreed comprehensive masterplan for the site 
and a strategy for the regeneration of Blackbird Leys,   taking into 
account the indicative concept plan. The masterplan must be prepared 
in collaboration and agreed with the Local Planning Authority in 
consultation with Oxfordshire County Council and Oxford City 
Council. The proposals will be expected to deliver a masterplan that 
demonstrates:
i) the provision of a network of Green Infrastructure providing 
habitat connections which integrates and improves existing 
hedgerows on the site;
ii) a landscaped urban edge can be created to the south of the 
site to provide a transition into the wider landscape through 
woodland planting. The landscape planting should create a 
strong and defensible edge to Oxford,   and create a permanent 
sense of openness between the site and Nuneham Courtenay,  
Marsh Baldon,   Toot Baldon and Garsington. Only Green 
Infrastructure should be provided on land to the south of 
Minchery Farmhouse to respect the setting of the Grade II* 
listed farmhouse;
iii) a layout that recognises the overhead power lines on the site 
and minimises the location of the built form beneath these;
iv) the delivery of higher density development (a minimum of 70 
dph) around the local centres and (a minimum 60dph) along key South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202065
transport corridors. The northern part of the site will respond to 
sensitivities relating to the listed Minchery Farm and densities 
will gradually reduce towards the southern landscape buffer 
and the eastern edge of the site,   close to the Sandford Brake 
Local Wildlife Site to create a suitable interface with the adjacent 
Green Belt;
v) a net gain in biodiversity,   including proposals to enhance the 
biodiversity value of the watercourse which connects to the 
Littlemore Brook.  Any residual biodiversity loss should be offset 
through a recognised biodiversity offsetting scheme;
vi) high quality walking and cycling routes within the site; and
vii) provision of infrastructure to support public transport through 
the site.
4. The number and phasing of homes to be permitted and the timing 
of housing delivery linked to the planned infrastructure needs to 
be informed by further evidence as per the requirements of other 
policies in the Plan,   including Policy TRANS4. This will be agreed (and 
potentially conditioned) through the planning application process,   in 
consultation with the relevant statutory authority.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.
Northfield
3.101  The site at Northfield is located on the edge of Oxford City’s administrative 
boundary. The site is bounded in the north west by the Unipart factory 
and other key employment sites within the city, the B480 to the west, and 
Northfeld Brook/agricultural land to the south and east. The site also relates 
well to other key business areas in Oxford city, including Oxford Science Park 
and Oxford Business Park. Furthermore, the site relates well with the strategic 
allocation within this Plan at Grenoble Road.
3.102  An urban extension on the southern edge of Oxford will promote a sustainable 
form of development that will in part, assist the City in addressing its housing 
commitments of the Oxfordshire Growth Deal. Northfield is well located for 
access to employment and services within walking and cycling ranges and the 
B480 is an existing public transport corridor. There are opportunities to provide 
improved transport links.66
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 20203.103  This site was previously located entirely within the Oxford Green Belt, however 
the Council took into account the government’s policy in the NPPF relating to 
Green Belt and concluded that exceptional circumstances existed to inset this 
site from the Green Belt. The site specific exceptional circumstances for doing 
this are:
• The development of this site will help to provide for Oxford City’s unmet 
housing need, including affordable housing need, adjacent to and related 
to where that need arises.
3.104  There are also other constraints that development would be required to 
address. The southern part of the site contains an area of Flood Zone 2 
and 3, with Hollow Brook and Northfield Brook running through this area. 
Furthermore, there is an increase in landscape sensitivity to the east of the 
site, which has a stronger relationship with the surrounding landscape. A line 
of electricity pylons runs across the eastern edge of the site. Development will 
have to be sensitively designed to address these constraints. 
3.105  The development will be required to mitigate its impact on the local 
infrastructure as per the policy requirements below. Developer funding will be 
expected to contribute towards enabling primary healthcare services to deal 
with patient growth associated with development and local upgrades to the 
existing water network and water supply infrastructure as well as a range of 
other matters such as transport.
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202067
Policy STRAT12: Land at Northfield 
Site area: 68 hectares
1. Land within the strategic allocation at Northfield will be developed to 
deliver approximately 1,800 new homes and supporting services and 
facilities within the plan period. 
2. Proposals to develop Northfield will be expected to deliver:
i) affordable housing provision and mix in accordance with Policy 
H9;
ii) sufficient educational capacity likely to be for up to a new 3-form 
entry primary school and appropriate contributions towards an 
off-site secondary school and Special Education Needs (SEN);
iii) sufficient contributions towards enabling primary healthcare 
services to address patient growth associated with the 
development,   referring to the Infrastructure Delivery Plan;
iv) provision of convenience floorspace that meets the day-to-day 
needs of the local community only without impacting on the 
vitality and viability of existing centres in accordance with Policy 
TC2 – Retail Hierarchy;
v) all necessary transport improvements through direct mitigation 
or contributions to new and improved infrastructure,   referring to 
the Infrastructure Delivery Plan,   which is likely to include:
a. provision and contribution towards cycling and walking 
infrastructure and the public rights of way network on and 
off site ensuring the site is well connected to Oxford City,   
and appropriate surrounding villages;
b. contributions towards a scheme to improve the B480 route 
towards Cowley for buses,   pedestrians and cyclists;
c. provision of infrastructure/financial support for Eastern Arc-
Culham-Science Vale bus service;
d. contributions towards improvements to bus services along 
the B480 corridor and through the site to Oxford City and 
nearby villages; 
e. upgrades to the existing junctions on the Oxford Eastern 
bypass (A4142),   including Cowley junction.
vi) open space provision as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan;
vii) appropriate air quality mitigation measures to minimise impacts 
on the Oxford AQMA as demonstrated through an appropriate 
Air Quality Screening Assessment; and68
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
viii) low carbon development and renewable energy in accordance 
with STRAT4.
3. The proposed development at Northfield will deliver a scheme in 
accordance with an agreed comprehensive masterplan taking into 
consideration the indicative concept plan. The masterplan must 
be prepared in collaboration and agreed with the Local Planning 
Authority in consultation with Oxfordshire County Council and Oxford 
City Council. The proposals will be expected to deliver a masterplan 
that demonstrates: 
i) the delivery of a high-quality development that is fully 
integrated with its surroundings;
ii) appropriate landscape mitigation measures to minimise the 
visual impact of the development on the openness of the Green 
Belt and maintain important views of Oxford City,   providing 
a defensible Green Belt boundary and a strong countryside 
edge retaining a permanent separation between Oxford and 
Garsington;
iii) provision of a landscape led scheme which integrates a network 
of Green Infrastructure with structural landscaping along the 
north western boundary (Industrial Estate) that integrates and 
improves existing hedgerows and tree belts on the site;
iv) built development within Flood Zone 1 has site specific flood 
risk mitigation and management including implementation of 
sustainable surface water drainage measures. This should be 
informed by including appropriate on-site hydraulic modelling;
v) a net gain in biodiversity through the creation and restoration 
of habitats along the course of the Northfield Brook and 
biodiversity enhancements integrated into the masterplan with 
any residual impacts offset through a recognised biodiversity 
offsetting scheme; 
vi) the delivery of higher density development (a minimum of 
70 dph) along key transport corridors,   adjacent to the local 
centre,   and towards the north western boundary of the site,  
but having regard to the existing noise environment from the 
adjacent employment site,   to respond to the existing adjacent 
development,   gradually reducing the scale and density of 
development to provide a transition across the site towards the 
eastern and south-eastern countryside edges where the lower 
density development should be delivered,   alongside a network 
of Green Infrastructure to create an appropriate urban edge,   to 
deliver an overall site-wide average net density of 50-70 dph; 
vii) high quality walking and cycling routes within the site; andSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202069
viii) provision of infrastructure to support public transport through 
the site.
4. Archaeological evaluation will need to be undertaken ahead of the 
determination of any planning application in order to assess the 
significance of deposits in line with the NPPF. A scheme of appropriate 
mitigation will be required following this evaluation including the 
physical preservation of significant archaeological features and their 
setting where appropriate. 
5. The number and phasing of homes to be permitted and the timing 
of housing delivery linked to the planned infrastructure needs to 
be informed by further evidence as per the requirements of other 
policies in the Plan including Policy TRANS4. This will be agreed (and 
potentially conditioned) through the planning application process,  in 
consultation with the relevant statutory authority.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.
Land North of Bayswater Brook
3.106  Land north of Bayswater Brook directly adjoins the eastern boundary of Oxford 
City. The site was previously located entirely within the Oxford Green Belt, 
however the Council took into account the government’s policy in the NPPF 
relating to the Green Belt, and concluded that exceptional circumstances 
existed to inset this site from the Green Belt. The exceptional circumstances for 
doing this are:
• The site’s proximity to major employment locations and a wide range of 
services and facilities means that there is high potential to support travel 
by walking and cycling;
• The site is well positioned to connect with public transport provision in 
Oxford City; and
• The development of this site will help to provide for Oxford City’s unmet 
housing need, including affordable housing need, close to where that 
need arises.
3.107  A designated Oxford view cone lies directly to the west of the site and is 
comprised of a highly sensitive landscape, with views to and from Oxford 
City’s historic core, as well as having strong connections with surrounding 
countryside. The sensitive areas located to the west and north of the site are 
not included within the allocation, as they are considered to be of particular 70
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020significance to Oxford’s historic setting. Development should be focused on 
the lower lying ground on the south and east of the site, which has a greater 
likelihood to accommodate acceptable development in landscape terms, as it 
is less visible from the wider area and has higher potential for mitigation to be 
achieved. 
3.108  Development focused on the lower lying ground on the south and east of the 
site must be sensitive to the listed buildings within and surrounding the site, 
including their setting, as well as being sensitive to the site’s archaeological 
potential. Appropriate detailed landscape and visual impact assessments and 
heritage impact assessments that demonstrate how harm to heritage assets, 
landscape and Oxford’s historic setting will be avoided must be provided as 
part of any planning application.
3.109  A designated Oxford view cone lies directly to the west of the site. This area is 
identified for access only and is not proposed to be inset from the Green Belt. 
Other built development within the Oxford viewcone would harm the rural 
nature of this historic view. The layout and design of access arrangements in 
this area should be sensitive to the Oxford view cone.
3.110  Sidlings Copse and College Pond SSSI and Wick Copse Ancient Woodland are 
located directly to the north of the site. These are fragile sites comprising rare 
habitats which could suffer under increased visitor pressure. Other potential 
indirect impacts of development, such as impacts on hydrology and air 
pollution and nutrient deposition, also need to be considered and managed. 
The masterplanning of any development here should take into account the 
recommendations of the Council’s Ecological Assessment10 and a detailed 
hydrological assessment to understand the developments effects on the SSSI 
must be completed prior to masterplanning.
3.111  The Bayswater Brook runs along the south of the site. Areas of Flood Zone 2 
and 3 should be preserved as accessible green space, with built development 
restricted to Flood Zone 1. 
3.112  The Bayswater Brook is designated as a Site of Local Importance to Nature 
Conservation in the Oxford City Local Plan. Existing habitats associated with 
the brook should be protected and opportunities for enhancement should 
be pursued. The adjoining Barton Park development proposes a linear park 
alongside the Bayswater Brook as a buffer between the watercourse and 
built development. There is an opportunity to mirror this with complementary 
provision on this site.

the A40 is a major physical barrier to connectivity, particularly in terms of 
walking and cycling. Development would need to provide on-site and off-
site pedestrian, cycle and public transport connections to Oxford city centre 
and other key employment locations (such as the John Radcliffe Hospital and 
Oxford Science and Business Parks). 
3.114  Road capacity to the east of Oxford is already under significant pressure, 
particularly along the A40 and the Headington roundabout. Having first taken 
into account the mitigating effects of the sustainable transport improvements 
required by the policy, any significant residual impacts from the development 
on the surrounding highway network, including the A40 and Headington 
Roundabout, may give rise to a requirement for improvements to the 
Headington roundabout and its approaches (including bus priority measures); 
or grade separation of the Headington Roundabout; or a new link road 
between the A40/ B4150/ Marsh Lane junction and the A40 between the 
Thornhill Park and Ride junction and the Church Hill junction for Forest Hill. 
The provision of any additional highway capacity should be suitably phased to 
meet the increase in traffic demand arising from the Land North of Bayswater 
Brook site as and when it is likely to impact on the highway network, so as to 
discourage a general increase in car usage (including from the development) 
through the early provision of significant levels of additional traffic capacity. 
If more detailed evidence indicates that the required mitigation is a new 
link road, land will need to be identified and secured for delivery of this in 
consultation with the landowners and the County Council. There is currently 
insufficient road capacity to support new, direct road access between the site 
and the A40 west of the Barton Park site. Therefore, it is anticipated that the 
main access for the site will come via a remodelling of the Marston interchange 
with an additional access onto Bayswater Road which will be improved so that 
the access is safe. Where necessary, this may include adjoining land outside of 
the allocation.  
3.115  The English Indices of Deprivation 2015 identified the adjoining area of Barton 
as being within the 20% most deprived areas in England. Barton is identified 
as a priority regeneration area in the Oxford City Local Plan. Development 
at Land North of Bayswater Brook has potential to support regeneration 
aspirations for Barton by increasing the viability of and contributing to the 
improvement of existing services and facilities and by providing new accessible 
services and facilities.
3.116  The site is located in an area of archaeological interest, within an area of 
a known Roman settlement. Deposits include the line of a possible Roman 
road as well as a number of possible Roman settlement sites. Land North of 72
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Bayswater Brook is also immediately adjacent to the site of Headington Wick 
Roman Villa. Any surviving aspects of the Headington Wick Roman Villa site 
or related high status Roman settlement could be considered to be of similar 
significance to a scheduled monument. 
3.117  The Grade II* listed Wick Farmhouse Well House is located within the site 
boundary. This listed building is currently included on Historic England’s 
Heritage at Risk Register. Development at Land North of Bayswater Brook 
provides an opportunity to improve the condition of this listed building.
Policy STRAT13: Land North of Bayswater Brook
Site area: 110 hectares 
1. Land within the strategic allocation at Land North of Bayswater Brook 
will be developed to deliver approximately 1,100 new homes and 
supporting services and facilities within the plan period.
2. Proposals to develop Land North of Bayswater Brook will be expected 
to deliver:
i) affordable housing provision and mix in accordance with Policy South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202073
H9;
ii) sufficient educational capacity likely to be a 1.5-form entry 
primary school including early years provision,   appropriate 
contributions towards an off-site secondary school and Special 
Educational Needs (SEN);
iii) sufficient contributions towards enabling primary healthcare 
services to address patient growth associated with the 
development,   as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan;
iv) provision of convenience floorspace that meets the day-to-day 
needs of the local community only without impacting on the 
vitality and viability of existing centres in accordance with Policy 
TC2 – Retail Hierarchy;
v) necessary facilities for movement. As a first priority,   these should 
provide high quality pedestrian,   cycle and public transport 
connections into Oxford to maximise the number of trips 
made by non-car modes,   and measures to discourage car-based 
development. If,   having taken the impact of these measures into 
account,   significant residual impacts on the highway network 
are still predicted,   new highway infrastructure will be required 
to mitigate those impacts. Any planning application will be 
expected to be accompanied by a Transport Assessment and 
Travel Plan. Transport improvements are likely to include:
a. provision of high quality pedestrian,   cycle and public transport 
access and connectivity to Oxford City Centre and other major 
employment locations,   particularly the hospitals and Oxford 
Science and Business Parks,   including (but not limited to) the 
links to and across the A40 Oxford Northern Bypass and a new 
pedestrian and cycle bridge across the A40 which will require 
a suitable landing point outside of the allocated site;
b. road access from the surrounding road network;
c. measures to mitigate any significant residual impacts on the 
highway network,   first taking into account the benefits from 
the sustainable movement measures described above.
vi) a schedule of works as agreed with the Council for the repair of 
the Grade II* Wick Farm Wellhouse identified on the Heritage 
at Risk Register. This is to be agreed prior to the determination 
of an application for development. An application for planning 
permission must be accompanied by an application for listed 
building consent for the works to the Wellhouse; 
vii) a development that ensures that there will be no demonstrable 
negative recreational,   hydrological or air quality impacts on the 
Sidlings Copse and College Pond SSSI;
viii) appropriate air quality mitigation measures to minimise impacts 74
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
on the Oxford AQMA as demonstrated through an appropriate 
Air Quality Screening Assessment; and
ix) low carbon development and renewable energy in accordance 
with STRAT4.
3. The proposed development at Land North of Bayswater Brook will 
deliver a scheme in accordance with an agreed comprehensive 
masterplan taking into consideration this policy’s indicative concept 
plan. The masterplan must be prepared in collaboration and agreed 
with the Local Planning Authority in consultation with Oxfordshire 
County Council and Oxford City Council. Proposals will be required to 
deliver a masterplan that has been informed by detailed landscape,   
visual,   heritage and ecological impact assessments and demonstrates 
an appropriate scale,   layout and form that:
i) focuses built development within Flood Zone 1 only,   with areas 
of Flood Zone 2 and 3 preserved as accessible green space;
ii) includes a landscape buffer between the development and Wick 
Farm,   as well as incorporating high quality design to preserve 
or enhance listed buildings and their settings,   both within and 
surrounding the site,   in accordance with Policy ENV7;
iii) develops a transport and movement hierarchy which promotes 
non-car modes of travel and permeability across the site and 
beyond to Oxford City,   including on and off-site public rights 
of way enhancements,   and identifies where on-site highways 
infrastructure will be required,   ensures appropriate highways 
and sustainable transport access and permeability across the site,  
including between Bayswater Road and the B4150 Marsh Lane/
A40 junction; 
iv) provides a permanent defensible Green Belt boundary around 
the allocation and a strong countryside edge;
v) retains and incorporates existing hedgerows and tree belts,  
particularly where this assists with the creation of a new Green 
Belt boundary;
vi) relates to and connects with adjoining built development and 
development that is planned within Oxford City;
vii) respects and avoids harm to Oxford’s historic setting;
viii) minimises visual impacts on the surrounding countryside;
ix) delivers higher density development (a minimum of 45 dph) 
along key frontages,   transport corridors and towards the south 
and east boundaries of the main site and the south of the 
smaller site,   to respond to the existing adjacent development,  
provided it does not adversely impact any heritage assets or 
their settings,   and provided that it respects the character of,   and South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202075
living conditions within,   neighbouring residential development. 
This will be interspersed with green links and public access to 
attractive walking routes. Densities on both sites will gradually 
reduce towards the northern landscape buffer and on the main 
site,   densities will be lower close to Sidlings Copse and College 
Pond SSSI and also reduce towards the western edge of the site 
to reflect the sensitivities of the view cone;
x) a net gain in biodiversity through the protection and 
enhancement of habitats along the Bayswater Brook,   new 
habitats to the north buffering the Sidlings Copse and College 
Pond SSSI and offsite biodiversity enhancements;
xi) provides a network of Green Infrastructure that:
a. retains and incorporates areas of functional flood plain and 
existing surface water flow paths; 
b. protects and enhances existing habitats,   particularly those 
associated with Sidlings Copse and College Pond SSSI and 
the Bayswater Brook;
c. connects with adjoining Green Infrastructure within Oxford 
City;
d. retains and incorporates existing public rights of way,  
improves and extends public rights of way where 
appropriate,   and supports movement through the site and 
into adjoining areas by walking and cycling; and
e. provides an appropriate buffer to the Oxford view cone.
4. Archaeological evaluation was undertaken during 2020 before the 
preparation of the masterplan. A scheme of appropriate mitigation 
should be established,   to include the physical preservation of 
significant archaeological features and their setting.
5. The number and phasing of homes to be permitted and the timing 
of housing delivery linked to the planned infrastructure need to 
be informed by further evidence as per the requirements of other 
policies in the Plan including Policy TRANS4. This will be agreed (and 
potentially conditioned) through the planning application process,   in 
consultation with the relevant statutory authority.

This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.76
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020Wheatley Neighbourhood 
Development Plan
3.118  Wheatley is the only Larger Village which is inset from the Green Belt where 
a Neighbourhood Development Plan is being prepared. According to current 
national planning guidance, a NDP can make detailed amendments to the 
Green Belt boundary where the Local Planning Authority sets the need. The 
Council is committed to supporting Wheatley and their ambitions for their 
Neighbourhood Development Plan. Within two years of the adoption of the 
Local Plan, the Wheatley Neighbourhood Plan will release land from the Green 
Belt, to enable the allocation of land for mixed use development.
3.119  The inset boundary at Wheatley is drawn tightly around the built edge of 
development. There are limited opportunities to redevelop existing land 
within the inset boundary and the removal of Green Belt would enable new 
development to take place at this village. The Green Belt Study found that the 
land immediately adjacent to the eastern built up edge of Wheatley has few 
essential characteristics of the Green Belt.
3.120  The exceptional circumstances for the NDP to release the land at Wheatley are 
as follows:
• to support the Neighbourhood Development Plan and to ensure that 
future allocations can be made through the NDP;
• Wheatley is a Larger Village and benefits from a number of services and 
facilities and represents an appropriate location for accommodating 
additional development; and
• the location of this land is recognised to be positioned between existing 
residential development to the west and industrial buildings to the east 
and has limited essential characteristics of the Green Belt.
Land at Wheatley Campus
3.121  The Local Plan has inset Wheatley Campus from the Green Belt. The site is 
adjacent to the village of Wheatley which is already largely inset from the Green 
Belt. The existing development within the site has compromised the site’s 
openness and countryside character, and the site is well contained and too close 
to Wheatley to play any significant role in the setting or special character of 
Oxford City. The exceptional circumstances justifying a review of the Green Belt 
through the Local Plan in this area are:There are limited 
opportunities 
to redevelop 
existing land 
within the inset 
boundarySouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202077• There are opportunities for the site to be well connected to surrounding 
settlements, particularly the major urban area of Oxford City, by public 
transport and cycling;
• To inset the site from the Green Belt will enable the most efficient use to 
be made of a partially previously developed site;
• There are limited alternatives for accommodating additional development 
at Wheatley other than through Green Belt release; and
• The redevelopment of the site will provide new homes, helping to meet 
identified housing needs, including affordable housing needs.
3.122  The site was granted outline planning permission for up to 500 dwellings. 
Housing on this site could help sustain current bus service provision on the 
A40/Oxford corridor and other village facilities. The A40 is a potential barrier 
to movement by sustainable modes; there will be a need for good cycle and 
walking links to the village centre and primary school to encourage active 
and healthy travel. Improved cycle links to Oxford City will also be needed 
to encourage travel to employment, further education and other services by 
sustainable modes.
3.123  The site includes a range of existing buildings situated predominantly on the 
eastern side, including a 10 storey tower block. There is an opportunity to 
deliver a more sensitive development that responds positively to the heritage 
assets nearby and the surrounding countryside.
3.124  The north-western, undeveloped part of the site is particularly sensitive in  
heritage terms. There is a scheduled monument within this part of the site.  
There are trees within the site, a high number of which are the subject of a 
Tree Preservation Order. It is also possible that archaeological deposits may 
survive within the less disturbed parts of the site.  Higher density development 
should therefore be located in the eastern and central parts of the site with 
lower density development in the south western part.
3.125  This site includes a number of playing pitches and this level of provision should 
be maintained and a wider community use should be explored through any 
planning application.
3.126  There is a need for smaller scale accessible green space (between 2 and 20 
hectares) in the north of Wheatley. Development at the Wheatley Campus site 
provides an opportunity to deliver new smaller scale accessible green space 
alongside new homes.

within the proposal.
Policy STRAT14: Land at Wheatley Campus, Oxford 
Brookes University
Site area: 21 hectares
1. Land within the strategic allocation at Wheatley Campus will be 
developed to deliver approximately 500 new homes within the plan 
period. Higher density development should be located in the eastern 
and central parts of the site with lower density development in the 
south western part. 
2. Proposals to develop land at Wheatley Campus will be expected to 
deliver:
i) affordable housing provision and mix in accordance with Policy 
H9;
ii) development densities in accordance with Policy STRAT5;
iii) any necessary contributions to enhance local school capacity 
arising from the proposal;
iv) all necessary transport infrastructure including:
a. improvements to walking and cycling provision;
b. contribution to Public Transport provision; 
c. Travel Plan monitoring.
v) a programme of archaeological evaluation and mitigation to be 
undertaken ahead of any development;
vi) appropriate landscaping,   including buffers along the A40 and an 
appropriate countryside edge; and
vii)  low carbon development and renewable energy where  
compatible with the terms of the outline planning permission.
3. The proposed development at Wheatley Campus will deliver a scheme 
in accordance with an agreed comprehensive masterplan. Proposals 
will be required to deliver a masterplan that demonstrates:
i) visual impacts on surrounding countryside has been minimised;
ii) valuable individual specimen trees,   avenue and groups of trees 
and native vegetation are retained and respected;
iii) surrounding listed buildings and structures (in particular Holton 
Park) and their setting are conserved and enhanced; South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202079
iv) an appropriate buffer and setting to Scheduled Monuments 
within the site (the moated site 580m south west of Church 
Farm); and 
v)  appropriate biodiversity measures in accordance with the NPPF.
4. Existing sports facilities should be retained or replaced within 
the development or,   where this is not achievable because of site 
constraints,   replacement facilities should be provided close to 
Wheatley or Holton to ensure that there is no local deficit of quantity 
or quality created by the redevelopment of the site.
5. The Wheatley Campus site is removed from the Green Belt and inset 
as shown in Land inset from the Green Belt (Appendix 4).
6. Appropriate biodiversity measures in accordance with the NPPF.

Wallingford
Introduction
3.136  Wallingford is the smallest market town in the district, with a population 
of around 8,000. Wallingford is an important local service centre for the 
surrounding villages providing retail, education, health, sports and leisure 
facilities. Wallingford has a long and rich history that is reflected in its urban 
form and open spaces. Of particular significance are Wallingford Castle and the 
castle gardens and meadows. Wallingford has a good range of independent 
shops, antique shops and eateries. Events such as Bunkfest, the heritage 
railway and the town being used as the setting for a number of television 
programmes, attract visitors.
3.137  Wallingford’s strengths:
• Riverside setting with excellent opportunities for enjoying the river Thames
• Access to the surrounding Chilterns and North Wessex Downs Areas of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty
• Well preserved historic features including a compact medieval centre
• Attractive market place that holds regular markets
• Wallingford Castle and Meadows
• A good range of facilities in terms of schools, health and recreation
• A range of employment opportunities
• A number of independent shops and restaurants
• A calendar of events that draws visitors to the town, including markets, 
festivals and rowing events.
3.138  The Wallingford Neighbourhood Development Plan is currently under 
preparation and will contain planning policies for the town. When made, it 
will form part of the Development Plan for South Oxfordshire. The Council South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202083
83encourages landowners to discuss development proposals with the Town 
Council and neighbourhood planning group to attain support for the scheme, 
if possible, prior to submitting a planning application.
3.139  Specific policies relating to housing, employment and retail for Wallingford are 
covered in Chapters 4 (Delivering New Homes), 5 (Employment and Economy) 
and 9 (Ensuring the Vitality of Town Centres) of this Plan.
Policy WAL1: The Strategy for Wallingford
1. Neighbourhood Development Plans are expected to,   and the Council 
will support development proposals that:
i) deliver homes in accordance with Policy H3;
ii) support measures that improve the attraction of Wallingford 
for visitors with emphasis on the River Thames and the towns’ 
heritage;
iii) support the market place as a focal hub;
iv) improve accessibility,   car and cycle parking,   pedestrian and cycle 
links;
v) provide new employment opportunities and improve the stock 
of existing employment areas;
vi) support schemes that enhance the town’s natural and historic 
environment and conserve and enhance the town’s heritage 
assets;
vii) address air quality issues in the town centre; and
viii) provide new,   or enhanced community facilities that meet an 
identified need.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.

South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202085DELIVERING NEW HOMES
4.1 One of our main objectives of this Plan is to deliver new homes in places where 
people want to live and that they can afford. In Chapter 3: Our Spatial Strategy 
it sets out where these houses will go in a sustainable and achievable manner 
that meets our spatial strategy. This chapter provides details of the houses 
built so far and provides a forecast of future house building in the district. This 
chapter also contains policy direction for Neighbourhood Development Plans 
and a contingency if they fail to deliver, and polices for affordable housing, our 
preferred tenure mix and policies for infilling, redevelopment and householder 
development.
Sources of Housing Supply
4.2 The NPPF directs us to significantly boost the supply of housing. This means we 
need to consider not only the number of homes that we are planning for, but 
ensuring the homes come forward at the right pace to meet demand. The NPPF 
recognises the role that small and medium sized sites can play in achieving 
quicker housing delivery, a point that is also reiterated in the Letwin Review of 
Build-Out Rates11. Our strategy reflects this, and we have sought to rely on a 
mix of site sizes to best ensure a robust supply of housing throughout the plan 
period. 
4.3 The housing supply in this Plan is made up from a diverse set of sources: 
• Strategic allocations made in this Plan
• Retained Core Strategy and Local Plan 2011 allocations
• Existing planning commitments
• Small scale (non-strategic sites) to be identified though Neighbourhood 
Development Plans or identified in this Plan where Neighbourhood 
Development Plans are not being progressed
• Sites not yet identified that will come forward through the development 
management process in accordance with the policies in this Plan, known 
as windfalls.

85South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202086
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 20204.4 The allocations within this Plan are largely on strategic development sites 
except for allocations at Nettlebed, and would not fall within the definition 
of a smaller or medium sites. However, the Council’s supply of housing does 
include a significant proportion of sites on less than 1ha, and on other smaller 
sites of less than 100 homes. We expect these smaller sites to deliver quicker 
than the larger strategic allocations. The sources of smaller housing sites are 
expected to be:
• Windfall and infill development which is permitted across all of our 
settlements 
• Sites allocated / to be allocated in Neighbourhood Development Plans 
4.5 We expect windfall development to take place in accordance with the 
Development Plan, which will focus speculative development to infill sites 
within settlements. Since 2011 we have delivered on average 145 dwellings 
per annum from windfall sites. We have taken a conservative approach to 
forecasting this forward and consider that 100 homes per year could be 
reasonably achieved. As this will be focused on infill sites within settlements, 
we expect most of these developments to be smaller housing sites. 
4.6 In South Oxfordshire we currently have 19 made Neighbourhood Development 
Plans. The majority of the sites allocated in these plans are on smaller sites, 
with only a handful of sites extending over 100 homes in total. 
4.7 However, the strategic allocations are still an important part of the delivery of 
the Local Plan and to the achievement of our vision and objectives. As set out 
in our spatial strategy chapter, we propose six large scale developments and a 
brownfield redevelopment opportunity. Together, these sites have a potential 
capacity for around 14,600 new homes. However, we do not expect these 
to all be built before 2035 and so the Local Plan only counts 11,785 homes 
towards the Plan requirement.
4.8 The Plan already made provision for around 16,360 new homes through the 
rolling forward of allocations in our adopted Core Strategy and the Local Plan 
2011, the commitments in made Neighbourhood Development Plans and the 
granting of planning permissions. 7,178 of these committed new homes have 
been built since 2011.
4.9 The previously allocated sites of the Core Strategy and Local Plan 2011 will 
continue to be saved within this Local Plan (some of these sites are currently 
under construction or complete, whilst others have yet to start).We expect 
windfall

4.12 Within South Oxfordshire, new housing will be planned in order to deliver 
the scale and distribution of housing development set out in Chapter 3: Our 
Spatial Strategy. Whilst the overall level of development required to support 
the existing and future needs of South Oxfordshire, and a proportion to 
assist Oxford City in meeting its commitments of the Growth Deal, amounts 
to 23,550 new homes, the Local Plan provides for development that 
exceeds these requirements. This provides additional flexibility to enable the 
management of our housing land supply trajectory going forwards and to 
respond to changing circumstances.
Policy H1: Delivering New Homes
1. Residential development (including general market housing and 
affordable housing within land use class C3,   specialist accommodation 
for older people within land use class C2 or use class C3,   and 
residential caravan and mobile home development) will be permitted 
at sites allocated or carried forward by this Plan and on sites South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202089
that are allocated by Neighbourhood Development Plans. Where 
Neighbourhood Development Plans are not progressed in Larger 
Villages and market towns,   planning applications will be considered 
against the housing delivery targets for the Towns and Larger Villages 
set out in this Plan.
2. The Development Plan contains a range of site types and sizes that 
will be developed with different time scales and that are dependent 
on different infrastructure. The Council has developed a detailed 
development trajectory (shown at Appendix 8) that will provide the 
annual delivery targets for this plan period.
3. Residential development on sites not allocated in the Development 
Plan will only be permitted where:
i) it is for affordable housing on a rural exception site or entry 
level housing scheme; or
ii) it is for specialist housing for older people in locations with good 
access to public transport and local facilities; or
iii) it is development within the existing built-up areas of Towns 
and Larger Villages as defined in the settlement hierarchy 
(shown in Appendix 7); provided an important open space of 
public,  environmental,   historical or ecological value is not lost,   
nor an important public view harmed; or
iv) it is infilling,   and brownfield sites within Smaller and Other 
Villages as defined in the settlement hierarchy; or
v) it is brought forward through a Community Right to Build Order; 
or
vi) there are other specific exceptions/circumstances defined in 
a Neighbourhood Development Plan and/or Neighbourhood 
Development Orders; or
vii) it would bring redundant or disused buildings into residential 
use and would enhance its immediate surroundings; or 
viii)  the design is outstanding or innovative and of exceptional 
quality and would significantly enhance its immediate setting.
4. The residential development of previously developed land will be 
permitted within and adjacent to the existing built-up areas of Towns,  
Larger Villages and Smaller Villages. The Council will also support 
appropriate opportunities to remediate despoiled,   degraded,   derelict,  
contaminated or unstable land.
5. Proposals that will bring empty housing back into residential use will 
be encouraged.90
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
6. The Council will support development which provides for the 
residential needs of all parts of our community,   including Gypsies,  
Travellers,   Travelling Showpeople,   caravan dwellers and boat 
dwellers. Proposals for new residential caravan and mobile home sites 
to accommodate people who do not meet the planning definition for 
Gypsies and Travellers set out in Planning Policy for Traveller Sites 
2015,   or legacy definition,   will be considered in accordance with this 
policy. Planning permission for single residential caravans or mobile 
homes will only be given in exceptional circumstances and on a 
temporary and personal basis.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 & 8.
Didcot
Policy H2: New Housing in Didcot
1. At Didcot,   provision will be made for around 6,399* new homes 
between 2011 and 2035. This provision will be at:
Location  Indicative dwelling capacity
Ladygrove East (saved from the Local Plan 2011) (H2a) 642
Didcot North East (saved from the Core Strategy) (H2b) 2,030
Great Western Park (saved from the Local Plan 2011) (H2c) 2,587
Vauxhall Barracks (saved from the Core Strategy) (H2d) 300
Orchard Centre Phase II remaining site (saved from Core Strategy) (H2e) 300
New: Didcot Gateway (H2f) 300
New: Hadden Hill (H2g) 74
New: Land south of A4130 (H2h) 166
Total  6,339 
*Some of the dwellings proposed in Policy H2 have already been completed 
since 2011 and some are on sites that have planning consent (including 
outline planning permission or with a resolution to grant permission).
2. Land within the allocation at Ladygrove East will be developed to 
deliver approximately 642 new homes. Proposals will be expected to 
deliver a network of public urban spaces and public greenspaces (not South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202091
less than 8 hectares) with the largest greenspace comprising a local 
park (not less than 6 hectares) containing an equipped children’s play 
area,   open grassland,   woodland,   wetland,   ponds and watercourses 
located in the southwestern part of the allocated area. Other 
greenspaces will comprise green corridors in the movement network 
and buffer zones,   containing open grassland,   earth mounding and 
woodland. The buffer zones will be of sufficient width to protect 
homes from noise generated on major distributor roads and to protect 
road users from the Hadden Hill golf course.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 6 & 7.
4.13 The supply of sites to deliver around 6,399 homes at Didcot is shown in Policy 
H2. All development will be expected to be delivered following the Masterplan 
Principles of the Didcot Garden Town set out in Policy STRAT3 and figure 1. 
Some of the sites in the centre of Didcot have the potential to deliver at a 
higher density than shown here – and hence these are indicative numbers of 
homes – but this will be further explored through the work on the delivery 
of the Garden Town, where opportunity sites around Orchard Centre Phase 
II, Rich’s Sidings, Broadway the Jubilee Roundabout and Didcot Gateway are 
expected to be developed.
Market Towns 
4.14 In each of the towns of Henley-on-Thames, Thame and Wallingford the Local 
Plan proposes the provision of an additional 15% growth of housing stock in 
addition to existing commitments from the Core Strategy. This level of growth 
has been calculated on the basis of the housing stock as at 2011- the base 
date of the Local Plan. The Plan is planning positively for further growth over 
the remainder of the plan period. This will be delivered in accordance with 
Policy H3. The NDP, or review of the made NDP, for each town must explore 
opportunities to address local needs and provide allocations to meet or exceed 
the minimum requirements in Policy H3.
4.15  Growth needs to be balanced with the social, economic and environmental 
factors that may impact upon the ability of settlements to accommodate 
the amount of development that has been calculated. Consideration of the 
availability of suitable and deliverable sites may also impact on how much 
development a settlement may accommodate. Ultimately a detailed evidence 
base will need to be provided to support each Neighbourhood Development 92
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020Plan and its assessment of land availability, infrastructure delivery and 
landscape capacity, to meet the figures provided in Table 4d: Provision of 
homes at market towns. The figures provide housing requirements for the 
neighbourhood plans which reflects the overall strategy for the pattern and 
scale of development and for making any relevant allocations. The identified 
figures also provide a guide for infrastructure providers to ensure necessary 
infrastructure is available at the right time and that growth is sustainable. 
Much infrastructure in the market towns serves a wider hinterland, and 
cumulative needs should be assessed. In many areas this will mean a step 
change in infrastructure provision. Neighbourhood planning groups will need 
to cooperate with infrastructure providers and statutory consultees to provide 
this evidence, and develop viable solutions for any infrastructure provision that 
is needed.
4.16 On the basis of 15% dwelling growth from 2011 and the requirements from 
the Core Strategy the following minimum numbers of houses are expected 
to be built in the plan period. These numbers take into account existing 
commitments and completions and identify the following minimum remaining 
levels of development to be delivered.

Policy H3: Housing in the Towns of Henley-on-Thames, 
Thame and Wallingford
1. A minimum housing requirement of 3,873 homes will be collectively 
delivered in the towns of Henley-on-Thames,   Thame and Wallingford 
as follows:
i) Henley-on-Thames: at least 1,285 homes 
ii) Thame: at least 1,518 homes 
iii) Wallingford: at least 1,070 homes
2. Neighbourhood Development Plans for the market towns should 
seek to meet demonstrable local needs,   for example for specialist or 
affordable housing,   even where this would result in housing provision 
in excess of the outstanding requirement shown in Table 4d.
3. Land within the allocation at West of Wallingford will be developed to 
deliver approximately 555 new homes. Proposals will be expected to 
deliver: 
i) Access from the western bypass,   with no vehicular access 
provided through Queen’s Avenue and the discouragement of 
traffic from entering the Wallingford AQMA;
ii) The western and southern boundaries are reinforced with 
significant landscape buffers,   with no built development along 
the western boundary adjacent to the bypass. 
 
4. If a Neighbourhood Development Plan has not adequately progressed 
with allocating sites* to meet these requirements within 12 months of 
adoption of this Local Plan,   planning applications for housing in that 
market town will be supported provided that proposals comply with 
the remainder of the policies in this Development Plan.
* the Plan has reached submission stage and has allocated sufficient housing 
sites. 
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 & 7.94
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020Larger Villages
4.17 The Local Plan proposes the provision of 15% growth in the Larger Villages. This 
level of growth has been calculated using the existing housing stock as it was at 
2011 - the base date of the Local Plan and is on top of Core Strategy allocations 
where these exist. The Larger Villages have already collectively delivered 14% 
growth in housing based on completed dwellings between 1 April 2011 and 31 
March 2020. The Plan is therefore planning positively for further growth over the 
remainder of the plan period. This will ensure that these places continue to grow 
and support the services and facilities that sustain them.
4.18 Development in the Larger Villages should be proportional, appropriate 
and dependent on existing infrastructure. It is considered that the most 
appropriate mechanism for delivering housing in larger villages is by preparing a 
Neighbourhood Development Plan and allocating development sites. 
4.19 This level of growth will support local services and facilities and result in a 
sustainable and balanced distribution of development. Where Larger Villages 
are in the process of preparing a Neighbourhood Development Plan, the 
delivery of the houses allocated to these villages should be provided for by the 
Neighbourhood Development Plan. This enables communities to have their say 
on where development in their area will go.
4.20 Where a Larger Village already has an adopted Neighbourhood Development 
Plan which does not provide for their level of allocated housing development, 
this will need to be reviewed within the specified timeframe as set out in Policy 
H4.
4.21 As Nettlebed is not preparing a Neighbourhood Development Plan the Local Plan 
allocates sites in this village, and will continue to work with the local community 
and parish council to support this.
4.22 There are currently 12 settlements classed as Larger Villages in the district. 
These are:
 Table 4e: Larger Villages  
 Benson Cholsey Sonning Common   
Berinsfield Crowmarsh Gifford Watlington
 Chalgrove Goring-on-Thames Wheatley
 Chinnor Nettlebed WoodcoteSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020954.23 Eleven of these twelve villages are either in the process of preparing a 
Neighbourhood Development Plan, or already have a “made” plan. The 
Local Plan’s strategy for housing distribution in the Larger Villages is for each 
settlement to grow proportionally by around 15% from the 2011 base date, 
plus any housing allocated to that village through the Core Strategy.
4.24 At Berinsfield the Council is working closely with the community on an 
investment and regeneration scheme. It is expected that the remaining Larger 
Villages will allocate housing sites through their Neighbourhood Development 
Plans to meet their identified number of homes.
4.25 There are strategic allocations at Berinsfield, Chalgrove and Wheatley, and it is 
not expected that each of these villages would deliver additional growth over 
and above what is already planned for these strategic allocations. In addition, 
potential development in Berinsfield and Wheatley is restricted by the Green 
Belt. However, the Council does not want to suppress the appetite and hard 
work of the Neighbourhood Development Plan groups in these communities 
and the Council will continue to support appropriate proposals made through 
a robust and evidenced NDP.
4.26 In Benson and Chinnor a number of planning appeals have been allowed, 
therefore already achieving the minimum 15% growth level. However, both 
communities may wish to consider safeguarding sites that have been given 
permission to benefit from the full weight of their NDP and to provide them 
with a robust baseline for monitoring.
4.27 The achievement of the 15% growth figure needs to be balanced with the 
social, economic and environmental factors that may impact upon the ability 
of settlements to accommodate the amount of development that has been 
calculated. Consideration of the availability of suitable and deliverable sites 
may also impact on how much development a settlement may accommodate.
4.28 Some villages are constrained by factors such as Green Belt, Areas of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty, and Flood Zones. Where Neighbourhood 
Development Plans are considering sites within an AONB or sites that form part 
of the setting of an AONB, a Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment should 
be undertaken. In these villages a 15% growth may not be fully achievable. 
Other villages are unconstrained and can plan for more than 15% growth. 
The level of growth proposed should be evidenced within the Neighbourhood 
Development Plan with local communities helping to shape the development of 
their village. Ultimately the detailed evidence base will need to be provided to 
support each Neighbourhood Development Plan and its assessment of capacity, Some villages are

South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020whether this is to support a higher or lower number than that provided in 
Table 4f: Provision of homes at Larger Villages. Neighbourhood planning groups 
will need to cooperate with infrastructure providers and statutory consultees to 
provide this evidence, and develop viable solutions for any infrastructure provision 
that is needed.
4.29 The number of houses identified for each Larger Village in the ‘Core Strategy 
+15% growth’ column of Table 4f should be built in the plan period.
4.30 Table 4f differentiates between villages where this Local Plan makes allocations 
to either meet the village’s growth needs (due to them not preparing a 
Neighbourhood Development Plan) or where the Local Plan has proposed 
strategic allocations in Chapter 4. For villages where the Council is not making 
allocations in this Local Plan, the table identifies a housing requirement for them 
to be achieved either through Neighbourhood Development Plans or planning 
applications in accordance with Policy H4. The Council will support Larger 
Villages to allocate further development sites should the NDP so wish, where this 
level of growth is sustainable for that village, and where this is in accordance 
with national policies and guidance. These housing targets take into account the 
existing commitments and completions and identifies the following remaining 
levels of development to be delivered at each Larger Village.

Neighbourhood Planning
 
4.32 The Council strongly advocates neighbourhood planning and offers a range 
of support to neighbourhood planning groups. The Council firmly believe that 
Neighbourhood Development Plans have been proven to be an innovative 
and appropriate way to manage development at a local level. There has been 
great success in the district with preparing Neighbourhood Development Plans, 
and the Council is confident that this success will continue and that local led 
growth will support the overall spatial strategy of the Local Plan. In the event 
that a Neighbourhood Development Plan does not adequately progress with 
allocating site(s) for housing,the Local Plan has built in contingency measures.

4.32 Nettlebed, although the smallest of the Larger Villages, forms an important 
part of the network of settlements in the western area of the district along 
the A4130. It has a reasonable range of services including a primary school, 
doctor’s surgery, village hall, convenience shop and garage, post office and pub/
restaurant. It is also on the bus route, with an hourly service, being halfway 
between Wallingford and Henley-on-Thames. The village has a small historic 
core centred on the High Street with more modern housing development to the 
north. Nettlebed is entirely within the AONB and much of the land to the north 
and east is common land.
4.33 The community has decided not to prepare a Neighbourhood Development Plan 
and subsequently the Local Plan allocates sites on their behalf.

Site area: 0.76 hectares 
1. This allocation will be expected to deliver:
i) a residential development of approximately 11 dwellings;
ii) a scheme of an appropriate scale and form with landscaping that 
conserves and enhances the AONB;
iii) appropriate and safe means of access; and
iv) a scheme that protects existing landscape features,   including 
existing boundary vegetation,   and any ecological constraints.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 & 7.
4.34 Land to the west of Priest Close is a greenfield site on the edge of the village. 
The Council’s Landscape Assessment Update12 found that whilst the site lies 
within the Chilterns AONB, which makes it highly sensitive in its own right, the 
site is extremely well contained and relates well to the existing village edge. 
There is therefore some potential for sensitively designed small-scale residential 
development on the site, provided that the existing boundary vegetation is 
retained and, particularly on the southern boundary, strengthened.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 202099
Policy H6: Joyce Grove, Nettlebed
Site area: 10.9 hectares
1. This allocation will be expected to deliver:
i) a residential development of approximately 20 dwellings wholly 
within the existing listed building and associated buildings;
ii) a scheme of an appropriate scale and layout in a form that 
respects the listed building and its setting; and
iii) appropriate and safe means of access.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 & 7.
4.35 Joyce Grove comprises a substantial Grade II listed house and outbuildings 
within a parkland setting. Given this, it would not be suitable for new-
build housing, but it is considered that there is the potential to re-use and 
sympathetically convert existing buildings to provide some new homes. The 
site is currently occupied by Sue Ryder and operates as a hospice. It is a highly 
valued facility for southern Oxfordshire. The Council is aware that the building 
does not currently meets the occupier’s needs and that they have been 
exploring options to relocate. At this point in time an appropriate alternative 
site has yet to be identified and the Council does not expect that the homes 
will contribute towards Nettlebed’s housing supply until later in the plan 
period. 
Policy H7: Land to the South and West of Nettlebed 
Service Station
Site area: 1.3ha
1. This allocation will be expected to deliver:
i) a residential development of approximately 15 dwellings;
ii) a scheme of an appropriate scale and form including relevant 
landscaping to minimise the impact on the AONB; and
iii) appropriate and safe means of access.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 & 7.100
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
4.36 Land to the South and West of Nettlebed Service Station is a greenfield site on 
the western edge of the village. The landscape capacity study found that the 
site was not visually prominent and could accommodate some development. 
The site is in close proximity to the village providing access to a range of 
facilities and services.
Smaller Villages
Policy H8: Housing in the Smaller Villages
1. The Council will support development within the Smaller Villages in 
accordance with Policy H16. Where a Parish Council wishes to prepare 
a Neighbourhood Development Plan and make housing allocations 
within it to support further growth,   the Council will support this. 
2. Those Neighbourhood Development Plans will need to demonstrate 
that the level of growth they are planning for is commensurate to the 
scale and character of their village,   and this is expected to be around a 
5% to 10% increase in dwellings above the number of dwellings in the 
village in the 2011 census (minus any completions since 1 April 2011). 
3. Neighbourhood Development Plans allocating sites on greenfield sites 
in these locations should consider how development can meet the 
bespoke needs of their village,   including housing mix,   tenure and the 
amount of affordable housing.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2 & 3.
4.37 Smaller Villages, as defined in the settlement hierarchy (Appendix 7), have 
no defined requirement to contribute towards delivering additional housing 
(beyond windfall and infill development) to meet the overall housing 
requirement of South Oxfordshire. There is a sufficient supply of housing from 
strategic allocations and from existing planning permissions, which means 
that the less sustainable settlements will not be required to offset the housing 
requirement. However some parishes may still wish to proceed with preparing 
a Neighbourhood Development Plan for example to achieve the protection 
afforded by allocating housing to fund projects they want to deliver or they 
would like to identify a specific type of housing bespoke to their village’s 
needs. The Council’s strategy therefore allows them to do so, provided that the 
levels of growth are commensurate to the size of the village. South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020101
4.38 Proposals in a Neighbourhood Development Plan must be in conformity with 
the strategic policies in this Plan, and policies in the NPPF. This Local Plan does 
not set down a requirement for Smaller Villages in the Green Belt to deliver 
additional housing and as such, Smaller Villages would not be expected to 
propose alterations to the Green Belt through Neighbourhood Development 
Plans.
Other Villages
4.39  It is not generally expected that those settlements classified as “Other Villages” 
will provide a significant source of housing supply, However, it is possible that 
some development proposals may come forward over the plan period in these 
villages, such as single dwellings, infilling and conversions from other uses. Such 
proposals will be considered against the relevant policies in this Local Plan.
4.40 Some of the Other Villages may wish to prepare Neighbourhood Development 
Plans and we will support them to bring these forward in the same way that the 
Council would support their preparation in Smaller Villages.
Affordable Housing
4.41 The starting position for the provision of affordable housing is outlined in Policy 
H9. Policy H9 is supplemented by a robust evidence base demonstrating the 
viability of its requirements.
4.42 The affordable housing should meet required standards and should be of a size 
and type which meets the requirements of those in housing need.
Policy H9: Affordable Housing 
1. The Council will seek affordable housing contributions in accordance 
with the criteria set out below: 
• 40% affordable housing on all sites with a net gain of 10 or more 
dwellings (Use Class C3) or where the site has an area of 0.5 
hectares or more; and 
•  40% affordable housing in respect of all developments within 
Use Class C2 where the site is delivering a net gain of 10 or more 
self-contained units; and
• within the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB): 40% 102
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
affordable housing on all sites with a net gain of five or more 
dwellings or where the site has an area of 0.5 hectares or more.
 For proposals of less than 10 homes in the AONB,   this will be 
sought as a financial contribution; and
• on sites adjacent to Oxford City: 50% affordable housing on all 
sites with a net gain of 10 or where the site has an area of 0.5 
hectares or more.
2. Proposals where affordable housing is required should have regard to 
the following: 
i) in circumstances where it can be adequately demonstrated that 
the level of affordable housing being sought would be unviable,  
alternative tenure mixes and levels of affordable housing 
provision,   may be considered;
ii) in cases where the 40% calculation provides a part dwelling,   a 
financial contribution will be sought equivalent to that part 
residential unit;
iii) the Council will expect a tenure mix of 40% affordable rented,  
35% social rented and 25% other affordable routes to home 
ownership with the exception of Land at Berinsfield Garden 
Village (see specific tenure considerations in Policy STRAT10i);
iv) with the exception of part dwellings,   the affordable housing 
should be provided on site and the affordable housing should be 
mixed with the market housing;
v) the affordable housing should meet required standards and 
should be of a size and type which meets the requirements of 
those in housing need;
vi) affordable housing should be indistinguishable in appearance 
from market housing on site and distributed evenly across the 
site,   with these units being clustered in groups of no more than 
15 homes; and
vii) to prevent the artificial subdivision of sites with the same 
landowner,   where land is subdivided to create separate 
development schemes that cumulatively meet the thresholds 
of this policy,   the Council will consider the site as a whole and 
will seek affordable housing on each part. The Council will 
also consider the site as a whole where a developer seeks to 
amalgamate adjacent sites with the same landowner into a 
single development thereby meeting the threshold.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4 & 6.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 20201034.43 Affordable housing includes social rented / affordable rented and intermediate 
housing that is available to households in the district whose needs are not met 
by the market. Other intermediate housing will be delivered in accordance with 
the definition in the National Planning Policy Framework. The cost must be low 
enough for eligible households to afford based on local incomes and house 
prices. 
4.44 The exact amount of affordable housing and tenure mix on each site will 
be agreed through negotiation between developers and South Oxfordshire 
District Council, and Policy H9 will be the starting position.  The Council’s 
current housing strategy, and where relevant and appropriate, local housing 
needs surveys including Oxfordshire County Council Children and Education 
Service needs surveys, will inform these negotiations. A request for a departure 
from the policy by a planning applicant is expected to be supported by 
robust evidence, including viability assessments. Lower levels of affordable 
housing provision or an alternative tenure mix will be acceptable where 
this is justified on viability grounds. The Council will monitor the delivery of 
affordable housing through Policy H9 and review the Housing Delivery Strategy 
periodically to ensure that the aim to provide a healthy mix of houses is 
fulfilled.
4.45 In regard to accommodation classified as C2, or housing developments that 
seek to address the needs of the elderly, the Council will seek affordable 
housing contributions from developments that provide for 10 or more self-
contained units. The Council defines a self-contained unit in accordance 
with the government’s definition13, which states “Self-containment is where 
all the rooms (including kitchen, bathroom and toilet) in a household’s 
accommodation are behind a single door which only that household can 
use.” Developments that consist of single bedroom units, such as traditional 
care or nursing homes, will not be required to provide a contribution towards 
affordable housing.

Affordable Housing on Exception Sites 
Policy H10: Exception Sites and Entry Level Housing   
  Schemes
1. Small-scale affordable housing schemes will be permitted outside 
settlements,   provided that:
i) it can be demonstrated that all the proposed dwellings meet a 
particular local need that cannot be accommodated in any other 
way;
ii)  there are satisfactory arrangements to ensure that the benefits 
of affordable housing remain in perpetuity and that the 
dwellings remain available for local people;
iii)  they have no unacceptable impact on amenity,   character and 
appearance,   environment or highways; and 
iv)  they do not form an isolated development and have access to local 
services and facilities.
2. Planning obligations will be sought before planning permission is 
issued to ensure that the above conditions are met.
3. Small-scale entry-level housing schemes will be permitted adjacent 
to existing settlements when the need for such homes is not already 
being met within the district provided that they are:
i) suitable for first time buyers or those looking to rent their first 
home;
ii) proportionate in scale to the settlement,   cumulatively no larger 
than 1 hectare in size or exceeding 5% of the size of the existing 
settlement;
iii) generating no unacceptable impact on amenity,   character and 
appearance,   environment or highways; and
iv) located outside Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty or land 
designated as Green Belt.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1,2, 4, & 6.
4.46 The Council will seek to increase the stock of affordable housing by allowing 
proposals which would not otherwise be permitted. The Council will work 
closely with Parish Councils and local communities to progress these schemes. 
The involvement of landowners is also crucial. Some landowners are prepared South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020105
to make available land at, or only slightly above, agricultural value, where 
it is understood that an exception to normal policy is being made and that 
planning permission would not be given for speculative housing development 
on that land. The Council will always support the sale of land to Registered 
Providers by agreement but, in circumstances where agreement cannot be 
reached, will consider the use of compulsory purchase powers.
4.47 The planning authority must be convinced of the need for affordable housing in 
a particular village and be satisfied that the housing provided would be available 
at a price which local people can afford. A detailed housing needs survey will be 
required with each planning application for a rural exception site to demonstrate 
the extent of the housing need arising from people with a local connection. 
Housing need is based on factors such as overcrowding, lack of or sharing of 
facilities, income, ill-health and disability. The following criteria will usually be 
used to define local connection:
•  applicant to have lived in the parish for 5 out of the last 8 years; or
• applicant’s parent or child to be currently resident in the parish, and to 
have at least 10 years’ continuous residence; or
• applicant has worked full time for 2 years in the parish, or equivalent 
in part time (this may include voluntary work), and there is evidence of 
continuing commitment to work in the parish.
4.48 Applicants must be on the housing register before they can be nominated for 
an exceptions site property. Where more applicants than vacancies exist, the 
dwellings will be allocated in accordance with our current Housing Allocations 
Policy. If there are insufficient applicants meeting these criteria, applicants 
meeting the local connection criteria for the immediately neighbouring parishes 
will be considered. In this case, applicants whose local connection is closer to the 
new properties may be given precedence over those who are more distant.
4.49 A planning obligation will normally be required to ensure that the houses 
provided meet a local need, and that satisfactory arrangements are made to 
ensure that the benefits of affordable housing remain in perpetuity. Schemes will 
normally be managed by a Registered Provider.
Policy H11: Housing Mix
1. A mix of dwelling types and sizes to meet the needs of current and 
future households will be sought on all new residential developments.
2. All affordable housing and at least 15% of market housing on sites 106
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
of 10 dwellings or more should be designed to meet the standards 
of Part M (4) Category 2: accessible and adaptable dwellings (or any 
replacement standards).
3. At least 5% of affordable housing dwellings should be designed to the 
standards of Part M (4) Category 3: wheelchair accessible dwellings.
4. All affordable housing and 1 and 2 bed market housing dwellings 
should be designed to meet the Nationally Described Space Standards.
5. The mix of housing should have regard to the Council’s latest evidence 
and Neighbourhood Development Plan evidence for the relevant area.
 
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 5 & 6.
4.50 One of the Local Plan’s objectives is to deliver a wide choice of high quality 
homes, highlighting the need to plan for a mix of housing based on current 
and future needs. Policy H11 provides that a mix of dwelling types and sizes 
to meet the needs of current and future households will be sought on all new 
residential developments. In order to meet the needs of current and future 
households, the mix of housing should have regard to the Council’s latest 
evidence, monitoring and delivery and Neighbourhood Development Plan 
evidence where applicable for the relevant area. The current evidence (the 
Oxfordshire SHMA 2014) found a shortfall in smaller units and recommended 
for most units to be 2 and 3 bedrooms. 
 
4.51 The Council will publish updates to its housing mix evidence as necessary.
4.52 While the housing mix should be informed by this evidence it will also need to 
respond to the character of the site and its setting.
4.53 New homes need to be high quality, accessible and sustainable. The 
Government has created a new system for the setting of technical standards 
for new housing. The new system comprises new additional optional Building 
Regulations (Part M) on water, access (including wheelchair access) and internal 
space. Together these are referred to as optional national technical standards. 
These new optional standards complement the existing set of Building 
Regulations, which are mandatory. Local planning authorities can choose 
whether to impose the additional optional national technical standards as their 
local standards. The additional technical standards should only be required South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020107through Local Plan policies if they address a clearly evidenced need and their 
impact on viability has been considered. Policy DES10: Carbon Reduction in 
Chapter 8 of the Plan sets energy efficiency standards for new build residential 
and non-residential developments.
4.54 The government has also introduced a nationally prescribed space standard. 
This space standard does not form part of the Building Regulations, but local 
planning authorities will be expected to apply the national space standard 
instead of any local standard previously applied.
4.55 The Council’s Housing Strategy presents evidence to support the need for 
improved accessibility and space standards in South Oxfordshire. The evidence 
shows that by 2039 over one quarter of the housing stock in South Oxfordshire 
will be occupied by people aged over 65. The vast majority of whom will want 
to continue to live in their own homes. It is amongst these older age groups, 
particularly those over 75, that a need for housing which is accessible or 
adaptable is most likely to apply.
4.56 There are 17,500 people in South Oxfordshire living with a long term health 
problem or disability of which a quarter occupy social rented housing. Those 
aged 65+ account for more than half of all people with a long term health 
problem or disability. There are significant proportions of older people living 
with disabilities across all tenures of housing, however the proportion in the 
social rented sector is disproportionately high. On average, over the four 
years 2012/13 - 2015/16, 185 adaptations have been made each year to 
properties within South Oxfordshire, and the majority of these were to housing 
association properties. 
4.57 The evidence shows there is a case in South Oxfordshire for building up a 
stock of accessible and adaptable homes, in line with Part M (4) Category 2: 
accessible and adaptable dwellings of Building Regulations, over the long term. 
The Council has considered the costs of delivering these homes through our 
viability evidence testing. This case for delivering these homes is strongest with 
regard to the affordable sector, to ensure that the affordable housing stock is 
capable of meeting their needs. The Council has control over the occupancy of 
the affordable housing stock so can ensure, as far as possible, accessible and 
adapted homes are available to those with specific needs. 
4.58 Very few wheelchair accessible properties are available in the district. In the 
5 years, 2011/12 - 2015/16, only 3 properties have been developed. There is 
evidence of some need for wheelchair accessible properties, in line with Part M 
(4) Category 3: wheelchair accessible dwellings of Building Regulations, within On average, 185 
adaptations have 
been made each 
year108
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020the affordable housing sector. The need for wheelchair accessible properties is 
relatively small in the market housing sector. 
4.59 The price of space is high. As a result developers, tend to build and buyers 
purchase and occupy smaller homes. The space available in homes in the 
affordable sector is particularly important because these homes are occupied 
more intensively than homes in the market sector. Houses are allocated on 
the minimum amount of space required and this has come under even more 
pressure since the introduction of the “under occupancy charge” which 
reduces benefit payments to working age people who are under occupying 
their homes. In comparison, in the market sector households have a greater 
tendency to buy and occupy homes according to their income and life stage 
and levels of under occupancy are often high. Overcrowding is more of 
an issue in the private rented sector, although there are not high levels of 
overcrowding in the district. It is where homes are fully occupied that it is 
important to ensure that the space available is sufficient to meet the family’s 
needs.
 
4.60 In South Oxfordshire, the majority of dwellings on the market for sale meet or 
exceed the nationally described space standards. However, there is evidence 
that a significant proportion of smaller properties in the district, such as one 
and two bedroom properties, particularly new build properties, fall below the 
space standard. This is a concern given that these properties are more likely to 
be fully occupied, particularly if they are rented. There are also some areas in 
the district, Henley-on-Thames, Didcot and Chinnor, where properties appear 
more likely to fall below the minimum space standards.
4.61 Policies to increase floor area in line with space standards are likely to result in 
higher prices for those dwellings, and this could price some households out of 
the market for new homes. 
4.62 The Council will put in place a system to collect data on the Gross Internal Area 
of new build properties, in addition to the number of bedrooms so that this 
can be monitored.The price of 
space is high.

Custom-Build and Self-Build
Policy H12: Self-Build and Custom-Build Housing
1. The Council will support proposals for self-build and custom-
build projects that are delivered in accordance with policies in the 
Development Plan.
2. On strategic allocations the Council will seek 3% of the proportion 
of the developable plots to be set aside for self-build and custom- 
build. This will be reviewed through the Authority Monitoring Report,  
subject to the need shown on the register. Self and custom-build 
properties could provide market or affordable housing.
3. Neighbourhood Development Plans should consider the local need for 
this type of development and where appropriate identify specific sites 
to allocate for self-build and custom-build housing. 
4. Where serviced plot(s) for self and custom-build have been sought as 
part of an allocation in a Neighbourhood Development Plan or strategic 
allocations within the Local Plan,   they must be made available and 
marketed for an appropriate time (to be agreed with the local planning 
authority through the granting of planning permission for the site). 
If,   following this marketing these plots have not sold,   and sufficient 
evidence is provided that there is not likely to be market interest in the 
plot(s),   the applicant will be able to develop the land for further market 
housing.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 2, 5 & 7.
4.63 Building your own home could be a more affordable way for many people to 
become home owners. The Council strongly support initiatives that provides 
opportunities for people to design and/or build their own home. The two types 
of projects can be described as follows:
• Custom-build: The eventual occupiers take on a “project management” 
role, coordinating the services of designers, architects, planners and 
construction staff. They may get actively involved in some aspects, but 
generally physical involvement is kept to a minimum.
• Self-build: The occupiers take on an active role, procuring, designing and 
building their own home. They may outsource elements of the project, 110
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020where their skills or time do not allow it. This option is generally cheaper 
than custom-build, as “sweat equity” reduces the cost of the project.
4.64 The Council hosts a register where people can indicate their interest in custom 
and self-build opportunities at https://www.southoxon.gov.uk/south-
oxfordshire-district-council/planning-and-development/local-plan-and-
planning-policies/planning-registers/self-and-custom-build-register/ 
4.65 Where there is evidence for a need for these types of plots, the Council expects 
opportunities to be identified in partnership with Parish Councils, Neighbourhood 
Planning Groups and Community Led Housing groups that could address the 
specific local need, in line with the Joint Housing Delivery Strategy and policies in the 
Development Plan. 
4.66 The Council may support provision of self-build plots as part of planning approvals to 
provide open market or affordable housing where a specific realistic and deliverable 
need is identified.
4.67 Where self-build and custom-build plots are to be provided through strategic 
allocations in the Local Plan or on major development sites, the Council will 
support their provision where they are appropriately designed and incorporated 
into the masterplan for the site and consistent with other policies within the 
Development Plan. On sites where developable plots are to be set aside for self and 
custom-build, the Council would support these plots being delivered individually or 
as collective self-build plots as part of a community led housing project.
4.68 In most cases self and custom-build proposals would be expected to be 
delivered as part of the open market part of a development site. However, in 
certain circumstances where it is in accordance with the Council’s affordable 
housing policy and there is agreement on its delivery with a Registered Housing 
Provider, it may be acceptable for it to come forward as part of the affordable 
housing contribution of the site. The Council encourages developers of such 
proposals to seek pre-application advice to determine the suitability of the 
proposals as they will be determined on a case by case basis.
4.69 The Council will monitor the number of people registered as interested in self and 
custom-build homes in South Oxfordshire and the number of permission granted 
on annual basis through the Authority Monitoring Report. The Council will support 
the delivery of this type of home in appropriate locations. The 3% plot requirement 
in Policy H12 is the percentage required to deliver the existing level of homes on the 
register solely through the proposed strategic allocations as set out in STRAT policies 
7, 9, 10i, 11, 12 and 13.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020111
Specialist Accommodation 
for Older People
Policy H13: Specialist Housing for Older People
1. Encouragement will be given to developments which include the 
delivery of specialist housing for older people in locations with good 
access to public transport and local facilities.
2. Local communities will be encouraged to identify suitable sites for 
specialist housing for older people through the Neighbourhood 
Planning process.
3. Provision should be made for specialist housing for older people 
within the strategic housing developments allocated in this plan.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 5 & 6.
4.70 Housing and health are inextricably linked, and the value of living in a suitable 
home in a sustainable location becomes even more important as people get 
older. Being able to continue living independently for as long as possible may 
require some level of support which could be provided through adaptations to 
the home or receiving social care visits at home. However, other options can 
include moving to a more suitable property – perhaps a smaller home without 
stairs - or to a home which is provided as part of a specialist housing scheme 
such as “Close Care’, Extra Care Housing or other form of retirement housing. 
Providing options for people to “downsize” to smaller or specialist housing can 
help free up family housing.
4.71 The Council’s design policies encourage the provision of housing that specifically 
caters for the needs of all people, or can be adapted for them in line with the 
“accessible and adaptable” standards in Building Regulations Part M. 
4.72  The private sector is a key player in bringing forward specialist schemes for 
older people, and full encouragement is given to such schemes on sites close to 
public transport and local shops and facilities. Developers are also encouraged 
to work with local communities to identify suitable sites within Neighbourhood 
Development Plans. Developers of specialist schemes for older people should also 112
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
work with the developers of major strategic sites to ensure that such housing is 
delivered as part of the strategic allocations. Strategic site masterplans should 
demonstrate how needs for specialist accommodation for older people have 
been incorporated in the site layout and design.
4.73  The Council will work with the County Council and Homes England to secure 
sites and obtain funding, to deliver suitable housing that enables older people 
and people with other specialist housing needs to live independently.
Gypsies, Travellers and 
Travelling Showpeople
4.74 The overall scale of need for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople 
accommodation in the district is small in comparison to wider housing needs, 
but the Council has a responsibility to address these needs. It is important 
that the Local Plan develops a fair and effective strategy to meet the needs 
of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople, particularly through the 
identification of land for pitches.
Policy H14: Provision for Gypsies, Travellers and 
Travelling Showpeople 
1. The provision of pitches for Gypsies and Travellers and plots for 
Travelling Showpeople will be delivered through:
i) safeguarding authorised sites;
ii) extending existing sites,   where possible,   to meet the needs of 
existing residents and their families;
ii) delivery within the following strategic allocations:
• 4 pitches for Gypsies and Travellers at Didcot North East 
(carried forward from Core Strategy) as shown on the policies 
map;
• 3 pitches for Gypsies and Travellers at Land adjacent to 
Culham Science Centre (STRAT9) as shown on the policies 
map;
• 3 pitches for Gypsies and Travellers at Land at Chalgrove 
Airfield (STRAT7) as shown on the policies map.
2. Additional proposals for pitches for Gypsies,   Travellers and Travelling South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020113
Showpeople not set out in Part 1 of this policy,   will be permitted 
where it has been demonstrated that the following criteria have been 
met:
i) the capacity of the site can be justified to meet needs for further 
Gypsy,   Traveller and Travelling Showpeople sites,   or extensions 
to existing sites;
ii) the site is not located within the Oxford Green Belt unless very 
special circumstances are demonstrated;
iii) the proposal will not have an unacceptable impact on the 
character and appearance of the landscape and the amenity of 
neighbouring properties,   and is sensitively designed to mitigate 
visual impacts on its surroundings;
iv) there are no adverse impacts on the significance of heritage 
assets;
v) the site has safe and satisfactory vehicular and pedestrian access 
to the surrounding principal highway network. The site will be 
large enough to enable vehicle movements,   parking and servicing 
to take place,   having regard to the number of pitches/plots on 
site;
vi) the site can be provided with safe electricity,   drinking water,  
sewage treatment and waste disposal facilities; and
vii) no significant barriers to development exist in terms of flooding,  
poor drainage,   poor ground stability or proximity to other 
hazardous land or installation where other forms of housing 
would not be suitable.
 
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 2, 4, 5 & 6.
Policy H15: Safeguarding Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling 
Showpeople Sites
1. Proposals that result in the loss of an authorised and permanent site 
for residential use by Gypsies,   Travellers and Travelling Showpeople 
will not be permitted unless it can be clearly demonstrated that:
i) the site is no longer suitable for such use and suitable alternative 
provision is made for the use on a site of equal or better quality 
with equal access to services; or
ii) that there is no need for Traveller pitches in the district.
2. Appropriate,   detailed and robust evidence will be required to 114
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
satisfy the above criteria. The Council will require the independent 
assessment of this evidence.
3. Planning conditions or legal obligations may be necessary to ensure 
that any replacement sites are provided. Any replacement site should 
be available before the original site is lost.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 2, 4, 5 & 6.
 
4.75 Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople are defined as persons that are 
leading or have led a nomadic life. Travelling Showpeople differ from other 
Gypsies and Travellers as their employment and travel centres upon holding fairs, 
circuses or shows across the country. Therefore, different terminology is used 
when referring to their residential needs. Gypsy and Traveller households tend 
to reside on a residential “pitch” within a Traveller “site” whereas Travelling 
Showpeople tend to reside on mixed-use “plots” within a Travelling Showperson’s 
“yard”.
4.76 Local planning authorities are required to set pitch and plot targets for Travellers 
which address their accommodation needs. The Council identify these needs 
by undertaking a Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showperson Accommodation 
Assessment (GTAA), which identifies how many additional permanent Traveller 
pitches will have to be delivered during the plan period. The GTAA was updated 
to reflect changes to national guidance set out in Planning Policy for Traveller 
Sites (2015) (PPTS). The most significant of these changes was to the planning 
definition of a ‘Gypsy’ or ‘Traveller’. Gypsies and Travellers who have stopped 
travelling permanently due to ill health or old age have now been removed from 
this definition. The changes also make it much more difficult for Gypsies and 
Travellers to get planning permission for pitches located in the Green Belt or open 
countryside.
4.77 The GTAA (2017), prepared jointly with Cherwell District Council, Oxford City 
Council and Vale of White Horse District Council, identified a need for 10 
additional permanent Gypsy and Traveller pitches to be delivered to 2033. For 
the Travelling Showperson community, the assessment identified no need for 
any additional plots. The need identified in the most recent GTAA is lower than 
the need identified in the GTAA update in 2014. This is because the Council is 
only required to identity pitches and plots for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople who meet the planning definition set out in PPTS (2015).  
4.78 The 10 pitch requirement includes provision for Traveller families where it was 
unknown whether they met the planning definition set out in PPTS (2015). South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020115
The accommodation needs of families where it was known that they no longer 
meet the definition are taken into account with other ‘caravan dwellers’. 
To guide speculative applications appropriately, Policy H14 includes criteria 
against which applications for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople 
accommodation can be assessed.
 
4.79 Work was undertaken in 2013/14 to identify appropriate sites for permanent 
Traveller pitches. The Delivery of Pitches report (2015) recommended 
safeguarding all existing permanent Traveller sites within the district and 
intensifying and/or extending these, where appropriate. The study also identified 
new sites with the potential of being suitable for permanent Traveller sites. This 
included the greenfield neighbourhood development at Didcot, now known as 
Didcot North East, which was considered suitable for 15 permanent Traveller 
pitches. Delivering pitches on this site was also identified as a priority in the 
Core Strategy (Policy CSH5). Other sites recommended by the study as sites 
with potential and future potential could not be taken forward for a variety of 
reasons including, the sites being needed for infrastructure improvements, the 
sites being identified for a different use in a Neighbourhood Development Plan, 
the sites being located in the Green Belt or the sites identified as potential waste 
management sites.
4.80 Taking into account the recommendations made by the Delivery of Pitches 
report (2015) previous priorities set out in the Core Strategy and our strategy for 
this Local Plan, we have identified three sites that could deliver the 10 pitches 
required. The Council have taken forward the previous commitment from the 
Core Strategy to provide pitches at Didcot North East and are allocating four 
pitches to this site. The remaining six pitches will be delivered at our strategic 
sites at Chalgrove and Culham. Allocating pitches at strategic sites allows us to 
consider the needs of Travellers at the outset of the design process and properly 
integrate the pitches into the design of the development.
4.81 The Council will continue to monitor the need for and supply of Traveller pitches 
and plots within the district.
Infill Development 
 
Policy H16: Backland and Infill Development and 
Redevelopment
1. Within Smaller Villages and Other Villages,   development should be 
limited to infill and the redevelopment of previously developed land Work was 
undertaken 
in 2013/14 
to identify 
appropriate sites 
for permanent 
Traveller pitches116
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
or buildings. 
2. Infill development is defined as the filling of a small gap in an 
otherwise continuous built-up frontage or on other sites within 
settlements where the site is closely surrounded by buildings. The 
scale of infill should be appropriate to its location.
3. Where a proposal encompasses residential development of land 
behind an existing frontage or placing of further dwelling/s behind 
existing dwelling/s within the existing site,   the proposals should 
demonstrate that:
  i)  the privacy of existing and future residents will be protected;
  ii)  means of access can be appropriately secured; and
  iii)  development would not extend the built limits of the settlement.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 2, 4, 5 & 6.
4.82 The development of large back gardens or land behind an existing residential 
frontage may be acceptable in principle if it meets the criteria in the above 
policy. However, such development will not normally be permitted if it creates 
problems of privacy and access.
Subdivision of Dwellings and 
Multiple Occupation
Policy H17: Sub-division and Conversion to Multiple 
Occupation
1. The sub-division of dwellings and conversions to multiple occupation 
will be permitted provided that the development:
i) would not harm the amenity of the occupants of nearby 
properties; and
ii) is appropriate in terms of the size of the property and the 
proposed internal layout,   access,   private amenity space and car 
parking provision.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 2, 4, 5 & 6.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020117
4.83 The sub-division of larger properties into flats can add to the stock of smaller 
and less expensive dwellings, more of which will be required over the coming 
decade to accommodate the growth in smaller households. Houses in multiple 
occupation have a number of residents living in them as separate households 
and they can provide a useful and relatively affordable form of accommodation 
for single people. However, subdivision and conversion to multiple occupation 
will not be permitted if it would result in access problems, over development, 
lack of garden space, lack of car parking space and a general alteration to the 
character of the property and the residential character of the area, either on 
its own or cumulatively. The introduction of large areas of hard surfaces for 
car parking in gardens will be resisted where it would be detrimental to the 
character of the area.
Replacement Dwellings
Policy H18: Replacement Dwellings
1. Proposals for the replacement of an existing dwelling located outside 
the built-up areas of settlements will be permitted provided that:
i) the residential use of the existing dwelling has not been 
abandoned;
ii) the existing dwelling is not subject to a temporary or time 
limited planning permission;
iv) within the Green Belt,   the proposed replacement dwelling is not 
materially larger than the dwelling it replaces*; and
v) the proposal can demonstrate that satisfactory vehicular access 
and parking arrangements and adequate amenity areas are 
retained for the replacement dwelling.
 * External garages and outbuildings will not be included in this calculation.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 & 7.
4.84 In the Green Belt, replacement dwellings should not be materially larger than 
the dwellings they replace. The Council will, therefore, normally only grant 
planning permission for the replacement of a dwelling within the Green Belt 
which is not materially greater in volume than the dwelling it replaces, taking 
into account any permitted development rights which remain unused. Not 
materially greater in volume means that, in addition to any unused permitted 118
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
development rights, an increase of up to, but no more than, 10% in volume 
may be acceptable provided that the overall impact would not be any greater 
than the existing dwelling on the character and appearance of the site and the 
surrounding area. Where the existing dwelling has garage accommodation 
which is to be demolished, applications for the replacement dwelling should 
also include replacement garage accommodation or the volume of the 
replacement dwelling should be reduced commensurately.
4.85 Where planning permission is granted for a replacement dwelling with a 
volume which is inclusive of permitted development rights, the Council will 
impose a condition removing permitted development rights for extensions/
additions to the new house. Where applications are submitted to extend 
replacement dwellings, the Council will take into account the size of the 
dwelling it replaced. In all cases, the Council will seek to ensure that the new 
dwelling does not have a greater impact on the character of the site and its 
surroundings than the existing dwelling due to its scale, size, form or materials 
used. In the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Council will give great 
weight to conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the area, wildlife 
and cultural heritage.
Rural Workers’ Dwellings
Policy H19: Rural Workers’ Dwellings
1. The provision of a rural worker dwelling in the open countryside will 
be permitted provided that:
i) it is essential,   and can be demonstrated there is an existing 
need for one or more permanent full time workers to be readily 
available at all times for the rural enterprise to operate viably;
ii) the functional need cannot be met by other suitable available 
existing dwellings in the locality of the rural enterprise;
iii) the rural enterprise is economically sustainable,   has been 
established for at least 3 years and is likely to remain financially 
viable for the foreseeable future;
iv) the size and scale of the dwelling is proportional with the needs 
of the rural enterprise; and
v) it respects the landscape,   rural character,   and its rural locality.
2. If a rural worker dwelling is essential to support a new rural 
enterprise it should be provided temporarily by a caravan,   a wooden South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020119
structure which can easily be dismantled,   or other temporary 
accommodation for the first three years.
3. Planning permission will be subject to an appropriate occupancy 
condition,   restricting its occupation to a person who is directly 
employed on a permanent full time basis and their family.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 2, 3 & 7.
4.86 The planning system should seek to support a prosperous rural economy. 
The Council will support economic growth in rural areas to create jobs and 
prosperity by taking a positive approach to sustainable new development 
and balancing sustainable growth with the protection of the countryside. 
The Council recognises that the demands of rural businesses can sometimes 
necessitate the need for one or more employees to live either at, or close 
to, their place of work. This demand can arise from a range of rural based 
enterprises, such as farming, forestry, and commercial equine-related 
businesses. The Council will therefore support the need for rural workers’ 
dwellings in the open countryside where there is a demonstrable need in 
order to sustain the effective operation of a viable rural business. A financial 
appraisal will need to be provided with any proposal.
4.87 The proposal will need to demonstrate that there is no suitable available 
existing accommodation in the vicinity of the rural business (such as the nearest 
settlement) or buildings suitable for re-use and conversion to residential use, 
either on the site of the rural enterprise, or in its locality. Proposals for new 
120
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
rural enterprises requiring a rural worker dwelling will need to demonstrate 
how the business will be viable and sustainable for the longer term.
4.88 If the proposal complies with this policy, permission will be given for temporary 
accommodation for the first three years before an application for a permanent 
dwelling will be considered. The Council may also seek a legal agreement to 
tie the building to the land to discourage subsequent fragmentation of the 
agricultural unit by separate use of the building.
Extensions to Dwellings
Policy H20: Extensions to Dwellings
1. Extensions to dwellings or the erection and extension of ancillary 
buildings within the curtilage of a dwelling,   will be permitted 
provided that:
i) within the Green Belt the extension or the alteration of a 
building does not result in disproportionate additions over and 
above the size of the original* building;
ii) adequate and satisfactory parking is provided. Development 
should have regard to the Oxfordshire County Council parking 
standards,   unless specific evidence is provided to justify 
otherwise; and
iii) sufficient amenity areas are provided for the extended dwelling. 
Development should have regard to the advice within the South 
Oxfordshire Design Guide. 
*’Original’ means the volume as existing on July 1st 1948, or if 
constructed after that date, as originally built. Garages and outbuildings 
will not be included in this calculation.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 & 7.
4.89 Planning permission is not always required for house extensions but where it 
is needed, the above policy will apply. Householders contemplating alterations 
or extensions to their home should check with us to see whether planning 
permission is required and have regard to the Design Guide.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020121
Accommodation in Town 
Centres 
Policy H21: Loss of Existing Residential Accommodation 
in Town Centres
1. The loss of existing residential accommodation in the town centres 
will not be permitted other than in accordance with the relevant 
policies of this Plan,   except in cases of upper floor accommodation 
where an independent access does not exist and cannot be provided,  
or in cases where there are insurmountable environmental factors 
which militate against continued residential use. The loss of private 
gardens,   which could affect the residential amenity of the occupants 
of existing dwellings will also be resisted.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 & 7.
4.90 It is particularly important to retain residential accommodation in the town 
centres to maintain a balance between uses and to allow easy access 
to services. The Council will allow a change of use in the exceptional 
circumstances described in the policy. With regard to environmental factors, 
however, there will be few locations in the four South Oxfordshire towns 
where noise, fumes or other forms of nuisance will be such as to render 
premises unsuitable for living accommodation. The local planning authority will 
be guided in this matter by advice from its environmental health department.
4.91 The amenity afforded by a private garden is often an important factor in 
keeping town centre flats and houses in residential use. The Council will, 
therefore, resist development that would destroy such gardens.122

ambitionsEMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMY
Introduction
5.1 Oxfordshire is one of the strongest economies in the UK, and is home to 
one of the most important clusters of research-based, high-value businesses 
in Europe, including scientific research and development, higher education, 
health related industries, car manufacture and motorsports, creative and digital 
sector businesses and visitor economy. Oxfordshire is uniquely placed with 
sectors poised for growth including medicine and life sciences (bio-technology 
for example), advanced engineering (cryogenics, space, advanced materials), 
information technology, and low carbon environmental technologies14. 
However economic growth is hindered by productivity per person being 
below the average for the South East of England, a heavily constrained energy 
network, higher median house prices and, while full fibre roll out is double the 
UK average at 8%, this is well behind our international competitors.
5.2 South Oxfordshire lies within the economically buoyant Thames Valley area 
between Oxford and Reading. The western part of the district lies within 
Science Vale, the location of a particularly high density of science and high- 
technology activities centred around Harwell Campus15, Culham Science Centre 
and Milton Park (one of Europe’s largest business parks) and containing both 
the Science Vale Oxford and Didcot Growth Accelerator Enterprise Zones.
5.3 The Oxfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership (OxLEP) published a Strategic 
Economic Plan (SEP) in 2016 setting out an ambition for accelerated economic 
growth for Oxfordshire. The Plan seeks to meet the needs of our science and 
knowledge-rich economy, placing Oxfordshire at the forefront of the UK’s 
global growth ambitions. In 2019, OxLEP also published its Local Industrial 
Strategy (LIS), which outlines how Oxfordshire will support the achievement 
of the National Industrial Strategy. The LIS builds on the SEP, providing a 
framework to guide public and private sector investment, which itself will 
help Oxfordshire to secure its position as a top global innovation network and 
increase productivity all business sectors.
5.4 Whilst the LIS will benefit approximately 20% of South Oxfordshire businesses, 
the Council’s Business and Innovation Strategy (BIS) 2017 to 2020 outlines its 
support for all businesses in the district: from the home-based sole traders to the 
rapidly growing small and medium businesses that are integral to the science 
and high-technology supply chain. The BIS highlights the challenges businesses 5
123South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020124
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020have in finding quality office space of the right size, in the right location, and at 
the right price. The Local Plan can help address this challenge by implementing 
policies to encourage the safeguarding and refurbishment of existing 
employment land and the creation of new sites that will allow our innovative 
businesses to increase productivity and grow.
5.5 South Oxfordshire’s four towns are the main employment centres, yet there is 
also employment provided by a large number of small firms and some major 
international research institutions elsewhere within the district. The largest 
employment centre outside the towns is Culham Science Centre, which 
specialises in fusion research and hosts a number of high-tech research and 
development activities in energy, materials and robotics, as well as commercial 
technology organisations. The business area around Monument Business Park 
at Chalgrove provides an important range of businesses and premises. There 
is also an important cluster of environmental science companies and research 
institutions at Crowmarsh Gifford and Wallingford.
5.6 South Oxfordshire has a higher than average number of economically active 
people at 83.5% compared with a national average of 75.8% (Jan to Dec 
2019). The number of economically active people increased from 73,400 (in 
2014) to 77,700 (in 2019). Unemployment fell from 2.9% to 2.1% over the 
same period16. 
5.7 The Local Plan will continue to encourage and support the local economy 
and develop a balance between jobs and housing. The majority of workers 
employed in South Oxfordshire are employed in the service industries, a third 
of which are within financial and other business services, which is above the 
national average. The second largest sector is Public Administration, Education 
and Health. South Oxfordshire has a slightly higher than average number of 
micro-businesses that employ up to 9 people. South Oxfordshire has a higher 
than average number of people employed at Manager, Director or Senior 
Official level. South Oxfordshire’s residents are highly-qualified, again above 
the national average.
5.8 Employers take a very positive view of South Oxfordshire as a place to do 
business. Key strengths highlighted by employers include its central geographic 
location bringing them in close proximity to customers, suppliers and other 
businesses alongside good transport links and the fact that it is a thriving and 
prosperous area17. For many small and medium enterprises the quality of life 
and work/life balance represents the key reason for locating and operating 
within the district18.16 ONS annual population survey

working within the district. This means that people living within the district 
were earning higher incomes by commuting to work outside of the district, 
mostly in the surrounding areas of ‘Science Vale’ in the Vale of White Horse, 
Reading and Oxford, and also by commuting to London. This implies that 
the area suffers from a leakage of highly skilled residents to employment 
elsewhere.
Economic Forecasts
5.10 The 2014 SHMA forecasts anticipated economic growth across Oxfordshire 
and the district between 2011 and 2031. The SHMA forecasts a total increase 
in employment of around 88,000 people for Oxfordshire with an increase of 
11,455 jobs in South Oxfordshire from 2011 to 2031. The ‘South Oxfordshire 
Employment Land Review Addendum’ (SOELRA) published in August 2017 
examines the forecasts of the 2014 SHMA. Based on the SHMA, the SOELRA 
projects an increase of 12,403 jobs from 2011 to 2033 with an increase of 
between 6,227 and 6,734 jobs in the office, manufacturing and distribution 
sectors.
5.11 To plan for the economic growth forecast in the 2014 SHMA, the SOELRA 
forecasts (based on its labour supply forecasting scenario) that 35.9 hectares 
of additional employment land is required in the district over the period 
2011 to 2033. As this employment forecast ends at 2033, to account for the  
further two years in the plan period beyond the date of the evidence base, an 
additional requirement of 3.2 hectares is required (based on a pro-rata for the 
previous plan period). This results in a minimum employment requirement of  
39.1 hectares of employment land in the district over the period 2011 to 2035.
5.12 The 2015 South Oxfordshire Employment Land Review (ELR) reports that, 
within South Oxfordshire employment land comprised approximately:
• 40.7 hectares (234,100sqm) of gross office floorspace and
• 265.1 hectares of gross industrial land
• A third of this industrial land is in light or general industrial use, with the 
majority in warehousing and distribution use.
5.13 The 2015 ELR undertook a review of the quality and characteristics of 
employment land in the district, identifying where existing employment areas 
have capacity for expansion. It went on to make recommendations for the 
potential locations and approximate amounts of additional office, research and 
development space:
125126
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020• Culham Science Centre: 3.3 hectares (19,000sqm)
• Central Didcot: 2.6 hectares (15,000sqm)
• Land at or near Monument Business Park - Chalgrove: 0.7 hectares 
(4,000sqm)
• With a remainder of 0.3 hectares (2,000sqm) met in the town centres 
of Henley-on-Thames, Wallingford (including Crowmarsh Gifford) and 
Thame.
5.14 The 2015 ELR also made recommendations for the potential locations and 
approximate amounts of additional industrial land:
• Crowmarsh Gifford: 2.5 hectares
• Culham Science Centre: Approximately 1.3 hectares
• Hithercroft Industrial Estate - Wallingford: 1.9 hectares
• London Road Industrial Estate - Wheatley: 0.4 hectares
• Land at or near Monument Business Park - Chalgrove: 2.5 hectares
• Southmead Industrial Estate - Didcot: 2.9 hectares
• Thame: 1.6 hectares
• With a remainder of 6.3 hectares provided at new sites at the four main towns.
Strategy
5.15 The Council aims to ensure that all residents have the skills and infrastructure 
needed to gain meaningful employment locally, and to be highly productive 
in those jobs. The Local Plan continues to support the increased productivity 
and growth of all sectors through supporting business formation, growth and 
relocation as well as supporting the delivery of infrastructure necessary for this 
to occur. This inclusive economic view will give all people the opportunity to 
work at, or nearer their home and reduce long distance out-commuting. The 
Local Plan aims to support the provision of jobs for the increased population 
of the district and flexible business space that fulfils demand. The Council will 
encourage key economic sectors that can add value to the local economy, 
along with supporting existing businesses and education providers.
5.16  The Council aims to support inclusive and sustainable development by 
planning new housing close to employment development and by working 
with partners to improve skills and productivity amongst residents. Flexibility is 
key to respond to changing economic circumstances by having enough land 
available that is capable of being developed and well served by digital, utility 
and transport infrastructure. The Council also needs to make sure that there 
are a variety of sites for large and small businesses, for innovation and for skills 
development, all of which links to the knowledge-based economy and the 
sharing of local innovation and technology that can improve productivity. The Local Plan 
aims to support 
the provision 
of jobs for 
the increased 
population of 
the district and 
flexible business 
space that fulfils 
demandSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 20201275.17 The Council’s strategy makes a strong link between the housing growth in 
Didcot and the business growth needs of ‘Science Vale’, including at Harwell 
Campus and Milton Park outside the district (within Vale of White Horse 
District). The Council has worked with Vale of White Horse District Council to 
plan for enough jobs to cater for Didcot’s increased population. Core Policy 
6 of the adopted Vale of White Horse Local Plan 2031 identifies 28 hectares 
of employment land at Milton Park within the Vale of White Horse District, of 
which 6.5 hectares is to meet the cross-boundary employment land needs of 
Didcot within South Oxfordshire.
5.18 The Local Plan’s locations for employment are as follows:
• Within Science Vale:
• Culham Science Centre and the adjacent strategic site;
• Didcot (with some at Milton Park in the Vale of White Horse); and
• The strategic site in Berinsfield.
• At sustainable locations:
• The strategic sites in Chalgrove and Grenoble Road;
• The towns of Henley-on-Thames, Thame and Wallingford with sites to 
be identified in Neighbourhood Development Plans; and
• At Crowmarsh Gifford with sites to be identified in the 
Neighbourhood Development Plan. 
5.19 The Local Plan supports developments at the Culham Science Centre and land to 
the west of the Science Centre which focuses growth within Science Vale, close 
to Didcot and with rail links to Oxford. The Science Centre site and the adjacent 
land will be planned comprehensively and will incorporate an additional 7.3 
hectares of employment land. There will be opportunities for the replacement of 
temporary buildings at the Science Centre and an intensification of existing uses. 
There may be the need for redevelopment of some buildings for industries that 
tend to provide a lower density of employment. The Local Plan is planning for 
the redevelopment of the Culham No.1 site between the Culham Science Centre 
and the railway station to make the most of this sustainable location. The Plan 
requires the 10 hectares of existing employment land on this site to be retained 
within the wider area and the Council will support the relocation of the existing 
business if required.
5.20 The Council is supporting significant housing development at Chalgrove 
Airfield, Berinsfield and Grenoble Road. To enable the creation of sustainable 
communities and to provide new residents with the chance to work locally, 
the Local Plan proposes allocations for additional employment land at these 
locations to complement the strategic allocations. In addition, the Local Plan 
supports the provision of additional employment land at the four towns as 128
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
these are sustainable locations where additional housing delivery will take 
place over the plan period.

Types of Employment Premises 
5.21 In order to meet the diverse need for employment across South Oxfordshire the 
policy below requires a range of premises within any proposals for employment 
development.
Policy EMP2: Range, Size and Mix of Employment 
Premises
1. Proposals for em ployment use will provide a range of sizes and types of 
premises,   including flexible business space to meet current and future 
requirements. The Council will support proposals for premises suitable 
for small and medium sized businesses,   including start-up/ incubator 
businesses (up to 150sqm) and grow-on space (up to 500sqm). 
Proposals for em ployment uses will be considered against this criteria 
and the overall em ployment distribution strategy at EMP1.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3 & 6.
5.22 South Oxfordshire District Council, in partnership with the Vale of White 
Horse District Council, commissioned consultants Lichfields to prepare a Small 
to Medium Sized Enterprises (SME) Business and Innovation Strategy (2017).
The strategy highlights the importance of SMEs in South Oxfordshire and the 
difficulties these firms are experiencing in finding suitable premises.
5.23 To promote a balanced local economy, the Plan needs to ensure that a range 
of size and types of premises is available. The Council will seek to widen 
the variety of premises to include more modern and flexible business space. 
Enough space is needed for small and medium sized businesses, including 
start-up/incubator businesses (up to 150sqm) and grow-on space (up to 
500sqm), and opportunities to provide this will be sought. Whether units are 
suitable for start-up/incubator businesses will depend partly on management 
arrangements and lease terms that are beyond our control; however the 
Council will do all it can to assist in this regard.130
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Retention of Employment Sites
Policy EMP3: Retention of Employment Land
1. Existing em ployment land will be retained in order to promote and 
grow a balanced,   sustainable economy and local services. Proposals 
for the redevelopment or change of use of em ployment land to non-
employment uses will only be permitted if:
i) the applicants can demonstrate that any em ployment use is no 
longer viable; or
ii) it is evidenced that there is no market interest in the site 
following one year of active and effective marketing; or
iii) the development would bring about significant im provements 
to the living conditions of nearby residents,   or to the 
environment. In assessing this,   the Council will consider whether 
there is a realistic prospect of mitigating the detrimental effects 
of continuing em ployment use.
2. In addition to the criteria above,   where there is no reasonable prospect 
of land or premises being used for continued em ployment use,   a mixed 
use enabling development which incorporates employment space 
should first be considered.
3. Schemes that im prove the stock of existing em ployment land,  
employment premises,   commercial buildings and the environment of 
existing em ployment areas will be supported.
4. Through the monitoring of em ployment land gains and losses,   the 
Council will record,   and publish in the Authorities Monitoring Report,  
how much land the Council continues to need to meet the projected 
employment land requirements in the district. The Council will use this 
information to help determine planning applications.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3 & 6.
5.24 To support sustainable economic growth, meet the development needs of 
businesses and the anticipated needs over the plan period and to ensure that 
sufficient land of the right type is available, the Council will seek to ensure that 
employment land is not lost during economic fluctuations. The policy seeks to 
ensure that employment land is only released for other uses where there is no 
reasonable prospect of a site being used for that purpose. South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020131
5.25 It is important that local employment sites are retained to maintain a 
reasonable balance of employment and housing uses within settlements. 
This affords the residents of the villages, towns and surrounding areas the 
opportunity to find work locally. This need is particularly strong as a number of 
employment sites and premises have been redeveloped for housing in recent 
years. Local employment plays an important role in supporting local services 
and facilities and supporting sustainable communities.
5.26 The district is an area of economic growth and demand for premises is usually 
high. However, there may be instances where the continued use of a site for 
employment is not economically viable. In such circumstances, and before 
any planning permission for alternative, non-employment uses is granted, the 
Council will require evidence that the site has been marketed reasonably at 
a realistic price for at least one year. The Council is likely to take advice from 
property consultants about the evidence submitted and prevailing market 
conditions. The Council has a guidance note that demonstrates the sorts of 
marketing that will be necessary to meet the above criterion for market interest 
evidence. In the event that any employment use is demonstrably not viable in 
economic terms, the Council requires that a range or mix of alternative uses is 
explored and the policies in this Plan on other uses will apply.
The Four Towns
Policy EMP4: Employment Land in Didcot
1. In addition to em ployment opportunities generated through the 
Didcot Garden Town Delivery Plan and the strategic allocations in this 
Plan,   2.92 hectares of em ployment land will be delivered at Didcot at 
the following sites located within Southmead Industrial Estate:
• Site EMP4i: Southmead Industrial Estate East (2.66 hectares)
• Site EMP4ii: Southmead Industrial Estate West (0.26 hectares)
2. A small part of site EMP4i is located within an area of flood 
risk. Employment uses are classed as ‘less vulnerable’,   however 
comprehensive development of the site should be appropriate to the 
flood risk level.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3 & 6.132

Policy EMP5: New Employment Land at Henley-on-
Thames
1. In addition to allocations in the made Joint Henley and Harpsden 
Neighbourhood Development Plan,   at least a further 1 hectare of 
employment land will be delivered at Henley-on-Thames. This will be 
delivered through a review of the Neighbourhood Development Plan.
2. The review of the Neighbourhood Development Plan must be 
submitted to the Council within 12 months of adoption of this Local 
Plan. If the Neighbourhood Development Plan has not adequately 
progressed with allocating sites* to meet these requirements within 
12 months of the adoption of this Local Plan,   planning applications for 
employment will be supported provided that proposals com ply with 
the overall em ployment distribution strategy as set out in Policy EMP1 
and the overall plan distribution strategy as set out in STRAT1.
 *When the Plan has reached submission stage and has allocated sufficient 
employment sites.

Policy EMP6: New Employment Land at Thame
1. In addition to allocations in the made Thame Neighbourhood 
Development Plan,   at least a further 3.5 hectares of em ployment land 
will be delivered at Thame. This will be delivered through a review of 
the Neighbourhood Development Plan.
2. The review of the Neighbourhood Development Plan must be 
submitted to the Council within 12 months of adoption of this Local 
Plan. If a Neighbourhood Development Plan has not adequately 
progressed with allocating sites* to meet these requirements within

Policy EMP7: New Employment Land at Wallingford
1. Em ployment land will be delivered at Wallingford at the following sites 
located within Hithercroft Industrial Estate:
• Site EMP7i: land at Hithercroft Road and Lupton Road (0.84 hectares)
• Site EMP7ii: land at the junction of Whitley Road and Lester Way 
(0.25 hectares)
2. At least a further 3.10 hectares of em ployment land will be delivered 
at Wallingford through the Neighbourhood Development Plan. The 
Neighbourhood Development Plan must be submitted to the Council 
within 12 months of adoption of this Local Plan. If the Neighbourhood 
Development Plan is not adequately progressed with allocating sites* 
to meet these requirements within 12 months of adoption of this 
Local Plan,   planning applications for em ployment will be supported 
providing that proposals com ply with the overall em ployment 
distribution strategy as set out in Policy EMP1 and the overall plan 
distribution strategy as set out in STRAT1.
 *When the Plan has reached submission stage and has allocated sufficient 
employment sites
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3 & 6.
5.27 High-tech and science related businesses are important to the district and this 
creates indirect demand for employment floorspace linked to Science Vale. 
This includes supply chain firms that seek to be close to but do not have to be 
within Science Vale. Wallingford/ Crowmarsh Gifford is a key location for this 
type of demand with around a third of the overall South Oxfordshire industrial 
demand located in this area.134
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Employment Sites in the Villages
Policy EMP8: New Employment Land at Crowmarsh 
Gifford
1. At least 0.28 hectares of em ployment land will be delivered at 
Crowmarsh Gifford. This will be delivered through the Neighbourhood 
Development Plan.
2. If the Neighbourhood Development Plan is not adequately progressed 
with allocating sites* to meet these requirements within 12 months 
of adoption of this Local Plan,   planning applications for em ployment 
will be supported provided that proposals com ply with the overall 
employment distribution strategy as set out in Policy EMP1 and the 
policies within the Development Plan.
 *The Plan has reached submission stage and has allocated sufficient 
employment sites.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3 & 6.
Policy EMP9: New Employment Land at Chalgrove
1. In addition to the strategic allocations at Chalgrove Airfield,   2.25 
hectares of em ployment land will be delivered at Chalgrove at the 
following site:
• Site EMP9i: Land at Monument Business Park (2.25 hectares)
2. The site has outline planning permission for em ployment use,   part of 
which,   approximately 0.44 hectares,   has already been built out since 
2011. Policy EMP9 safeguards this site for future em ployment growth.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3 & 6South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020135
Development in Rural Areas
Policy EMP10: Development in Rural Areas
1. Proposals for sustainable economic growth in rural areas will be 
supported. The Council will:
i) support the sustainable growth and expansion of all types of 
business and enterprise in rural areas through conversion of 
existing buildings;
ii) promote the sustainable development and diversification of 
agricultural and other land-based rural businesses;
iii) support sustainable rural tourism and leisure developments that 
benefit businesses,   communities and visitors in rural areas and 
which respect the character of the countryside. This will include 
supporting the provision and expansion of tourist and visitor 
facilities in appropriate locations where identified needs are not 
met by existing facilities in rural service centres; and
iv) promote the retention and development of local services and 
community facilities in villages,   such as local shops,   meeting 
places,   sports venues,   cultural buildings,   public houses and 
places of worship.
This policy contributes towards objectives 1, 3, 4, 6 & 7.
5.28 The re-use and adaptation of existing rural buildings has an important 
role in meeting the needs of the rural areas for commercial and industrial 
development, as well as for tourism, sport and recreation. The re-use of rural 
buildings can reduce demands for new building in the countryside, avoid 
leaving an existing building vacant, boost the economy and provide jobs. In 
recent years, the re-use of rural buildings has provided a substantial stock 
of buildings for employment use. This policy applies to buildings which are 
outside the built-up areas of the towns and villages of the district.
5.29 Buildings to be re-used should be permanent and substantial, and not require 
reconstruction. To meet this requirement, buildings should normally be 
enclosed on all sides and the whole of the structure covered by a roof and it 
should be in a sound structural condition. The Council may request applicants 136
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020provide a structural survey to demonstrate that this requirement can be met.
5.30 The Local Plan generally supports the re-use of rural buildings for employment 
use. Such buildings are often particularly suitable as they often need little 
adaptation. New development should be located where the need to travel 
by car can be reduced and where cycling and walking and the use of public 
transport can be maximised. Any proposals for the enclosure of adjoining 
land as part of the re-use of the building will be an important consideration 
especially in terms of potential impact on the landscape.
5.31 To prevent the proliferation of buildings in the countryside, planning 
permission for the conversion of farm buildings may be subject to conditions 
to prevent their replacement by new buildings under permitted development 
rights. Similarly, the Council is unlikely to grant planning permission for 
the conversion of buildings erected as the result of a temporary permission 
or under permitted development rights where they have clearly not been 
genuinely needed or used for agriculture.
 
Tourism and Visitors
5.32 Tourists and visitors make an important contribution to the economy and 
employment in Oxfordshire. In 2014 £1.56 billion was spent by visitors to 
Oxfordshire with a further £362.5 million of business turnover generated 
through indirect and induced spending (multiplier spend). This supported 
23,197 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs and 32,089 actual jobs and accounted 
for 5.7% of all employee jobs across the County19. 
5.33 Tourism expenditure provides economic benefits to the rural areas, villages 
and towns of the district and assists with the viability of facilities and services 
that can also benefit residents. Tourists are attracted to South Oxfordshire by 
a wide range of features, including the district’s attractive countryside, the 
River Thames, the pretty villages and the historic market towns of Henley-on-
Thames, Thame and Wallingford.

Tourist Attractions and Facilities
Policy EMP11: Tourism
1. The Council encourages new development to advance the visitor 
economy for leisure and business purposes. Proposals for such 
purposes will be supported as follows:
i) within the built-up areas of the towns - larger scale 
developments including conference facilities,   museums,   heritage 
centres,   hotels,   guest houses and associated facilities for visitors;
ii) within the built-up areas of the larger and smaller villages – 
smaller and proportionately scaled developments that are 
in keeping with the character of the settlement,   including 
museums,   heritage centres,   hotels,   guest houses,   self-catering 
accommodation and associated facilities for visitors; and
iii) at service areas on the main transport corridors - hotel 
accommodation.
2. Outside the above locations,   small-scale development to support 
the visitor economy,   including farm diversification and equine 
development,   will be supported provided that proposals are in 
keeping with the scale and character of the locality and would not 
adversely affect heritage assets or their setting. Larger developments 
will only be supported in exceptional circumstances,   for exam ple to 
sensitively re-use a historic building,   or to proportionally support or 
enhance enjoyment of a significant and established visitor attraction 
where this cannot reasonably be achieved from a town or village 
location.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 3 & 6.
5.34 The Council will generally be sympathetic to proposals to improve existing 
tourist attractions and to the creation of new attractions which have regard to 
the character, landscape and heritage of the area. Examples include opening 
historic houses or gardens to the public, farm visits, museums, historic trails, 
interpretation plaques and interpretation centres.
5.35 Facilities which assist tourists by providing information or services, such as 
picnic areas, toilets, car parks and information points, can contribute to the 
enjoyment of a visit and will normally be permitted. The policy will ensure 
that such development is in keeping with the locality, both in terms of scale 138
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020and design of any new building, and the level of activity and type of use. 
The Council will support schemes to improve existing signing for tourist 
attractions and facilities, where appropriate, if well designed and in keeping 
with the surrounding area. Applicants should refer to the “Tourism Signing in 
Oxfordshire” Application Pack produced by Oxfordshire County Council for 
guidance. Anyone wishing to erect a sign should seek advice from the Council 
to see whether consent is required under the Advertisement Regulations and 
have regard to the relevant policies of this Plan.
Serviced Accommodation, Public Houses and Restaurants 
5.36 A joint Hotel Needs Assessment20 has been prepared with Vale of White 
Horse District Council. The assessment confirms the need for a significant 
increase in hotel supply in the Science Vale area, and further hotels in Thame, 
Henley-on-Thames and Wallingford. The Council will normally grant planning 
permission for new hotels, including conference facilities and other serviced 
accommodation, in the larger settlements outside the Green Belt. Extensions 
to existing premises will normally be permitted on sites outside the Green Belt. 
The conversion of suitable buildings to provide visitor accommodation will 
normally be permitted throughout the district, particularly as this can provide a 
good way of retaining historically important buildings in a viable use.
5.37  Proposals for additional visitor accommodation should protect the amenities 
of the occupants of neighbouring properties and should not cause traffic 
congestion or disturbance. Proposals must be of high quality design in 
accordance with the Design Guide and respect their surrounding environment. 
It is important that adequate off-street car parking is provided and that it is 
designed and landscaped to blend with its surroundings.
5.38 The use of existing homes to provide Bed and Breakfast is generally supported 
because it makes a valuable contribution to the local economy and provides 
for good value, short-stay visits. In many cases, the provision of some Bed and 
Breakfast accommodation may not require planning permission, however, the 
advice of our officers should always be sought.
5.39 Proposals for tourist accommodation in the Green Belt will be considered 
against the relevant national policies and this Plan.
Self-catering Accommodation
5.40 Purpose-built self-catering accommodation has a similar impact on the 
environment to new permanent homes and we will consider such proposals in 
the same way.20 South Oxfordshire & Vale 
of White Horse Hotel Needs 
Assessment 2014.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020139
5.41 Where holiday accommodation is permitted, legal agreements may be used 
to ensure that the accommodation remains as holiday lets and permitted 
development rights may be withdrawn to protect the setting of the building.
Caravan and Camping Sites
Policy EMP12: Caravan and Camping Sites
1. Touring caravan and cam ping sites will be permitted provided that:
i) the proposed development has no adverse im pact on the 
landscape,   ecological or historic characteristics of the site and its 
surroundings;
ii) the proposed development would not cause any detrimental 
impact on the amenities of adjacent occupiers or the quiet 
informal enjoyment of the open countryside;
iii) where appropriate,   the site is accessible by public transport and 
provision is made for pedestrian and cycle links with adjacent 
areas;
iv) where possible,   associated facilities are sited in existing 
buildings;
v) where new buildings are essential these must be designed to a 
high standard,   be accessible to all and be sensitively sited; and
vi) the site is located outside Flood Zone 3.
2. Where permission is given,   it will normally be subject to a condition 
restricting the use to holiday accommodation only and the site may 
also be made subject to a seasonal occupancy condition. 
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 3, 6 & 7.
5.42 The use of land for touring caravans and camping can assist in farm diversification 
and help sustain the provision of services in rural areas. Such sites can be visually 
intrusive, particularly in the open countryside, and usually require a number of 
permanent buildings, such as reception areas and toilet blocks. Where possible, 
associated facilities should be sited in existing buildings. The Council will take a 
cautious approach to the provision of caravan and camping sites. However, the 
Council recognises that with imagination and care it may be possible to design 
and locate new sites that are discreet and respect the landscape. Sites that 
present a negative impact on the landscape will not be permitted.
5.43 Proposals within the Green Belt will be considered in accordance with relevant 140
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
national policies and this Plan. Care will need to be taken to ensure that 
proposals do not adversely affect Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and 
Conservation Areas. Sites should normally be located within walking distance 
of the main towns or larger villages which have a range of facilities and 
therefore reduce the need for visitors to travel. Adequate access to the site is 
particularly important where touring caravans are to be accommodated.
5.44 Caravan and camping sites will not be permitted in areas at highest risk from 
flooding. Where permission is granted for caravan and camping sites and 
flooding is an issue, planning conditions will be used to require an appropriate 
flood evacuation plan, including the erection of suitable flood warning notices.
5.45 A comprehensive landscaping scheme and management plan is fundamental 
to ensure no detrimental impact on the surrounding landscape. Care should be 
taken with the boundary treatment to ensure effective screening.
5.46 Touring caravans are not suitable for permanent occupation and their use will 
be restricted to holiday accommodation only. Change of use for part or all of a 
touring caravan site, or an extension to a touring caravan site to a permanent 
residential caravan site, is unlikely to be acceptable given the additional impact 
on the environment and the need for additional services and facilities. To 
reduce the visual impact of new touring caravan and camping sites and to 
prevent them being used throughout the year, the site may be made subject to 
a seasonal occupancy condition.
Visitor Accommodation
Policy EMP13: Retention of Visitor Accommodation
1. Development resulting in the loss of sites or premises used,   or last 
used,   as visitor accommodation will only be considered acceptable 
where it can be adequately demonstrated that the business is no 
longer viable and has no reasonable prospect of continuing and 
alternative visitor accommodation businesses have been fully 
explored.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 3 & 6.
5.47 Staying visitors are a particularly important element of the tourist economy. 
The retention of existing visitor accommodation is of great importance in 
providing a range of accommodation types across a variety of economic The retention of 
existing visitor 
accommodation 
is of great 
importanceSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020141groups, helps to attract a mix of visitors and provides support to businesses 
within the district.
5.48 It is important to control the loss of visitor accommodation to prevent the 
threat to the quality, quantity and choice of accommodation on offer across 
the district and the resulting negative effects on the district’s economy.
5.49 Viability evidence is required to be submitted as part of any proposal involving 
the loss of visitor accommodation. The information should be comprehensive 
and will often include detailed financial viability information, which may require 
the Council to seek specialist input to make an informed assessment. When 
assessing a proposal, consideration will be given to retaining and maintaining 
the direct economic benefit from income and employment generated for 
the district by visitor accommodation businesses and to maintain the indirect 
benefits through spending on goods and services.
5.50 Where a claim is made that the business is no longer viable, the Council must 
be satisfied that:
• the business has been run in a reasonable and professional manner by the 
proprietor;
• there has been a serious and sustained effort to run a visitor accommodation 
business in the premises using available business support services;
• the business has been actively market tested to potential purchasers of 
the business, with a guide price reflecting the going-concern value of 
the accommodation business (or its hotel/self-catering market value if 
not currently trading), normally for a minimum 18 months, and that no 
reasonable offers have been received during this time. The guide price 
must reflect the potential earnings of the business and the cost of essential 
works; alternative visitor accommodation business models have been 
explored and discounted;
• a forward business plan has been presented that shows the business is no 
longer viable. If the business has not operated recently, then a forward 
business plan must be presented with a clear demonstration that an 
attempt has been made to implement it; and
• any previous tourism/visitor related planning approval has been given a 
reasonable time to become commercially established and any claims that 
these changes are no longer financially viable must show the relationship 
between the original business planning and the current situation. The 
local planning authority will need to be satisfied that permitted enabling 
developments have supported the authorised provision of visitor 
accommodation.
5.51 Applicants should provide supporting information to demonstrate business 
activity for at least the last three years.

South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020143 INFRASTRUCTURE
Introduction 
6.1 Good connections and high quality infrastructure are essential to our quality 
of life. We need to travel to work, school, shops, leisure and health facilities. 
A thriving economy needs good connections to operate efficiently. These can 
range from the strategic road and rail network, to our ability to access the 
internet with the benefits that it can offer to work from home and provide 
services. Improving accessibility to services and employment is fundamental 
to sustainable development and to meeting the objectives of this Plan. The 
challenge is to do this in a way that minimises the impact of the transport 
system on the environment whilst encouraging development that actively 
supports walking, cycling and public transport to minimise the need to travel, 
and provides for necessary improvements in a cost- effective way.
6.2 Successful and sustainable communities depend upon physical, green, social 
and community infrastructure to meet the needs of residents and businesses. 
Infrastructure encompasses a very wide range of provision including transport, 
public utilities and waste management, flood management measures, social 
and community infrastructure such as affordable housing, health care facilities, 
emergency services provision and sports provision, Green Infrastructure, 
culture, faith and spiritual facilities, education, leisure and tourism, and other 
community facilities ranging from community meeting halls to children’s play 
areas.
6.3 It is important to appreciate that whilst there is a considerable degree of 
funding from governmental and other public sources, a significant amount of 
the money for provision of new or the enhancement of existing infrastructure 
comes in the form of financial contributions from developers or in the form of 
payment in kind through direct provision of facilities or services.
6.4 To better understand the suitability of existing infrastructure provision and 
identify the infrastructure required to support the level of development 
proposed through the Local Plan, South Oxfordshire District Council has 
developed an Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP). The IDP is an important 
element of the evidence for the Local Plan and helps inform and underpin 
strategic policies for growth and development. The IDP outlines in more 
detail the infrastructure requirements to support proposed development 
growth, particularly for strategic sites, as well as planned delivery and funding 
arrangements. It will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis during the 
plan period.6

143South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020144
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 20206.5 The location of all forms of development can be a key factor in influencing 
where and how we travel and reducing the need to travel and enabling 
sustainable travel options. These principles have a key influence on the other 
elements of the Plan. For example, accessibility to services and facilities and 
the availability of high quality, frequent and reliable public transport are key 
features for a strong network of settlements and the overall distribution of 
new housing and employment land.
6.6 The policies within this section contribute towards our vision and objectives 
which seek to build on opportunities for sustainable travel. They have been 
informed by relevant evidence, including our Evaluation of Transport Impacts 
work. However, we recognise that the rural nature of the district means that 
many residents will still be dependent on car travel for some or all of their 
journeys, and this is reflected in the policies below. This section of the Plan has 
also been informed by, and is consistent with, Oxfordshire County Council’s 
Local Transport Plan 421, which sets the transport policies and provides 
transport strategies for the county to 2031. Improving travel choice in rural 
areas is to be encouraged, while accepting that there is unlikely to be a single 
model for delivering the flexible and responsive transport services required to 
meet the diverse needs of rural communities.
Infrastructure Provision
 
6.7 Successful and sustainable communities and new developments depend 
on suitable physical and social infrastructure being in place to meet the 
needs of their residents. These needs include transport, utilities and waste, 
social infrastructure, environmental and Green Infrastructure, cultural, 
education, health, leisure, faith and community facilities. The level and type 
of infrastructure can range from major investments such as new schools, to 
support for community transport schemes.
6.8 It is also recognised that new development may need to take into account 
existing infrastructure constraints, such as the presence of overhead 
powerlines or gas pipelines. It will be important for developers to engage 
early on in the planning process with the organisations responsible for these 
distribution networks, currently either National Grid or Scottish and Southern 
Power Networks, to see how these can best be accommodated within new 
development. Urban design considerations will be important in determining 
how these networks can be taken into account, and agreements will need to 
be made with these organisations on any proposed modification, taking into 
account relevant guidance (https://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/electricity-
transmission/network-and-infrastructure/planning-and-development). It Improving travel 
choice in rural 
areas is to be

may be appropriate for any changes to be agreed at the planning application 
stage, for example, through appropriate conditions.
6.9 The need for, and importance of, providing adequate, appropriate and timely 
infrastructure is a strong message that comes from local residents during 
consultations, who are often concerned that the necessary infrastructure is not 
provided, or not provided quickly enough.
6.10 To maintain and provide infrastructure and other community services 
effectively, it is essential that there is a partnership working approach between 
the public, private and voluntary sector agencies involved. We will continue to 
work closely with a wide range of infrastructure providers and stakeholders. 
Key organisations include Oxfordshire County Council, Highways England, 
the NHS and Clinical Commissioning Groups, Town and Parish Councils, 
Thames Water and the Environment Agency. An example of this partnership 
work is the Oxfordshire Infrastructure Strategy work being undertaken for the 
Oxfordshire Growth Board, which has helped to evidence and map strategic 
infrastructure requirements for Oxfordshire over the next 15-20 years. This 
work has assisted in informing our Infrastructure Delivery Plan, which gives 
more detail on the infrastructure required to support the development 
proposed in the Plan. 
6.11 Where funding is secured for infrastructure, there will be an expectation 
that funding will be recovered and recycled and obtained from developer 
contributions retrospectively. Where forward funding is secured it will not 
circumvent the need for a development to contribute towards the cost of such 
infrastructure if such infrastructure is relevant to the development of the site. 
Infrastructure and services required as a consequence of development, and 
provision for their maintenance, will be sought from developers, and secured 
through developer contributions.
Policy INF1: Infrastructure Provision
1. New development must be served and supported by appropriate on-
site and off-site infrastructure and services.
2. Planning permission will only be granted for developments where 
the infrastructure and services needed to meet the needs of the 
new development are already in place or will be provided to an 
agreed timescale. Infrastructure includes the requirements set 
out in the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan,   Leisure Study,  146
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Green Infrastructure Strategy,   any relevant made Neighbourhood 
Development Plans,   and/or infrastructure needed to mitigate the 
impact of the new development.
3. Infrastructure and services,   required as a consequence of development,  
and provision for their maintenance,   will be sought from developers,  
and secured through planning obligations,   conditions attached to 
a planning permission,   other agreements,   and funding through the 
Council’s Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) or other mechanisms.
This applies equally where external funding for infrastructure 
necessary for development has been secured (including where the 
infrastructure is delivered ahead of development),   on the expectation 
that funding shall be recovered from development.
4. Development will also need to take account of existing infrastructure,  
such as sewerage treatment works,   electricity pylons or gas 
pipelines running across development sites. Early engagement with 
infrastructure providers will be necessary,   with any changes set 
down and agreed at planning application stage,   for example through 
planning conditions.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 4, & 6.
Transport
Strategic Transport Infrastructure
6.12 As the highway authority, Oxfordshire County Council manages and maintains 
the local road network and prepares a countywide Local Transport Plan which 
sets out policies and strategies for developing the transport system across 
the county. Highways England is the government company charged with 
operating, maintaining and improving England’s motorways and major A 
roads, including the M40 and A34. Network Rail owns the railway network, 
with train operating companies, mainly Great Western Railway, providing 
services. In association with the bus companies, this provides a network of 
public transport services providing sustainable transport choices across the 
district.
6.13 The Council works with our partners including neighbouring authorities, 
Highways England and the National Infrastructure Commission to reflect, South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020147support and enable the implementation of transport objectives through land-
use policies and proposals. In particular, we recognise the work undertaken 
by the National Infrastructure Commission on developing plans for the Oxford 
to Cambridge Arc, their recommendations on progressing growth along this 
corridor as set out in their 2017 report ‘Partnering for Prosperity: a new deal 
for the Cambridge-Milton Keynes-Oxford Arc’ and the Government response 
to this report in the Autumn 2018 budget22.
6.14  The Local Plan will make a positive contribution towards delivering the ambitions 
set out for the Oxford to Cambridge Arc. It is recognised that a key infrastructure 
scheme, the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway, was paused by Government in 
March 2020 for further work to be undertaken on other potential road projects 
that could support the Government’s ambition for the Oxford-Cambridge Arc. 
Whilst there is some uncertainty on these matters, the Council will continue 
to work positively with others on the development of this infrastructure, and 
understanding potential impacts, including linkages with development proposed 
in this Plan.
6.15 All development influences travel patterns either through new trips on the network 
or the re-routing of existing trips. Oxfordshire is relatively self contained in terms of 
trips and the level of travel to work trips made within the County is approximately 
70%. Major locations of employment include Science Vale in the central area of 
the district around Didcot, with links to employment at Oxford to the north of the 
district and Reading and the Thames Valley to the south of the district. The main 
requirements of national policy relating to transport are to reduce the need to 
travel, promote more sustainable modes of transport, and improve accessibility. 
The location of all forms of development is therefore very important.

Policy TRANS1a: Supporting Strategic Transport 
Investment Across the Oxford to Cambridge Arc
1. The Council will work with Network Rail,   Highways England,   the 
National Infrastructure Commission,   Oxfordshire County Council and 
others to:
i) plan for,   and understand the impacts of changes to rail 
infrastructure and service improvements linked to East-West rail; 
and
ii) plan for,   and understand impacts and required mitigation 
associated with the Oxford to Cambridge Arc. 
This policy contributes towards achieving objective 4
Policy TRANS1b: Supporting Strategic Transport Investment
1. The Council will work with Oxfordshire County Council and others to:
i) deliver the transport infrastructure which improves movement 
in and around Didcot,   including measures that help support 
delivery of the Didcot Garden Town;
ii) support measures identified in the Local Transport Plan for the 
district including within the relevant area strategies;
iii) support sustainable transport measures that improve access to/
from proposed major development around Oxford;
iv) support delivery of the safeguarded transport improvements as 
required to help deliver the development required in this plan 
period and beyond;
v) ensure that the impacts of new development on the strategic 
and local road network,   including the A34 and M40,   are 
adequately mitigated;
vi) plan for improvements in the Reading area,   including a proposal 
for a new River Thames crossing,   subject to ensuring that any 
traffic and environmental impacts of those measures do not 
result in adverse impacts on South Oxfordshire;
vii) support the development and delivery of a new Thames River 
crossing between Culham and Didcot Garden Town,   the A4130 
widening and road safety improvements from the A34 Milton 
Interchange to Didcot,   a Science Bridge over the A4130 and 
railway into the former Didcot A power station site and the 
Clifton Hampden Bypass;South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020149
viii) support,   in association with major development,   the delivery of 
new or improved roads,   such as a bypass or edge road,   including 
sustainable transport improvements,   linked where appropriate 
with relevant Neighbourhood Development Plans and any wider 
County Council highway infrastructure strategy; and
ix) support the delivery of the Cowley Branch Line.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 4, 6 & 8.
6.16 To enable delivery of transport network improvements required to bring 
forward new development, there will be a need for on-going positive 
engagement with infrastructure providers throughout the plan period. 
Oxfordshire County Council have published their Local Transport Plan 4 (LTP4), 
and it will be important that, as far as possible, the Local Plan supports delivery 
of identified schemes to improve highway and public transport networks. The 
LTP4 also supports promotion of sustainable travel, particularly within more 
built-up areas such as Didcot and around Oxford. New development can help 
fund and enable the provision of new public transport, walking and cycle links 
between homes, jobs, shops and other facilities such as health centres and 
help tackle climate change. In Didcot, development of sustainable transport 
improvements will need to align to development of the Didcot Garden Town. 
Around Oxford, the proposed major development will need to positively 
support delivery of measures within the Oxford Transport Strategy.
6.17 Road and rail connections within and through South Oxfordshire are currently 
experiencing significant growth in demand because of strong economic growth. 
This is set to continue as new homes and jobs come forward in the district 
and the surrounding areas. Significant new investment is already taking place, 
such as upgrades to junctions on the A34 Trunk Road, and electrification of 
the Great Western Mainline. However, current studies being undertaken by 
Network Rail and Highways England indicate that these will only cater for part 
of the forecast increase in demand for travel. Further options for road and rail 
investment are therefore being considered in more detail, linked to the plans 
for growth across the Oxford to Cambridge Arc23. The Council will need to 
continue to engage with national and local partners to explore and plan for 
both the economic benefits and environmental impacts of these proposals.
Policy TRANS2: Promoting Sustainable Transport and 
Accessibility
1. The Council will work with Oxfordshire County Council and others to:23 www.gov.uk/government/

study-stage-3-report and 
www.gov.uk/government/
publications/autumn-statement-

South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
i) ensure that where new development is located close to,   or 
along,   existing strategic public transport corridors,   bus and/or 
rail services can be promoted and strengthened in response to 
increases in demand for travel and freight;
ii) plan positively for rail improvements within the area that 
support improved connectivity to areas of new development;
iii) ensure new development is designed to encourage walking and 
cycling,   not only within the development,   but also to nearby 
facilities,   employment and public transport hubs;
iv) support provision of measures which improve public transport 
(including Park & Ride),   cycling and walking networks within 
and between towns and villages in the district;
v) support,   where relevant,   sustainable transport improvements in 
the wider Didcot Garden Town area and in and around Oxford,  
particularly where they improve access to strategic development 
locations;
vi) promote and support improvements to the transport network 
which increase safety,   improve air quality,   encourage use of 
sustainable modes of transport and/or make our towns and 
villages more attractive;
vii) adopt an approach to the provision and management of car 
parking aimed at improving the attraction of our town and 
village centres; and
viii) ensure the needs of all users,   including those with impaired 
mobility are planned for in development of transport 
improvements.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 4, 6 & 8.
6.18 It is recognised that new development can have both a positive role in 
improving and funding sustainable transport network connections, and also 
through the provision of good urban design to encourage walking and cycling 
from new development to shops, schools and other facilities. This will be 
particularly important in significant growth areas including Didcot Garden 
Town, where the Council will work with the Vale of White Horse District 
Council, to ensure that plans for cross border development and infrastructure 
are co-ordinated appropriately.
6.19 In Neighbourhood Development Plan areas, it will be important to ensure 
that sustainable transport movements are incorporated into Neighbourhood 
Development Plans. These improvements will also need to be complemented South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020151
by relevant and reasonable upgrades to surrounding highway networks to 
mitigate impacts of development, which should include taking into account air 
quality considerations where relevant. The provision and management of car 
parks will be key given that within a rural district such as South Oxfordshire 
the car will continue to play a role in providing transport accessibility for 
many. It will also be important to ensure the sustainable transport network 
around Oxford is strengthened and improved to take account of the proposed 
strategic development here.
6.20 To enable further delivery of key transport infrastructure that will support 
development within the Plan, there is a need to safeguard land to ensure 
that any proposals for development do not prejudice their future delivery. 
Those schemes identified as needing land for safeguarding will help support 
the delivery of Local Plan growth, particularly in the Didcot area where they 
will also support committed growth in the Vale of White Horse District. At 
present, some of these schemes are at relatively early stages of development 
and therefore areas of safeguarding are relatively broad. The district will 
continue to work in association with others, including Oxfordshire County 
Council to develop these schemes in more detail, including understanding any 
environmental and archaeological impacts and associated mitigation.
 
Policy TRANS3: Safeguarding of Land for Strategic 
Transport Schemes
1. Land is safeguarded to support the delivery of the following identified 
transport schemes:
• Clifton Hampden bypass
• A new Thames River crossing between Culham and Didcot Garden 
Town
• Didcot Northern Perimeter Road
• Science Bridge,   Didcot
• (A4130/ B4493) Didcot Central transport corridor improvements
• Southern Didcot Spine Road
• A4130 road safety improvements
• A4074/ B4015 (Golden Balls) junction improvements
• A bypass for Watlington
• A bypass for Benson
• A bypass for Southern Abingdon
• A new Park and Ride site at Sandford to the south-east of Oxford.
2. New development in these areas should be carefully designed The provision 
and management 
of car parks will 
be key given 
that within a 
rural district 
such as South 
Oxfordshire the 
car will continue 
to play a role 
in providing 
transport 
accessibility for 
many152
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
having regard to matters such as building layout,   noise insulation,   
landscaping,   the historic environment and means of access.
3. Any proposals for development that may reasonably be considered 
to impact upon the delivery of the identified schemes should 
demonstrate the proposal would not harm their delivery.
4. Planning permission will not be granted for development that would 
prejudice the construction or effective operation of the transport 
schemes listed above.
5. As the options for the schemes progress,   the impact of the schemes 
will be subject to thorough assessment. This will include full 
environmental and archaeological assessments working in association 
with the relevant statutory bodies. Where schemes are located in 
areas of Flood Zones 2 and 3,   a flood risk sequential test and the 
exception test should be undertaken as part of the appraisal process.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 4, 6, 7 & 8.
6.21 Transport infrastructure improvements will be required to support the demand 
for travel arising from proposed new development, and the need for new 
measures will be informed by transport evidence which supports the Local Plan 
growth strategy. The Council will therefore continue to work with partners, 
including Oxfordshire County Council, to assess requirements through 
use of transport modelling tools and assessment of sustainable transport 
improvements. The evidence developed to date has identified the benefits 
of delivering a number of key highway infrastructure schemes, as well as 
several sustainable transport improvements24. This, in turn, builds on priorities 
identified in the Local Transport Plan 4, including the Science Vale Area 
Transport Strategy25.
6.22 Plans which illustrate the extent of the safeguarded transport schemes 
identified in policy TRANS3 are shown in Appendix 5.
Transport Assessments, Transport Statements and Travel 
Plans
6.23  As new development comes forward, there will be a need to look in more 
detail at the specific transport and access impacts associated with individual 
sites. Where such developments would generate significant amounts of 24 The Evaluation of Traffic 
Impacts and the Sustainable 
Transport Studies
25 www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/cms/
content/ltp4-area-strategiesSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020153
travel, a Transport Assessment will be needed. The determination of whether 
significant amounts of travel are generated will be dealt with on a case by case 
basis. This will need to review both the transport implications of development, 
as well as appropriate mitigation. Especially important will be promotion 
of measures that enable sustainable transport choices, and where relevant 
a Travel Plan will be required to demonstrate how such measures will be 
delivered.
6.24 The scoping of Transport Assessments should be done in agreement with 
Oxfordshire County Council as the highway authority, and be in line with latest 
County and Planning Practice Guidance26. It is also important that applicants 
take account of requirements for infrastructure in the area as set out in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan, which will be reviewed and updated as required. 
In the scoping of transport impacts, there will also need to be consideration 
of the development site’s location, recognising that in more rural areas the 
opportunity for take up of sustainable transport choices may be less, and that 
more innovative measures may be needed. In addition, there may be a need 
to take account of the cumulative impacts of development, for example where 
this relates to delivery of particular infrastructure improvements.
Policy TRANS4: Transport Assessments, Transport 
Statements and Travel Plans 
1. Proposals for new developments which have significant transport 
implications that either arise from the development proposed or 
cumulatively with other proposals will need to submit a Transport 
Assessment or a Transport Statement,   and where relevant a Travel 
Plan. These documents will need to take into account Oxfordshire 
County Council guidance and Planning Practice Guidance27 and where 
appropriate,   the scope should be agreed with Highways England28.
2. Appropriate provision for works and/or contributions will be required 
towards providing an adequate level of accessibility by all modes 
of transport and mitigating the impacts on the transport network. 
Consideration should be given to the cumulative impact of relevant 
development both in South Oxfordshire and adjacent authorities,  
and how this links to planned infrastructure improvements. This 
should take into account the latest evidence base work,   which,   where 
relevant,   will inform the scoping of the Transport Assessment and 
Travel Plan.26 http://planningguidance.

3. The Transport Assessment or Transport Statement should,   where 
relevant: 
i) illustrate accessibility to the site by all modes of transport;
ii) show the likely modal split of journeys to and from the site;
iii) detail the proposed measures to improve access by public 
transport,   cycling and walking to reduce the need for car travel 
and reduce transport impacts;
iv) illustrate the impact on the highway network and the impact of 
proposed mitigation measures where necessary;
v) include a Travel Plan (that considers all relevant forms of 
transport including accessible transport for disabled people) 
where appropriate; and
vi) outline the approach to parking provision.
4. Where relevant,   evidence obtained from this detailed work will inform 
the number and phasing of homes to be permitted on proposed 
development sites and will be established (and potentially conditioned) 
through the planning application process,   in consultation with the 
highway authority.
5. In accordance with the guidance,   Travel Plans will be required,  
implemented and monitored for all developments that will generate 
significant amounts of movement.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 4, 6 & 8.
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020155
6.25 In planning for new development, there are several key considerations in 
relation to transport access and movement that need to be accommodated 
at both the design and delivery stage. For most new development, this will 
be looked at as part of the Transport Assessment, and, where relevant, a site 
Travel Plan. The Travel Plan will need to take into account the needs of all 
those travelling to/from the new development, including disabled people, and 
their need for accessible transport. Transport also needs careful consideration 
as part of the wider master planning and site design development. For 
example, how parking provision is planned and delivered will need to take 
account of the urban design principles set out in Chapter 8 of the Plan. 
6.26 Promotion of sustainable transport access and provision of on-site facilities will 
also need to take account of wider environmental impacts and issues such as 
air quality, particularly where Air Quality Management Areas are in place.
Policy TRANS5: Consideration of Development Proposals
1. Proposals for all types of development will,   where appropriate:
i) provide for a safe and convenient access for all users to the 
highway network;
ii) provide safe and convenient routes for cyclists and pedestrians,  
both within the development,   and including links to rights 
of way and other off-site walking and cycling routes where 
relevant;
iii) provide for covered,   secure and safe cycle parking,   
complemented by other facilities to support cycling where 
relevant;
iv) be designed to facilitate access to high quality public transport 
routes,   including safe walking routes to nearby bus stops or new 
bus stops;
v) provide for appropriate public transport infrastructure;
vi) be served by an adequate road network which can 
accommodate traffic without creating traffic hazards or damage 
to the environment;
vii) where new roads,   pedestrian routes,   cycleways and street 
lighting are to be constructed as part of the development,   they 
should be constructed to adoptable standards and be completed 
as soon as they are required to serve the development; 
viii) make adequate provision for those whose mobility is impaired;
ix) be designed to enable charging of plug-in and other low-
emission vehicles in safe,   accessible and convenient locations;
x) provide for loading,   unloading,   circulation and turning space;156
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
xi) be designed to enable the servicing of properties by refuse 
collection vehicles;
xii) provide for parking for disabled people;
xiii) provide for the parking of vehicles in accordance with 
Oxfordshire County Council parking standards,   unless specific 
evidence is provided to justify otherwise; and
xiv) provide facilities to support the take up of electric and/or low-
emission vehicles.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 4, 6, 7 & 8.
6.27 Demand for use of rail services is growing strongly, and there are plans to 
significantly improve rail services operating to and through South Oxfordshire29. 
In the short-term, there is a focus on enhancing rail services to Didcot, 
complemented by measures to expand the station and improve access by car, 
bus, walking and cycling. Any upgrades in this area will need to take account 
of proposals developed as part of Didcot Garden Town Delivery Plan. In the 
longer-term there is likely to be a need for upgrades at Culham and other 
smaller stations such as Cholsey and Goring-on-Thames in association with 
significant infrastructure investment and to serve new areas of homes and jobs. 
At a strategic level, this needs to be informed by assessment of capacity and 
options for improvements across Oxfordshire and the wider area. Examples of 
upgrades could be expansion or enhancements of car or cycle parking, and 
are likely to be informed by development of Station Travel Plans. There will be 
a need to ensure that such improvements are delivered in a way that do not 
significantly impact on the environment or surrounding residential areas.
Policy TRANS6: Rail
1. Where required,   and not covered within the scope of permitted 
development,   planning permission will be granted for proposals 
which:
i) improve rail services in South Oxfordshire;
ii) improve access to rail services including for disabled people; and/
or
iii) improve facilities at railway stations such as car and cycle 
parking and upgrades to interchanges provided that there are 
no significant adverse effects on the environment or amenities 
of residents.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 4, & 6.29 www.networkrail.co.uk/
wp-content/uploads/2016/11/
Western-Route-Study-Final-1.pdfSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020157
6.28 It is recognised that development that results in significant increases in the 
movements of lorries, such as logistics operations needs careful consideration 
in planning terms, and that in general these types of operations are more 
appropriate in locations with good access to strategic transport networks. 
Detailed transport assessment work will need to be undertaken to understand 
environmental impacts and appropriate mitigation, and wherever possible 
sustainable transport access should be promoted for staff and visitors.
Policy TRANS7: Development Generating New Lorry 
Movements
1. Proposals for development leading to significant increases in lorry 
movements,   such as freight distribution depots should only be 
permitted in locations where:
i) any increase in lorry movements can be appropriately 
accommodated on the surrounding road network; 
ii) the opportunities for sustainable transport access have been 
maximised; and
iii) the development does not result in adverse environmental 
effects on the surrounding area.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 4, 6, 7 & 8.
6.29 Provision of improved electronic communication across the district and to new 
development will be critical to supporting continued economic development 
in the district, and supporting growth of high-tech industries. In line with the 
outcome of the central Government’s ‘Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review’ 
and section 10 of the National Planning Policy Framework, there will be in 
particular a need to provide full fibre broadband to new development coming 
forward over the next few years30. From a transport perspective, provision 
of high quality broadband will also be important in supporting new ways of 
working such as flexible hours and working at home that help reduce pressure 
on the transport network, particularly at peak times, and support the vitality of 
our towns and villages.30 https://www.gov.uk/

Communications 
Policy INF2: Electronic Communications
1. The Council will work with Oxfordshire County Council and others to 
promote faster,   more reliable and more comprehensive coverage of 
electronic communications.
2. Proposals for all new development should ensure appropriate 
infrastructure is provided during construction,   sufficient to enable all 
development to be connected to full fibre broadband without any 
post development works.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 4, 6 & 8.
6.30 The availability of advanced ICT infrastructure including high-speed broadband 
access is important for the success of the local economy and skills development.
 
Policy INF3: Telecommunications Technology
1. In accordance with Government advice,   if a proposed installation 
meets the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation 
Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for public exposure then it will not be 
necessary to consider further health aspects and concerns.
2. Prior approval (or planning permission where required) for the siting 
and appearance of antennae will be granted for telecommunications 
installations provided that the following criteria are met:
i) the siting and appearance of the proposed apparatus and 
associated structures should seek to minimise impact on the 
visual amenity,   character or appearance of the surrounding 
area in accordance with design policies and where appropriate 
heritage and/or ecological policies;
ii) if on a building,   apparatus and associated structures should be 
sited and designed to seek to minimise impact to the external 
appearance of the host building;
iii) if proposing a new mast,   it should be demonstrated that the 
applicant has fully explored the possibility of erecting apparatus South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020159
on existing buildings,   masts or other structures; and 
iv) when considering applications for telecommunications 
development,   the Council will have regard to the operational 
requirements of telecommunications networks and the technical 
limitations of the technology.
3. Any planning permission will contain conditions to ensure that when 
any facility ceases to be used,   becomes obsolete,   or falls into disrepair,  
the demolition and removal of all works is undertaken,   both above 
and below ground,   and the reinstatement of the site to its original 
condition or to an agreed specification,   will be required.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 4, 5, 6 & 7.
6.31 Telecommunications are of great importance to the economy and we need 
to accommodate the growth of new and existing systems. However, owing 
to the potentially obtrusive nature of telecommunication installations, 
wherever legally and technically possible, we will encourage the sharing of 
existing masts, buildings and other structures such as electricity pylons to limit 
the proliferation of unsightly development, particularly in visually sensitive 
locations. To achieve this, we will encourage pre-development and pre- 
application discussions between operators and will expect confirmation that 
the cumulative exposure will not exceed the International Commission on Non- 
Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) standards. Where the sharing of a mast 
will require it to be extended, we may consider the sharing of an existing site 
to be preferable in environmental and visual amenity terms. In proving a need 
for new telecommunications development, applications should be supported 
by technical evidence such as radio coverage plots.
6.32 The future telecommunication requirements of a new development should 
be given careful consideration at the design stage to minimise visual 
intrusion, not adversely affect the amenity of nearby residents, allow for 
easy maintenance and future growth. In addition, careful consideration 
will need to be given to any impacts on archaeological sites, conservation 
areas or buildings of architectural or historic significance. Applicants will be 
expected to demonstrate that there are no suitable alternative locations before 
consideration will be given to proposals within Areas of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty. Because telecommunications is a rapidly expanding and evolving 
technology it can become obsolete. Redundant apparatus should be removed.In addition, 
careful 
consideration will 
need to be given 
to any impacts 
on archaeological 
sites, 
conservation

Water
Policy INF4: Water Resources
1. All development proposals must demonstrate that there is or will be 
adequate water supply,   surface water,   foul drainage and sewerage 
treatment capacity to serve the whole development. Applicants will 
be required to demonstrate that there is adequate capacity both on 
and off site to serve the development and that it would not lead to 
problems for existing users. When there is a capacity constraint and 
improvements to off-site infrastructure are not programmed,   the 
developer should set out how the infrastructure improvements will 
be completed prior to occupation of the development. For phased 
development proposals,   each phase must demonstrate sufficient 
water supply and water treatment capacity.
2. New developments are required to be designed to a water efficiency 
standard of 110 litres/head/day (l/h/d) for new homes.
3. Proposals that increase the requirement for water will only be 
permitted where adequate water resources either already exist or 
can be provided without detriment to existing abstraction,   river flows,  
groundwater flow to and from springs,   water quality,   biodiversity or 
other land uses.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 4, 6, 7 & 8.
6.33 Demand for water in the district continues to increase and it is appropriate, 
therefore, that new development minimises the pressure on existing resources. 
Measures to reduce the demand for water should be incorporated into 
new development. Where there is an adverse impact on water resources, 
including groundwater, planning conditions and planning obligations may 
be imposed to mitigate the adverse effects of the development and to secure 
water conservation measures. The Water Cycle Study identifies areas of South 
Oxfordshire where water supply and/or wastewater infrastructure or treatment 
upgrades are required to serve proposed growth. These constraints, and the 
timing of measures to address them, should be taken into account when 
phasing new development. This is particularly important for development 
within Chalgrove, Didcot, Thame, Wheatley and around Oxford which have 
been identified as having significant constraints.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 20201616.34 Thames Water is the water and wastewater service provider for South 
Oxfordshire. Thames Water is responsible for the planning and implementation 
required to provide a secure supply of water to their customers which supports 
future growth. Thames Water will therefore advise on the capacity of their 
network to supply water to a new development. The Environment Agency has 
a wider role to regulate the use of water and licenses water for use by private 
abstractors and water companies. The Council will continue to work with both 
organisations to ensure water matters are appropriately evidenced and taken 
account of in growth plans.162

South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020163NATURAL AND HISTORIC 
ENVIRONMENT
Introduction
 7.1 South Oxfordshire has a beautiful natural and built environment, which makes 
the district an attractive place to live and work. This environment also attracts 
visitors who contribute to the local economy.
 7.2 The landscape of the district includes rolling downland, wooded hills, ancient 
woodlands, historic parkland, low-lying farmland, riverside meadows and 
strategic environmental assets including the North Wessex Downs and the 
Chilterns AONB, the Green Belt and the River Thames and its tributaries. We 
encourage effective management of the AONB and the Green Belt.
 7.3 The whole district is rich in biodiversity, including international, national and 
locally protected sites and habitats and forms a part of a wider ecological 
network across the County.  Maintaining sustainable agricultural land and 
practices is important in preserving the district’s rural character and landscape.
7.4 The valley and tributaries of the River Thames are highly attractive features of the 
landscape and its special visual and environmental qualities are for the most part 
unspoilt. The Thames Valley is noted for its peace, tranquillity, biodiversity and 
cultural heritage, which is essential to preserve. The long-distance Thames Path 
and the river itself provide a focus for recreation and leisure activities.
7.5 We will seek to ensure that the planning and design of development not only 
protects water supply and quality, but also protects and, where appropriate 
restores, natural river form and function, whilst maximising resistance and 
resilience to flood risk.
7.6 The district has a rich cultural history that has provided South Oxfordshire with 
over 3,500 listed buildings, 52 Scheduled Monuments, 13 Registered Parks and 
Gardens, a Registered Battlefield, and 72 Conservation Areas. Sadly in 2020 
there are 14 sites on the Heritage at Risk Register. Parts of the district’s natural 
environment and many historic assets are of national significance. These 
heritage assets31 help establish the distinctive character of South Oxfordshire. 
We seek to ensure the conservation, enhancement, enjoyment and 
understanding of all our heritage assets as they make a positive contribution to 
sustainable communities, including their economic vitality.

nationally protected historic 
buildings is available on the 
Historic England website (www.

Landscape and Countryside 
Policy ENV1: Landscape and Countryside
1. The highest level of protection will be given to the landscape and 
scenic beauty of the Chilterns and North Wessex Downs Areas of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs):
• Development in an AONB or affecting the setting of an AONB 
will only be permitted where it conserves,   and where possible,  
enhances the character and natural beauty of the AONB;
• Development in an AONB will only be permitted where it is 
appropriate to the economic and environmental wellbeing of the 
area or promotes understanding or enjoyment of the AONB;
• Major development in an AONB will only be permitted in 
exceptional circumstances and where it can be demonstrated to 
be in the public interest; and
• Development proposals that could affect the special qualities of 
an AONB (including the setting of an AONB) either individually or 
in combination with other developments,   should be accompanied 
by a proportionate Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment. 
AONB Management Plans will be a material consideration in decision 
making.
2. South Oxfordshire’s landscape,   countryside and rural areas will be 
protected against harmful development. Development will only be 
permitted where it protects and,   where possible enhances,   features 
that contribute to the nature and quality of South Oxfordshire’s 
landscapes,   in particular:
i) trees (including individual trees,   groups of trees and woodlands),  
hedgerows and field boundaries;
ii) irreplaceable habitats such as ancient woodland and aged or 
veteran trees found outside ancient woodland;
iii) the landscapes,   waterscapes,   cultural heritage and user 
enjoyment of the River Thames,   its tributaries and flood plains;
iv) other watercourse and water bodies;
v) the landscape setting of settlements or the special character and 
landscape setting of Oxford;
vi) topographical features;
vii) areas or features of cultural and historic value;
viii) important views and visually sensitive skylines; and166
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
ix) aesthetic and perceptual factors such as tranquility,   wildness,  
intactness,   rarity and enclosure. 
3. Development which supports economic growth in rural areas will 
be supported provided it conserves and enhances the landscape,  
countryside and rural areas.
4. The Council will seek the retention of important hedgerows. Where 
retention is not possible and a proposal seeks the removal of a 
hedgerow,   the Council will require compensatory planting with a 
mixture of native hedgerow species.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.
7.7 South Oxfordshire is a mainly rural district. Mid-year population estimates for 
2014 from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) rank the district as 249th out 
of 326 districts in terms of population density, with an average of 202 people 
per square kilometre (the national average for England is 417 people per 
square kilometre).
7.8 The countryside and its relationship with our settlements contributes 
significantly to the district’s character and is highly valued. Development should 
conserve and where possible, enhance the landscape setting of settlements. 
The Council will use its evidence base on the district’s landscape which 
currently includes the Landscape Character Assessment, Landscape Capacity 
Assessments and the Oxfordshire Historic Landscape Characterisation Project, 
to assess and determine development proposals.
7.9 Whilst supporting suitably located and designed development necessary to 
facilitate the economic and social well-being of local communities, great 
weight is given to conserving and enhancing the intrinsic character and beauty 
of our Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which have the highest status 
of protection. Significant weight is also given to protecting non-designated 
landscapes, the countryside and Green Infrastructure assets from harm.
Trees and Hedgerows in the Landscape
7.10 Trees and hedgerows, individually and collectively, can make an important 
contribution to biodiversity and the landscape. They also absorb atmospheric 
pollution and have a beneficial influence on the climate. Development 
proposals should provide a net increase in tree canopy cover where this is Significant

possible, having regard to other considerations including site size, heritage 
protection, landscape character, habitat protection, residential amenity, and 
the need to make the best use of land.  
7.11 The Council will protect trees of significant amenity value which are worthy 
of retention and considered to be at risk, through Tree Preservation Orders, 
Conservation Areas and planning conditions as appropriate, except in 
woodland subject to a Forestry Commission management agreement. When 
considering applications to carry out work to trees protected by an Order 
or Conservation Area, the Council will take account of good arboricultural 
practice, the effect of the trees on nearby properties, and the contribution they 
make to the visual quality of the area.
Biodiversity
Policy ENV2: Biodiversity - Designated Sites, Priority 
Habitats and Species
1. The highest level of protection will be given to sites of international 
nature conservation importance (Special Areas of Conservation). 
Development that is likely to result in a significant effect,   either alone 
or in combination,   on such sites will need to satisfy the requirements 
of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (as 
amended).
2. Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) are of national importance. 
Development that is likely to have an adverse effect on a SSSI (either 
on its own or in combination with other developments) will only be 
permitted in exceptional circumstances,   where it can be demonstrated 
that the benefits of the development in the location proposed clearly 
outweigh any harm to the special interest features and the SSSI’s 
contribution to the local ecological network. In such circumstances,  
measures should be provided (and secured through planning 
conditions or legal agreements) that would mitigate or,   as a last resort,  
compensate for the adverse effects resulting from development.
3. Development likely to result,   either directly or indirectly to the loss,  
deterioration or harm to:
• Local Wildlife Sites
• Local Nature Reserves
• Priority Habitats and Species168
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
• Legally Protected Species
• Local Geological Sites
• Ecological Networks (Conservation Target Areas)
• Important or ancient hedges or hedgerows
• Ancient woodland and veteran trees
 will only be permitted if:
i) the need for,   and benefits of the development in the proposed 
location outweigh the adverse effect on the interests;
ii) it can be demonstrated that it could not reasonably be located 
on an alternative site that would result in less or no harm to the 
interests; and
iii) measures will be provided (and secured through planning 
conditions or legal agreements),   that would avoid,   mitigate or as 
a last resort,   compensate for the adverse effects resulting from 
development.
4. Development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable 
habitats (such as ancient woodland and ancient or veteran trees) will 
be refused planning permission,   unless there are wholly exceptional 
reasons justifying the granting of planning permission.
5. Where development has the potential to affect a proposed wildlife 
site the developer must undertake surveys and assessments to 
determine whether the site meets the criteria for Local Wildlife Site 
status.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 6, 7 & 8.
7.12 The level of protection and mitigation should be proportionate to the status 
of the habitat or species and its importance individually and as part of a wider 
network. 
Policy ENV3: Biodiversity 
1. Development that will conserve,   restore and enhance biodiversity 
in the district will be supported. All development should provide a 
net gain in biodiversity where possible. As a minimum,   there should 
be no net loss of biodiversity. All proposals should be supported by 
evidence to demonstrate a biodiversity net gain using a recognised 
biodiversity accounting metric.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020169
2. Development proposals which would result in a net loss of 
biodiversity will only be considered if it can be demonstrated that 
alternatives which avoid impacts on biodiversity have been fully 
explored in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy*. In the absence 
of alternative sites or layouts,   development proposals must include 
adequate mitigation measures to achieve a net gain of biodiversity. 
Where harm cannot be prevented or adequately mitigated,  
appropriate compensation measures will be sought,   as a last resort,  
through planning conditions or planning obligations (depending 
on the circumstances of each application) to offset the loss by 
contributing to appropriate biodiversity projects to achieve an overall 
net gain for biodiversity.
3. Planning permission will only be granted if impacts on biodiversity 
can be avoided,   mitigated or,   as a last resort,   compensated fully.
*For more information please refer to section 5.2 of BS 42020:2013
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 6, 7 & 8.
7.13  Adequate information must be provided, prior to planning decisions being 
made, to assess the impact on biodiversity where reasonably likely to occur. 
The use of conditions to require the submission of ecological information, after 
the grant of planning permission, will only be considered in wholly exceptional 
circumstances where the need for such surveys could not have reasonably been 
foreseen by the applicant or the Council.
 
7.14 South Oxfordshire supports a rich variety of natural habitats and species. Many 
of these habitats are of national and international significance. These include:
 Table 8a: Natural habitats and species
 International 4 Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)
 National 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
 Local 150 confirmed or proposed Local Wildlife Sites33 
  4 Local Nature Reserves
  5 Local Geological Sites
7.15 In addition, there are numerous other important natural habitats, which are 
priority habitats of principal importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity 
(under Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act)34.
7.16 In Oxfordshire a series of Conservation Target Areas (CTA)35 have been identified 33 A current list of Local Wildlife 
Sites is available on the Thames 
Valley Environmental Records 
Centre website (www.tverc.
org/cms/). The list is updated 
periodically so should be 
referred to for the most up to 
date list of conservation sites

35 www.wildoxfordshire.org.uk/
biodiversity/conservation-target-
areas/170

which form the Ecological Network for the County. The CTA provide the 
best opportunities for targeted conservation action. They connect and buffer 
important habitats and species assemblages and have been designed to provide 
resilience to future climate change. Development proposals that would affect the 
integrity of these networks will be resisted or discouraged.
7.17 Development should contribute to the conservation of ecological networks, 
protected sites and priority habitats. All development should consider how it can 
improve biodiversity, and loss can only be permitted when there are unavoidable 
impacts that cannot be mitigated and compensation is provided to achieve a 
net gain. We will apply a form of Biodiversity Accounting to help understand if 
development proposals will achieve no net loss.
Biodiversity: Watercourses
Policy ENV4: Watercourses
1. Development of land that contains or is adjacent to a watercourse 
must protect and where possible,   enhance the function and setting 
of the watercourse and its biodiversity. As a last resort development 
should provide mitigation for any unavoidable impacts.
2. Development should include a minimum 10m buffer zone along 
both sides of the watercourse to create a corridor favourable to the 
enhancement of biodiversity. Where a 10m wide buffer zone is not 
considered possible by the local planning authority,   (for example in 
dense urban areas where existing development comes closer to the 
watercourse) a smaller buffer zone may be allowed,   but should still be 
accompanied by detailed plans to show how the land will be used to 
promote biodiversity and how maintenance access to the watercourse 
will be created. Wherever possible within settlements a minimum 10m 
buffer should be maintained.
3. Proposals should avoid the culverting of any watercourse. 
Opportunities taken to remove culverts will be supported.
4. Outside settlements,   proposals for mooring stages will not be 
permitted. Proposals for posts,   earthworks or facing riverbanks with 
piles and planking will not be permitted except under exceptional 
circumstances and in agreement with the Environment Agency. Where 
it is necessary to protect a riverbank from erosion,   the protective 
measures must be designed to maintain and enhance the special South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020171
character of the river and its environment,   including its biodiversity.
5. Major development proposals which are located within 20m of a 
watercourse will require a Construction Management Plan to be 
agreed with the Council before commencement of work to ensure 
that the watercourse will be satisfactorily protected from damage,  
disturbance or pollution.
6. Sites for new development with existing culverts will be expected to 
investigate the feasibility of de-culverting the watercourse. Where 
bridges are proposed as an alternative to culverting,   the construction 
method should take into account the importance of maintaining an 
obstruction free bank for wildlife.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 6, 7 & 8.
7.18 Watercourses are vital to biodiversity, provide a unique range of habitats, act 
as wildlife corridors, and form an important element of South Oxfordshire’s 
ecological network. They make a significant contribution towards the character 
of our landscape and form an important part of Green Infrastructure. They 
provide vital ecosystem services, help improve water quality, provide drainage 
and flood management and provide green space for informal recreation. Of 
specific note are South Oxfordshire’s globally rare chalk streams which support 
special wildlife habitats and species.
7.19 The health of all watercourses is under pressure from a variety of issues 
including abstraction, pollution and increased disturbance. It is essential that 
watercourses are positively integrated into the design of new development 
from the outset to protect their ecological importance and retain and enhance 
biodiversity. Integrating watercourses into development can provide attractive 
riverside settings, natural areas of Green Infrastructure and areas for informal 
recreation.
7.20 All development proposals adjacent to watercourses should avoid damaging 
impacts and provide mitigation for any unavoidable impacts. Development 
proposals should aim to provide enhancements to the watercourse that benefit 
biodiversity and other ecosystem services.
Watercourse Buffer Zones
7.21 Watercourse buffer zones are required to avoid disturbance associated with 
development. The buffer zone should be a minimum of 10 metres wide, Development 
proposals should 
aim to provide 
enhancements to 
the watercourse 
that benefit 
biodiversity and 
other ecosystem 
services172
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020measured from the top of each bank. Larger developments should provide 
further buffering which can be used for informal recreation.
7.22 Buffer zones:
i) Allow the watercourse to undergo the natural processes of erosion, 
deposition and natural changes to the bank profile without necessitating 
intrusive and harmful bank protection works
ii) Provide space for semi-aquatic and terrestrial habitats which are important 
to the lifecycle of many species
iii) Create, maintain and enhance wildlife corridors which can also be used as 
part of Green Infrastructure networks
iv) Prevent permanent overshadowing of the water by buildings
v) Reduce the risk of pollution caused by run-off
vi) Reduce incidences of flooding by allowing water storage and the natural 
drainage of rainwater.
7.23 Proposals should include long term management plans for the buffer zone 
which retain and enhance its biodiversity value and should seek to reinstate 
buffer zones where previous land uses or development have not provided this. 
Buffer zones should be reserved as a natural or semi-natural habitat, free from 
built development and formal landscaping, planted with native species that 
are naturally found by local riversides. Soft infrastructure such as pedestrian 
footpaths should be kept to a minimum. The buffer zone should not form 
domestic land or parking areas of any kind, but may form part of the requisite 
Green Infrastructure for new developments.
7.24 Where a 10 metre wide buffer zone is not considered possible by the Council, 
proposals should be accompanied by detailed plans to show how the land 
will be managed to promote biodiversity and how maintenance access to the 
watercourse will be created.
7.25 It should be noted that in addition to any planning permission, consent is 
required from either the Environment Agency or the Lead Local Flood Authority 
to carry out any work within 8 metres of a watercourse.
Culverts
7.26 Culverting can have a huge impact on the ecology of the watercourse by 
removing habitat and fragmenting the channel and its river corridor. All 
opportunities to de-culvert a watercourse should be taken. Culverting should 
be avoided as:
i) the absence of sunlight, natural banks and vegetation means that culverts 
are not usually able to sustain significant life;The buffer zone 
should not 
form domestic 
land or parking 
areas of any 
kind, but may 
form part of the 
requisite Green 
Infrastructure 
for new 
developmentsSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020173
ii) they are often protected by screens, which usually makes the culvert 
impenetrable to animals such as otters, water voles, fish and invertebrates. 
This can prevent the movement of species along the river corridor and lead 
to animals being forced onto roads causing animal deaths and road traffic 
incidents;
iii) they can significantly increase the risk of flooding due to the risk of 
blockage and changed channel dynamics; and
iv) maintenance is complicated due to restricted access.
Green Infrastructure
Policy ENV5: Green Infrastructure in New Developments
1. Development will be expected to contribute towards the provision of 
additional Green Infrastructure and protect or enhance existing Green 
Infrastructure. 
2. Proposals should:
i) protect,   conserve or enhance the district’s Green Infrastructure;
ii) provide an appropriate level of Green Infrastructure with 
regard to requirements set out in the Green Infrastructure 
Strategy,   AONB Management Plan or the Habitats Regulations 
Assessment;
iii) avoid the loss,   fragmentation,   severance or other negative 
impact on the function of Green Infrastructure;
iv) provide appropriate mitigation where there would be an 
adverse impact on Green Infrastructure; and
v) provide an appropriate replacement where it is necessary for 
development to take place on areas of Green Infrastructure.
3. All Green Infrastructure provision should be designed with regard 
to the quality standards set out within the Green Infrastructure 
Strategy,   or where relevant the Didcot Garden Town Delivery 
Plan. Consideration should also be given to inclusive access and 
contributing to gains in biodiversity,   particularly through the use 
of appropriate planting which takes account of changing weather 
patterns. Where new Green Infrastructure is provided,   applicants 
should ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure 
its ongoing management and maintenance.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 6, 7 & 8.174
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
7.27 Green Infrastructure is a network of multi-functional green space in both urban 
and rural areas, which is capable of delivering a wide range of environmental 
and quality of life benefits for local communities. Such networks can also 
include “blue” infrastructure features such as ponds, lakes, reservoirs, streams 
and rivers. When assessing planning applications, we will take into account 
the findings of the Green Infrastructure Strategy and the Habitat Regulations 
Assessment (HRA) to define new Green Infrastructure requirements and how 
they should be delivered. Where new Green Infrastructure is identified as a 
mitigation requirement within the HRA this must be delivered by the applicant 
to meet requirements. Green Infrastructure can have an important role to play 
in enhancing biodiversity, acting as a carbon store, and enhancing the quality 
of life for residents. Applicants should refer to guides such as the Fieldfare 
Trust ‘Countryside for All – A Good Practice Guide to Disabled People’s Access 
in the Countryside’ and the South Oxfordshire Design Guide to ensure that the 
positive contributions of Green Infrastructure are maximised.
.
Historic Environment and 
Heritage Assets
Policy ENV6: Historic Environment
1. Proposals for new development that may affect designated and non-
designated heritage assets should take account of the desirability of 
sustaining and enhancing the significance of those assets and putting 
them to viable uses consistent with their conservation. Heritage assets 
include statutorily designated Scheduled Monuments,   Listed Buildings 
or structures,   Conservation Areas,   Registered Parks and Gardens,  
Registered Battlefields,   archaeology of national and local interest 
and non-designated buildings,   structures or historic landscapes that 
contribute to local historic and architectural interest of the district’s 
historic environment,   and also includes those heritage assets listed by 
the Oxfordshire Historic Environmental Record. 
2. Proposals for new development should be sensitively designed and 
should not cause harm to the historic environment. Proposals that 
have an impact on heritage assets (designated and non-designated) 
will be supported particularly where they:
i) conserve or enhance the significance of the heritage asset and 
settings. The more important the heritage asset,   the greater the South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020175
weight that will be given to its conservation;
ii) make a positive contribution to local character and 
distinctiveness (through high standards of design,   reflecting its 
significance,   including through the use of appropriate materials 
and construction techniques);
iii) make a positive contribution towards wider public benefits;
iv) provide a viable future use for a heritage asset that is consistent 
with the conservation of its significance; and/or
v) protect a heritage asset that is currently at risk.
3. Non-designated heritage assets,   where identified through local or 
neighbourhood plan-making,   Conservation Area Appraisal or review 
or through the planning application process,   will be recognised as 
heritage assets in accordance with national guidance and any local 
criteria. Development proposals that directly or indirectly affect the 
significance of a non-designated heritage asset will be determined 
with regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the 
asset.
4. Applicants will be required to describe,   in line with best practice and 
relevant national guidance,   the significance of any heritage assets 
affected including any contribution made by their setting. The level 
of detail should be proportionate to the asset’s importance. In some 
circumstances further survey,   analysis and/or recording will be made a 
condition of consent. 
5. Particular encouragement will be given to schemes that will help 
secure the long term conservation of vacant and under-used buildings 
and bring them back into appropriate use.
6. Alterations to historic buildings,   for example to improve energy 
efficiency,   should respect the integrity of the historic environment and 
the character and significance of the building. 
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5, 6 & 7
7.28  Heritage assets may be classified as either ‘designated’ or ‘non-designated’ 
and both can be important to consider through the planning process. Heritage 
assets can include Listed Buildings, Scheduled Monuments, Conservation 
Areas, Registered Parks and Gardens, archaeological sites and other assets.176
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
7.29 Development proposals at an early stage should refer to sources of information 
on the historic environment such as the Oxfordshire Historic Landscape 
Characterisation Project, The Oxfordshire Historic Environment Record, The 
National Heritage List for England, the South Oxfordshire Heritage Impact 
Assessment, and, where relevant, Conservation Area Character Appraisals to 
ensure that proposals are based on an understanding of the significance of any 
heritage assets that may be affected. Development proposals should also take 
into account the principles set out in the South Oxfordshire Design Guide and 
other relevant guidance. 
7.30 In some circumstances, further surveys and analysis may be required prior 
to any application being determined. Heritage Statements, Statements of 
Significance, and Impact Assessments should be produced in line with current 
best practice and relevant national guidance.
7.31 The Council will monitor buildings or other heritage assets at risk through 
neglect, decay or other threats, proactively seeking solutions for assets at 
risk through discussions with owners and willingness to consider positively 
development schemes that would ensure the repair and maintenance of the 
asset, and, as a last resort, using its statutory powers. The Council will work 
with relevant stakeholders to encourage better understanding of the heritage 
assets on the Historic England “Heritage at Risk” Register. Where appropriate 
the Council will encourage Heritage Partnership Agreements, particularly for 
Listed Buildings on any ‘at risk’ register.
7.32 The Council will support Neighbourhood Development Plans where they seek to 
assess their heritage assets and add to the evidence base.
Listed Buildings
Policy ENV7: Listed Buildings
1. Proposals for development,   including change of use,   that involve any 
alteration of,   addition to or partial demolition of a listed building or 
within the curtilage of,   or affecting the setting of a listed building will 
be expected to:
i)  conserve,   enhance or better reveal those elements which 
contribute to the heritage significance and/or its setting;
ii) respect any features of special architectural or historic interest,  
including,   where relevant,   the historic curtilage or context,   such 
as burgage plots,   or its value within a group and/or its setting,  South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020177
such as the importance of a street frontage or traditional 
shopfronts; and
iii) be sympathetic to the listed building and its setting in terms of 
its siting,   size,   scale,   height,   alignment,   materials and finishes 
(including colour and texture),   design and form,   in order to 
retain the special interest that justifies its designation through 
appropriate design,   with regard to the South Oxfordshire Design 
Guide.
2. Development proposals affecting the significance of a listed building 
or its setting that will lead to substantial harm or total loss of 
significance will be refused unless it can be demonstrated that the 
substantial harm or loss is necessary to achieve substantial public 
benefits that demonstrably outweigh that harm or loss or where the 
applicant can demonstrate that:
i) the nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of 
the site; and
ii) no viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the 
medium term through appropriate marketing that will enable its 
conservation; and
iii) conservation by grant-funding or some form of not for profit,  
charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and
iv) the harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the 
site back into use.
3. Development proposals that would result in less than substantial 
harm to the significance of a listed building will be expected to:
i) minimise harm and avoid adverse impacts,   and provide 
justification for any adverse impacts,   harm or loss of significance;
ii) identify any demonstrable public benefits or exceptional 
circumstances in relation to the development proposed; and
iii) investigate and record changes or loss of fabric,   features,   
objects or remains,   both known and unknown,   in a manner 
proportionate to the importance of the change or loss,   and to 
make this information publicly accessible.
4. Changes of use will be supported where it can be demonstrated that 
the new use can be accommodated without any adverse effect on the 
significance of the building and its setting.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5 & 7.178
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 20207.33  A “Listed Building” is a building, object or structure fixed to the building or 
within the building’s curtilage that has been judged to be of national importance 
in terms of architectural or historic interest and included on a special register, 
called the List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest. 
7.34 When a building is listed, it is listed in its entirety, which means that both the 
exterior and the interior are protected which includes interior features and 
fabric such as staircases, panelling, roof structures, floors, walls, fireplaces, 
doors etc. In addition, any object or structure fixed to the building, and any 
object or structure within the curtilage of the building, which although not 
fixed to the building, forms part of the land and has done so since before 1 
July 1948, are treated as being part of the listed building.
7.35 Many listed buildings, due to their age and construction, have features which 
could support roosting bats. To ensure compliance with relevant legislation, 
species survey information will be required, and ecological conditions applied 
to consents granted, in instances where proposed works to listed buildings 
would be reasonably likely to impact roosting bats.
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020179
Conservation Areas
Policy ENV8: Conservation Areas
1. Proposals for development within or affecting the setting of a 
Conservation Area must conserve or enhance its special interest,  
character,   setting and appearance. Development will be expected to:
i) contribute to the Conservation Area’s special interest and its 
relationship within its setting. The special characteristics of 
the Conservation Area (such as existing walls,   buildings,   trees,  
hedges,   burgage plots,   traditional shopfronts and signs,   farm 
groups,   medieval townscapes,   archaeological features,   historic 
routes etc.) should be preserved;
ii) take into account important views within,   into or out of the 
Conservation Area and show that these would be retained and 
unharmed;
iii) respect the local character and distinctiveness of the 
Conservation Area in terms of the development’s: siting; size; 
scale; height; alignment; materials and finishes (including colour 
and texture); proportions; design; and form and should have 
regard to the South Oxfordshire Design Guide and any relevant 
Conservation Area Character Appraisal;
iv) be sympathetic to the original curtilage of buildings and pattern 
of development that forms part of the historic interest of the 
Conservation Area;
v) be sympathetic to important spaces such as paddocks,   greens,  
gardens and other gaps or spaces between buildings which 
make a positive contribution to the pattern of development in 
the Conservation Area;
vi) ensure the wider social and environmental effects generated by 
the development are compatible with the existing character and 
appearance of the Conservation Area; and/or
vii) ensure no loss of,   or harm to any building or feature that makes 
a positive contribution to the special interest,   character or 
appearance of the Conservation Area.
2. Where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to or 
total loss of significance of a Conservation Area,   consent will only be 
granted where it can be demonstrated that the substantial harm is 
necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh that 
harm or loss.180
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
3. Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm 
to the significance of a Conservation Area,   this harm will be weighed 
against the public benefits of the proposal.
4. Wherever possible the sympathetic restoration and re-use of 
structures which make a positive contribution to the special interest,  
character or appearance of the Conservation Area will be encouraged 
to prevent harm through the cumulative loss of features which are an 
asset to the Conservation Area.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5 & 7.
7.36 Conservation Areas are described in Section 69 of the Planning (Listed 
Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as “areas of special architectural 
or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to 
preserve or enhance”. Inevitably, these areas will vary greatly. Pleasant groups 
of buildings, open spaces, trees, an historic settlement pattern, a village 
green, or features of archaeological interest, may all contribute to the special 
character of an area, and it is that character, rather than individual buildings, 
which Conservation Area legislation seeks to preserve and enhance.
7.37 A feature of many towns are ‘burgage plots’. Surviving patterns of burgage 
plots have considerable historic and archaeological significance and contribute 
much to the character of Henley-on-Thames, Thame and Wallingford. They are 
among the principal historic assets of these towns and should be conserved.
7.38 When undertaking Conservation Area Appraisals the opportunity will be taken 
to produce and update lists of locally important non-designated heritage assets 
and identification of any heritage assets ‘at risk’ in order to encourage better 
understanding.
Archaeology
Policy ENV9: Archaeology and Scheduled Monuments
1. Development must protect the site and setting of Scheduled 
Monuments or nationally important designated or undesignated 
archaeological remains.
2. Applicants will be expected to undertake an assessment of 
appropriate detail to determine whether the development site is South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020181
known to,   or is likely to,   contain archaeological remains. Proposals 
must show the development proposals have had regard to any such 
remains.
3. Where the assessment indicates archaeological remains on site,   and 
development could disturb or adversely affect archaeological remains 
and/or their setting,   applicants will be expected to:
i) submit an appropriate archaeological desk-based assessment; or
ii) undertake a field evaluation (conducted by a suitably qualified 
archaeological organisation),   where necessary.
4. Nationally important archaeological remains (whether scheduled 
or demonstrably of equivalent significance) should be preserved in 
situ. Non-designated archaeological sites or deposits of significance 
equal to that of a nationally important monument will be assessed as 
though those sites or deposits are designated.
5. Where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to 
or total loss of significance of such remains consent will only be 
permitted where it can be demonstrated that the substantial harm or 
loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh 
that harm or loss.
6. Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm 
to the significance of such remains,   this harm will be weighed against 
the public benefits of the proposal.
7. For other archaeological remains,   the effect of a development 
proposal on the significance of the remains,   either directly or indirectly,  
will be taken into account in determining the application.
8. In exceptional cases,   where harm to or loss of significance to the 
asset is considered to be justified,   the harm should be minimised,   and 
mitigated by a programme of archaeological investigation,   including 
excavation,   recording and analysis. Planning permission will not be 
granted until this programme has been submitted to,   and approved 
by,   the Council and development should not commence until these 
works have been satisfactorily undertaken by an appropriately 
qualified organisation. The results and analysis of findings subsequent 
to the investigation should be published and made available to the 
relevant local and county authorities.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5 & 7.182
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
7.39 Our archaeological resource has great social, economic, cultural and educational 
value for the community and this potential can be developed through suitable 
management and interpretation. Some archaeological sites and monuments are 
designated as Scheduled Monuments and are legally protected under the terms 
of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act.
7.40 A network of historic routes also exist as archaeological features in the district, 
ranging from pre-historic tracks, Roman roads, medieval coffin ways, salt roads, 
and droveways, to later turnpike roads. These routes are integrated into the 
district’s landscape and serve an important function in linking settlements and 
forming a unique setting for the district’s distinctive landscape features and will 
therefore be protected.
Historic Battlefields, Registered Parks and Gardens and 
Historic Landscapes
Policy ENV10: Historic Battlefields, Registered Parks and 
Gardens and Historic Landscapes
1. Proposals should conserve or enhance the special historic interest,  
character or setting of a battlefield,   or park or garden on the Historic 
England Registers of Historic Battlefields or Register of Historic Parks 
and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England.
2. Any harm to or loss of significance of any heritage asset requires 
clear and convincing justification. Substantial harm to or loss of these 
assets should be wholly exceptional in the case of Registered Historic 
Battlefields and Grade I and Grade II* Registered Historic Parks and 
Gardens and exceptional in the case of Grade II Registered Historic 
Parks and Gardens.
3. Where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to or 
total loss of significance of a designated heritage asset,   consent will 
only be granted where it can be demonstrated that the substantial 
harm or loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that 
outweigh that harm or loss. All other options for their conservation or 
use must have been explored. 
4. A balanced judgment,   having regard to the scale of any harm or loss 
and the significance of the heritage asset,   will be required in assessing 
proposals affecting non-designated historic battlefields,   parks and 
historic landscapes including historic routes.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020183
5. Applicants will be required to describe,   in line with best practice and 
relevant national guidance,   the significance of any heritage assets 
affected including any contribution made by their setting. The level 
of detail should be proportionate to the asset’s importance. In some 
circumstances,   further survey,   analysis and recording will be made a 
condition of consent.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5 & 7.
7.41 Historic battlefields, landscapes, parks and gardens are an important part of the 
district’s heritage and environment. They comprise a variety of features including 
the open space itself, views in and out, archaeological remains and, in the 
case of parks or gardens, a conscious design incorporating planting and water 
features, and frequently buildings. The Green Infrastructure and biodiversity 
value of historic landscapes is also important. There is a need to protect such 
sites and their settings and to encourage sympathetic management wherever 
possible.
7.42 A number of the most important sites have been included on the “Historic 
England Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in 
England”. Registered Parks and Gardens are included on the National Heritage 
List for England. Registered sites are of national importance, but the district has 
several other sites of regional or local importance that should also be protected 
from harm, and enhanced where possible.
Environmental Protection and 
Pollution
Policy ENV11: Pollution - Impact from Existing and/
or Previous Land Uses on New Development (Potential 
Receptors of Pollution)
1. Development proposals should be appropriate to their location 
and should be designed to ensure that the occupiers of a new 
development will not be subject to individual and/or cumulative 
adverse effect(s) of pollution. Proposals will need to avoid or provide 
details of proposed mitigation methods to protect occupiers of a new 
development from the adverse impact(s) of pollution.184
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
2. Unless there is a realistic potential for appropriate mitigation,  
development will not be permitted if it is likely to be adversely 
affected by pollution. Factors can include,   but are not limited to:
• noise or vibration;
• smell,   dust,   odour,   artificial light,   gases and other emissions;
• air pollution,   contamination of the site or its surroundings and 
hazardous substances nearby;
• land instability; and
• any other relevant types of pollution.
3. Opportunities to mitigate and/or remediate the impacts of pollution 
on the natural environment should also be considered wherever 
possible and related to a development.
4. Development on contaminated land will not be permitted unless 
the contamination is effectively treated by the developer to prevent 
any harm to human health and the natural environment (including 
controlled waters).
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 6, 7 & 8.
Policy ENV12: Pollution - Impact of Development on 
Human Health, the Natural Environment and/or Local 
Amenity (Potential Sources of Pollution)
1. Development proposals should be located in sustainable locations and 
should be designed to ensure that they will not result in significant 
adverse impacts on human health,   the natural environment and/or 
the amenity of neighbouring uses.
2. The individual and cumulative impacts of development on human 
health,   the natural environment and/or local amenity will be 
considered when assessing development proposals.
3. The consideration of the merits of development proposals will be 
balanced against the adverse impact on human health,   the natural 
environment and/or local amenity,   including the following factors:
• noise or vibration;
• smell,   dust,   odour,   artificial light,   gases and other emissions;
• air pollution,   contamination of the site or its surroundings and 
hazardous substances nearby;South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020185
• land instability; and
• any other relevant types of pollution.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 6, 7 & 8.
7.43 “Pollution” is anything that affects the quality of land, air, water or soils, which 
might lead to an adverse impact on human health, the natural environment or 
general amenity. Pollution can arise from a range of emissions, including smoke, 
fumes, gases, dust, steam, odour, noise and light. Pollution can also include 
legacy contamination of soils and groundwater, ground conditions and land 
instability, natural hazards or sources of pollution from former activities such as 
mining.
7.44 In determining planning applications, the Council will consider whether 
the proposal is an acceptable use of the land, the cumulative impact of the 
proposal and also consider the impact of the proposed use. Amongst other 
matters, the Council will consider proposals in terms of how it may be affected 
by sources of pollution and how a proposal may cause pollution. The Council 
will prevent new development from being put at risk from or being adversely 
affected by, unacceptable levels of pollution or land instability. Development 
should be appropriate for its location. The Council will also consider the future 
remediation of the land.
7.45 Where a site is affected by contamination or land stability issues, responsibility 
for securing a safe development rests with the developer and/or landowner. 
Proposals should avoid or provide assessments of and mitigation for 
all significant adverse impacts from pollution. Further information on 
requirements and standards is available from the Council’s Environmental 
Protection Team.
7.46 The Council will also consider that existing businesses and uses may wish to 
develop in continuance and will therefore consider the effect nearby proposals 
may have on these existing businesses and uses.
7.47 The Council will consider proposals against current local and national 
standards, guidance, legislation and/or objectives. This will include 
consideration of the presence of Air Quality Management Areas and the 
cumulative impacts on air quality. There are currently three Air Quality 
Management Areas within South Oxfordshire at Henley-on-Thames, 
Wallingford and Watlington. The adjoining urban areas of Oxford City and 
Reading town centre, and the town centre of Abingdon-on-Thames are also 
designated Air Quality Management Areas.186
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Policy EP1: Air Quality
1. In order to protect public health from the impacts of poor air quality:
i)  development must have regard to the measures laid out in the 
Council’s Developer Guidance Document and the associated Air 
Quality Action Plan,   as well as the national air quality guidance 
and any Local Transport Plans;
ii)  where sensitive development is proposed in areas of existing 
poor air quality and/or where significant development is 
proposed,   an Air Quality Assessment will be required;
iii)  all development proposals should include measures to minimise 
air pollution at the design stage and incorporate best practice in 
the design,   construction and operation of the development;
iv) where a development has a negative impact on air quality,  
including cumulative impact,   developers should identify 
mitigation measures that will sufficiently minimise emissions 
from the development. Where mitigation is not sufficient the 
impacts should be offset through planning obligations; and
v) development will only be permitted where it does not exceed 
air pollution levels set by European and UK regulations.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 6, 7 & 8.
Hazardous Substances
Policy EP2: Hazardous Substances
1. Development which involves the use,   movement or storage of 
hazardous substances will only be permitted where a suitable and 
sufficient risk assessment has been carried out and identified control 
measures implemented to adequately reduce risk as far as reasonably 
practical to the health and safety of users of the site,   neighbouring 
land and the environment. Development within the vicinity of an 
installation involving hazardous substances or activities will only 
be permitted if the impact on health and safety of occupants of 
that development is acceptable. The Council will seek to reduce the 
potential for conflicting land uses and promote safety of people and 
protection of the environment.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 6 & 7. South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020187
7.48 The Council is empowered under the Planning (Hazardous Substances) Act 
1990 to regulate the presence of hazardous substances, so that they cannot be 
kept or used above specified quantities. National Planning Practice Guidance 
provides further advice on how the planning system deals with hazardous 
substances. Development of new installations where hazardous substances are 
handled will be carefully controlled.
Waste Collection and Recycling
Policy EP3: Waste Collection and Recycling 
1. Development proposals for residential use must ensure:
i) adequate facilities are provided for the sorting,   storage and 
collection of waste and recycling;
ii) sufficient space is provided for the storage and collection of 
individual or communal recycling and refuse containers; and
iii) access is provided that is safe for existing users/residents and for 
refuse and recycling collection vehicles.
2. Development proposals for non-residential use must ensure:
i) sufficient space is provided for the storage of communal 
recycling and refuse containers; and
ii) provision is made that is adequate for the proposed use. The 
location and design of recycling and refuse provision should be 
integral to the design of the proposed development.
3. In assessing recycling and refuse provision,   the following points 
should be considered:
i) the level and type of provision,   having regard to the above 
requirements and relevant space standards;
ii) the location of the provision,   having regard to the need to 
provide and maintain safe and convenient access for occupants,  
while also providing satisfactory access for collection vehicles;
iii) the impact of the provision on visual amenity,   having regard to 
the need to minimise the prominence of the facilities and screen 
any external provision;
iv) the impact of the provision on health and amenity of 
neighbouring development and the proposed development; and
v) the security of the provision against scavenging pests,   vandalism 
and unauthorised use.188
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
4. Recycling and refuse storage should be separate from cycle storage,  
car parking and key circulation areas.
5. Development will not be permitted if recycling and refuse provision 
that meets the above requirements cannot feasibly or practicably be 
provided.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 4 & 8. 
7.49  In promoting good design it is important to ensure that proper provision is 
made for waste and recycling, storage and collection, and that opportunities 
are taken for incorporating re-use and recycling facilities in all new 
developments.
7.50 Policy DES7 encourages developers to make provision for the effective use of 
resources, including minimising waste and making provision for the recycling 
of waste on site.
7.51 In combination with Policy DES7, Policy EP3 requires that adequate facilities for 
the sorting, storage and collection of waste are provided on all new developments 
and seeks to further encourage sustainable waste management initiatives.
7.52 Refuse and recycling storage and collection facilities should be designed 
and provided with regard to the South Oxfordshire Design Guide and South 
Oxfordshire and Vale of White Horse District Council’s Waste Planning 
Guidance which can be found on the Council’s website.
Flood Risk
Policy EP4: Flood Risk
1. The risk and impact of flooding will be minimised through:
i) directing new development to areas with the lowest probability 
of flooding;
ii) ensuring that all new development addresses the effective 
management of all sources of flood risk;
iii) ensuring that development does not increase the risk of flooding 
elsewhere; and
iv) ensuring wider environmental benefits of development in South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020189
relation to flood risk.
2. The suitability of development proposed in Flood Zones will be 
strictly assessed using the ‘Sequential Test’ and where necessary the 
‘Exceptions Test’. A sequential approach should be used at site level.
3. A site-specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) should be provided for all 
development in Flood Zones 2 and 3. In Flood Zone 1 a FRA should 
accompany all proposals involving:
• sites of 1 hectare or more;
• land which has been identified by the Environment Agency as 
having critical drainage problems;
• land identified in the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment as being at 
increased flood risk in future; or
• land that may be subject to other sources of flooding,   where 
development would introduce a more vulnerable use.
4. All development proposals must be assessed against the current 
South Oxfordshire Strategic Flood Risk Assessment or any updates 
and the Oxfordshire Local Flood Risk Management Strategy to address 
locally significant flooding. Appropriate mitigation and management 
measures must be implemented and maintained.
5. All development will be required to provide a Drainage Strategy. 
Development will be expected to incorporate Sustainable Drainage 
Systems and ensure that run-off rates are attenuated to greenfield 
run-off rates. Higher rates would need to be justified and the risks 
quantified. Development should strive to reduce run-off rates for 
existing developed sites.
6. Sustainable Drainage Systems should seek to enhance water quality 
and biodiversity in line with the Water Framework Directive.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5 & 8. 
7.53  Areas of South Oxfordshire are at risk of flooding and the impact of climate 
change is important. Climate change allowances should be taken into 
consideration in Flood Risk Assessments as set out in National Planning Practice 
Guidance. The planning system has an important role to play in minimising 
flooding, the risk of flooding and increasing resilience. Only appropriate 
development should take place in areas at risk from flooding, and development 190
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
should be directed away from areas of the highest risk. A sequential, risk-based 
approach to locating development, referred to as applying the Sequential Test, 
and if necessary, the Exception Test should be applied, taking into account 
climate change.
7.54 The Council will uphold the sequential approach to flood risk. Neighbourhood 
planning groups considering proposed development within areas at risk of 
flooding must apply the Sequential Test to the whole neighbourhood area. If 
necessary, the Exception Test should also be applied. The Environment Agency 
provide bespoke advice where developments in high flood risk areas require a 
site-specific Flood Risk Assessment. Should mitigation be required, the Council 
will expect those measures to be in the application proposals and part of the 
development.
7.55 Where the redevelopment or change of use of a previously developed site in 
Flood Zone 2 or 3 is proposed, opportunities should be taken to:
• reduce vulnerability to flooding by promoting less vulnerable and water 
compatible uses; and
• reduce the built development footprint, thus improving floodplain storage 
and flow paths.
Minerals Safeguarding Areas
Policy EP5: Minerals Safeguarding Areas
1. Minerals are a non-renewable resource,   therefore to safeguard 
future potential extraction,   development will be directed away from 
Minerals Safeguarding Areas.
2. Where development in Minerals Safeguarding Areas cannot be 
avoided,   developers are encouraged to extract minerals prior to 
non-mineral development taking place,   where this is practical and 
environmentally feasible.
This policy contributes towards achieving objective 7. 
7.56  Minerals Safeguarding Areas as identified in Oxfordshire County Council’s 
Minerals and Waste Core Strategy are shown on the Policies Map.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020191192
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020193   BUILT ENVIRONMENT
8.1  Our “built environment” consists of all the man-made aspects of our 
surroundings. It includes not only buildings but the spaces between buildings 
such as parks and gardens, and social spaces such as squares, as well as the 
infrastructure that supports our daily activities such as streets, railways, utility 
networks and flood defences.
8.2 The way we develop our built environment has a direct impact on how 
successful and sustainable places and communities are. In South Oxfordshire 
we want to create places where people want to live, work and visit. Successful 
places allow us to carry out daily activities with ease and offer choice as to how 
to do them. These places should be designed for everyone and built to last.
High Quality Development
8.3 The Government attaches great importance to the design of the built 
environment, which is an important component of sustainable development. 
New development should create a sense of place and enhance the lives of 
those who live, work and visit there.
8.4 We are committed to securing the highest quality of design in new 
development of all types and scales in South Oxfordshire. The South 
Oxfordshire Design Guide (2016) seeks to define high quality development, 
the principles to achieving it and raise the profile of high quality design 
throughout the district. It aims to address specific design issues that we have 
been experiencing within South Oxfordshire. We consider the Design Guide 
to be a vital tool that will help us create successful and sustainable places. 
The value and quality of the Design Guide has been demonstrated by it being 
shortlisted for two national awards. The Design Guide together with the 
policies in this Plan, will ensure that we can deliver our objectives for high 
quality developments.
193
8South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020194
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Policy DES1: Delivering High Quality Development
1. All new development must be of a high quality design that:
i)  uses land efficiently while respecting the existing landscape 
character;
ii)  enhances biodiversity and,   as a minimum,   leads to no net loss of 
habitat;
iii)  incorporates and/or links to a well-defined network of Green 
and Blue Infrastructure;
iv) is sustainable and resilient to climate change;
v)  minimises energy consumption;
vi)  mitigates water run-off and flood risks;
vii)  takes into account landform,   layout,   building orientation,  
massing and landscaping;
viii)  provides a clear and permeable hierarchy of streets,   routes and 
spaces to create safe and convenient ease of movement by all 
users;
ix)  ensures that streets and spaces are well overlooked creating a 
positive relationship between fronts and backs of buildings;
x)  clearly defines public and private spaces;
xi)  provides access to local services and facilities and,   where needed,  
incorporates mixed uses,   facilities and co-locates services as 
appropriate with good access to public transport;
xii)  provides a wide range of house types and tenures;
xiii)  respects the local context working with and complementing the 
scale,   height,   density,   grain,   massing,   type,   and details of the 
surrounding area;
xiv)  secures a high quality public realm that is interesting and 
aesthetically pleasing; and designed to support an active life for 
everyone with well managed and maintained public areas;
xv)  does not differentiate between the design quality of market and 
affordable housing or the adjacent public realm;
xvi)  is designed to take account of possible future development in 
the local area;
xvii)  understands and addresses the needs of all potential users by 
ensuring that buildings and their surroundings can be accessed 
and used by everyone;
xviii) creates safe communities and reduces the likelihood of crime 
and antisocial behaviour as well as the fear of crime itself; and
xix)  ensures a sufficient level of well-integrated and imaginative 
solutions for car and bicycle parking and external storage South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020195
including bins.
2. Where development sites are located adjacent to sites that have a 
reasonable prospect of coming forward in the future,   integration with 
the neighbouring site should form part of the proposal’s design.
3. Where the Council is aware that adjacent or closely related sites with 
similar delivery timescales are coming forward together,   a coordinated,  
integrated and comprehensive masterplan will be required to be 
prepared across all the sites.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5, 7 & 8.
8.5 Creating high quality buildings and places is fundamental. Policy DES1 sets 
out the key design objectives that we consider critical in delivering high 
quality development. These must be considered at the outset and throughout 
the design process. The Council will support development that meets these 
objectives. Developers should also have regard to the principles and design 
criteria set out in the South Oxfordshire Design Guide.  New development 
should take account of all relevant guidance including the Government’s 
priorities for well-designed places set out in the National Design Guide (2019), 
Oxfordshire County Council’s Cycling Design Standards (2017), Walking Design 
Standards (2017) and Residential Road Design Guide 2nd Edition (2015) or 
updated versions of these documents. New development within the Chilterns 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty should meet the principles set out in the 
Chilterns Building Design Guide.
8.6 Securing high quality design is about more than just aesthetics. It is important 
that new development delivers sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities 
in order to create successful places where people want to live, work and play. 
New development should be designed to meet the needs of all users including 
the young and elderly, disabled, parents and carers. It is important that the 
places that we create are safe. To ensure that the development we deliver is 
designed to reduce the opportunity for crime, as well as the fear of crime itself, 
proposals must, wherever possible, incorporate the principles set out in the 
“Secured by Design” scheme.
8.7 The quality of the spaces between buildings is as important as the buildings 
themselves. They are the setting for most movement and should be designed 
to support an active life for everyone. These should include areas allocated to 
different users for different purposes, including movement, parking, hard and 
soft surfaces, street furniture, lighting, signage and public art.196
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
8.8 In the right locations, public art can play an important part in the design and 
place making of new developments and can make a contribution to the creation 
of a high quality public realm. It can make places more interesting, exciting and 
aesthetically pleasing. The Council will support the provision of public art within 
new development schemes in accordance with the Arts Development Strategy. 
The Council will encourage and promote quality art within new developments by 
encouraging partnership working between professional artists and craftspeople 
and encouraging local participation to help establish an identity for an area. 
The Council will particularly support proposals that use public art to make a 
positive contribution to the character of an area and that is of benefit to the local 
community by establishing civic or corporate pride and identity, encouraging 
public enjoyment and engagement and/or promoting the renewal of social skills.
8.9 Past developments in the district have not always taken account of future 
development coming forward on adjacent sites, this has undermined the 
integration of new development with existing communities.
Policy DES2: Enhancing Local Character 
1. All new development must be designed to reflect the positive 
features that make up the character of the local area and should both 
physically and visually enhance and complement the surroundings.
2. All proposals for new development should be informed by a 
contextual analysis that demonstrates how the design: 
i) has been informed by and responds positively to the site and its 
surroundings; and
ii) reinforces place-identity by enhancing local character.
3. Where a Character Assessment has been prepared as part of a made 
Neighbourhood Development Plan,   a proposal must demonstrate 
that the positive features identified in the Assessment have been 
incorporated into the design of the development.
4. Where there is no local Character Assessment a comprehensive 
contextual analysis of the local character should be prepared as part 
of an application. This should identify the positive features that make 
up the character of the area. The proposal must demonstrate that 
these positive features have been incorporated into the design of the 
development.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020197
5. Proposals that have the potential to impact upon a Conservation Area 
or the setting of a Conservation Area should also take account of the 
relevant Conservation Character Appraisal.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5 & 7.
8.10 All proposals should take account of the local context, including the local 
character and existing features. Important local features, both within the 
landscape and built environment, in particular should be retained as part of the 
proposal. This should be set out on an opportunities and constraints plan. 
8.11  National planning guidance emphasises the importance of promoting 
and reinforcing local distinctiveness as well as being positive about good 
contemporary design. Proposals for new development should demonstrate 
how they reflect the special character of South Oxfordshire as well as the 
distinct character of the local area. This should be set out in the Design and 
Access Statement that supports the application. 
8.12  The Council encourages communities preparing Neighbourhood Development 
Plans to consider what the positive features are in their local area and 
identify them as part of a made Plan. Where these local features have been 
identified as part of a made Neighbourhood Development Plan, proposals 
should demonstrate that they have been incorporated into the design. Where 
these local features have not been identified, proposals should include a 
comprehensive contextual analysis that identifies them.
8.13  In some cases developers have been selective in the features that they 
have identified as forming part of the local character and have not always 
considered whether the features form a positive part of the local character. 
To avoid developments reflecting previous poor quality design the Council 
may undertake its own contextual analysis if it is considered that the positive 
features of the local character have not been identified correctly.To avoid

South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
Policy DES3: Design and Access Statements
1. Where an application is required to be supported by a Design and 
Access Statement,   this must demonstrate how the development 
proposal meets the design objectives and principles set out in the 
South Oxfordshire Design Guide. 
2. The Design and Access Statement should be proportional to the scale 
and complexity of the proposal. It should include:
i) a clear drawing trail that shows how the design of the proposal  
and the rationale behind it has evolved and clearly demonstrates 
that the design objectives and principles set out in the South 
Oxfordshire Design Guide have been considered at the outset 
and throughout the process and have been met by the final 
design;
ii) a constraints and opportunities plan that clearly informs the 
design process and final design;
iii) the delivery implementation phases and strategies to be put in 
place to ensure the timely delivery of infrastructure and services 
when they are needed by new residents; and
iv) how consultation with the existing community and communities 
in the surrounding area has informed the design of the 
development.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5 & 7.
8.14 Design and Access Statements are an important mechanism for communicating 
the design of a development. A checklist setting out when a Design and Access 
statement is required as part of a planning application can be found on the 
Council’s website.
Policy DES4: Masterplans for Allocated Sites and Major 
Development
1. Proposals for sites allocated in the Development Plan,   including sites 
allocated within Neighbourhood Development Plans,   and major 
development* must be accompanied by a masterplan. For outline 
applications,   an illustrative masterplan should be submitted. In all 
cases,   the masterplan should:South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020199
i) clearly set out the land uses proposed including the amount,  
scale and density of development,   the movement and access 
arrangements and Green Infrastructure provision;
ii) illustrate how the proposal integrates with the surrounding 
built,   historic and natural environments,   in particular maximising 
existing and potential movement connections and accessibility 
to prioritise walking,   cycling and use of public transport;
iii) be based on a full understanding of the significance or special 
interest of the historic environment as it relates to the site,  
including above and below ground archaeological remains and 
other heritage assets on the site or within the setting of which 
the site lies,   and the conservation and enhancement of those 
remains or assets and significance or special interest;
iv) define a hierarchy of routes and the integration of suitable 
infrastructure,   including for example SuDS within the public 
realm;
v) demonstrate a legible structure and identify key elements of 
townscape such as main frontages,   edges,   landmark buildings,  
key building groups and character areas;
vi) be based on the principles of natural surveillance and active 
street frontages by demonstrating that streets and spaces are 
well overlooked and fronted by the main entrances of buildings 
which provide direct access to the street or space and that 
positive relationships have been created between the fronts and 
backs of buildings;
vii) demonstrate as appropriate the careful siting of community 
facilities and other amenities to meet the needs of the existing 
and future community,   including access to education/training 
facilities,   health care,   community leisure and recreation facilities;
viii) demonstrates a clear link to the principles established in the 
Design and Access Statement and the South Oxfordshire Design 
Guide; and
ix) demonstrate that it has been prepared with the involvement of 
the local community and other stakeholders and in consultation 
with the local planning authority.
 *As defined by the Development Management Procedure Order 2010.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.200
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
8.15  Masterplans are an important tool used by designers to set out the strategy 
for a new development and to demonstrate that the general layout, scale and 
other aspects of the design are based on good urban design principles. The 
South Oxfordshire Design Guide sets out the principles of good design that 
must be demonstrated through the preparation of a masterplan as part of 
applications for major development and development of allocated sites.
8.16 Masterplans should be produced in consultation with South Oxfordshire District 
Council, the community and other stakeholders. As part of the masterplanning 
process site promoters and developers should also, where appropriate, explore 
the possibility of long-term stewardship of assets with the local community.
Policy DES5: Outdoor Amenity Space
1. A private outdoor garden or outdoor amenity space,   or alternatively 
a shared outdoor amenity area should be provided for all new 
dwellings. The amount of land that should be provided for the garden 
or amenity space will be determined by the size of the dwelling 
proposed and by the character of surrounding development. Private 
outdoor sitting areas should not be overlooked by adjacent habitable 
rooms. They should also not be compromised by shading from 
buildings or shading,   leaf litter and anxiety of established significant 
trees and hedges that would lead to future pressure to prune or 
remove these landscape features.
2. Proposals for new development should demonstrate that the size,  
location and character of gardens and outdoor amenity spaces have 
been considered as an integral part of the design and not as an 
afterthought. These spaces should not be compromised by parking 
areas or garages.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 4, 5, 6 & 7.
8.17 The relationship of a building with its plot is critical to how well it fits in with 
neighbouring development and to its impact on the overall character of the 
street. The extent of plot coverage also determines the external area available 
for private garden space. This policy and the Design Guide seek to ensure 
that reasonable standards of private amenity space are provided in new 
developments.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020201
8.18 The Design Guide contains guidelines in respect of the recommended 
minimum size of private amenity space that should be provided, with the size 
relating to the number of bedrooms in the proposed dwelling. Used on their 
own, these standards would lead to uniform plot sizes and shapes that pay 
little regard to the character of the area. This policy, however, requires the 
character of the site and the surrounding development to be considered in 
determining the appropriate garden area, as well as the type of dwelling that 
is being provided. It also requires that private garden and outdoor sitting areas 
are designed to provide a reasonable degree of privacy, sunlight and outlook.
8.19 Often garden and outdoor amenity spaces, particularly communal areas provided 
for flatted developments, are identified at the end of the design process and 
consist of the leftover space surrounding the building(s). This tends to result in 
spaces of an inappropriate size and shape that bear no relation to the internal 
workings of the building and/or the requirements of the intended user(s). 
Gardens and outdoor amenity spaces should be considered from the beginning 
of the design process and throughout. The provision of garden and outdoor 
amenity spaces should not be compromised by the need for parking or garages.
Policy DES6: Residential Amenity
1. Development proposals should demonstrate that they will not result 
in significant adverse impacts on the amenity of neighbouring uses,  
when considering both individual and cumulative impacts,   in relation 
to the following factors:
i) loss of privacy,   daylight or sunlight;
ii) dominance or visual intrusion;
iii) noise or vibration;
iv) smell,   dust,   heat,   odour,   gases or other emissions;
v) pollution,   contamination or the use of/or storage of hazardous 
substances; and
vi) external lighting.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5, 6 & 7.
8.20 New dwellings should be designed to ensure adequate privacy for existing and 
new residents to enable them to enjoy their homes without undue intrusion 
from neighbours or the public. Buildings should also be orientated within their 
plots to maximise daylight and passive solar gain, with garden areas orientated to 
maximise sunlight. These objectives can be achieved by careful siting of properties, 202
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
by ensuring that there are adequate distances between properties and through 
the erection of screen walls and fencing. Developments should be designed 
to avoid overshadowing of any adjoining dwelling or dwellings, although it is 
recognised that in high density housing schemes overlooking distances may not 
be so readily achievable. Innovative design approaches will therefore be sought 
to provide acceptable standards of privacy. The Design Guide contains detailed 
guidance.
 
Policy DES7: Efficient Use of Resources
1. New development is required to make provision for the effective use 
and protection of natural resources where applicable,   including:
i) the efficient use of land,   with densities in accordance with Policy 
STRAT5 Residential Densities. Proposals which seek to deliver 
higher quality and higher density development which minimises 
land take will be encouraged;
ii) minimising waste and making adequate provision for the 
recycling,   composting and recovery of waste on site using 
recycled and energy efficient materials;
iii) maximising passive solar heating,   lighting,   natural ventilation,  
energy and water efficiency and the re-use of materials;
iv) making efficient use of water,   for example through rainwater 
harvesting and grey water recycling,   and causing no 
deterioration in,   and where possible,   achieving improvements in 
water quality (including groundwater quality);
v) taking account of,   and if located within an AQMA,   is consistent 
with,   the Council’s Air Quality Action Plan;
vi) ensuring that the land is of a suitable quality for development 
and that remediation of contaminated land is undertaken where 
necessary;
vii) avoiding the development of the best and most versatile 
agricultural land,   unless it is demonstrated to be the most 
sustainable choice from reasonable alternatives,   by first using 
areas of poorer quality land in preference to that of a higher 
quality; and
viii) re-using vacant buildings and redeveloping previously developed 
land,   provided the land is not of a high environmental value.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 20202038.21  In South Oxfordshire, the prudent use of natural resources is a key element 
of delivering sustainable development as this contributes to tackling climate 
change. The Council encourages applicants to consider how our existing 
resources can be used effectively and efficiently when planning and designing 
development proposals. Housing density should be optimised in strategic 
allocations and at the towns in the district, unless there are overriding reasons 
concerning townscape, character, landscape, design or infrastructure capacity. 
Special consideration will be given to the prevailing character and appearance 
in Conservation Areas and the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
8.22 National policy requires planning policies to take account of the presence of Air 
Quality Management Areas (AQMA) and the cumulative impacts on air quality 
from individual sites in local areas. There are three Air Quality Management 
Areas designated in South Oxfordshire in the Market Towns of Henley-on- 
Thames and Wallingford, and the Larger Village of Watlington. This Plan 
seeks to ensure that new development in Air Quality Management Areas is 
consistent with our Air Quality Action Plan.
8.23 The Water Framework Directive seeks to protect the quality of water, including 
the aquatic ecology, unique and valuable habitats, drinking water resources 
and bathing water. It requires that there is no deterioration in the status 
of water bodies and that they all achieve good ecological status by 2027. 
The Thames River Basin Management Plan sets out actions to help meet 
this obligation. Policies on Green Infrastructure, biodiversity and promoting 
sustainable design will also assist in achieving this objective by ensuring 
that surface water run-off is appropriately controlled. Aquifers within South 
Oxfordshire support strategically important public drinking water abstractions. 
Policies will seek to ensure that essential water resources are protected from 
derogation and pollution. Where required, references will be made to the 
Environment Agency, Source Protection zone mapping and their guidance - 
The Environment Agency’s approach to Groundwater Protection.

8.24  Oxfordshire County Council is responsible for determining planning 
applications for minerals and waste development and producing the Minerals 
and Waste Local Plan, which will safeguard mineral resources, aggregate rail 
depots, sites for recycled and secondary aggregate supply, other minerals 
infrastructure sites and sites for waste management. These areas are marked 
on the Policies Map. Should the District receive a planning application in any of 
these areas, Oxfordshire County Council will be consulted on the development. 
Applicants are advised to review the Minerals and Waste Local Plan prior to 
making a planning application.
8.25 All development will be expected to use land efficiently, with a density and 
form appropriate to the site and its surroundings, taking into account local 
character and accessibility to services and facilities. 
 
Sustainable Design and Construction
Policy DES8: Promoting Sustainable Design
1. All new development,   including building conversions,   refurbishments 
and extensions,   should seek to minimise the carbon and energy 
impacts of their design and construction. Proposals must demonstrate 
that they are seeking to limit greenhouse emissions through location,  
building orientation,   design,   landscape and planting taking into 
account any nationally adopted standards and in accordance with 
Policies DES10: Carbon Reduction and DES7: Efficient Use of Resources.
2. All new development should be designed to improve resilience to the 
anticipated effects of climate change. Proposals should incorporate 
measures that address issues of adaptation to climate change taking 
account of best practice. These include resilience to increasing 
temperatures and wind speeds,   heavy rainfall and snowfall events 
and the need for water conservation and storage.
3. All new development should be built to last. Proposals must 
demonstrate that they function well and are adaptable to the 
changing requirements of occupants and other circumstances. 
4. The Council will not refuse planning permission for buildings or 
infrastructure of an outstanding or innovative design which promote 
high levels of sustainability or help raise the standard of design,   as 
long as they fit with the overall form and layout of their surroundings. South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020205
5. A sensitive approach will need to be taken to conserve the special 
character of designated and non designated heritage assets in a 
manner appropriate to their significance.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5, 6, 7 & 8.
8.26 Increasing our resilience to the likely impact of climate change and promoting 
a low carbon future is one of the Local Plan’s strategic objectives in response to 
the Climate Change Act (2008) as amended (2019) which mandates a 100% 
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.
8.27 The design and construction of new developments and refurbishments to 
existing buildings can have a significant role in helping to reduce carbon 
emissions, which can be supported by improving the energy efficiency of new 
and existing buildings.
8.28  To improve resilience to the anticipated effects of climate change, the Council 
expects applicants to consider the effects of changing weather patterns and 
design new developments so that they incorporate measures to combat 
these. This could include planting, shading, the orientation and positioning 
of windows and advanced glazing systems to reduce solar heat gain in the 
summer and from lower sun angles in the winter; using cool building materials 
to prevent the penetration of heat and flood resilient building materials; 
increasing natural ventilation; incorporating flood resilient measures such as 
raising floor levels and preventing the infiltration of heavy rain around windows 
and doors. Consideration should also be given to using locally sourced, more 
sustainable building materials and fuel, for example, locally sourced wood.
8.29 The South Oxfordshire Water Cycle Study identified South Oxfordshire as being 
in an area of water stress. In order to address this, Policy INF4: Water Resources 
applies a higher standard for water efficiency.
8.30  The Government has established that through Part L of the Building Regulations, 
emissions allowed from new buildings will be reduced incrementally and that 
“zero carbon” buildings will be required within the plan period. The Housing 
and Planning Act 2016 stipulated that a review of minimum energy performance 
requirements under Building Regulations must be carried out and it is expected 
that current standards will be improved with the introduction of the Future 
Homes Standard. Policy DES10 sets the Council’s policy requirement for carbon 
reduction.The design and

Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Generation
Policy DES9: Renewable and Low Carbon Energy
1. The Council encourages schemes for renewable and low carbon 
energy generation and associated infrastructure at all scales including 
domestic schemes. It also encourages the incorporation of renewable 
and low carbon energy applications within all development. Planning 
applications for renewable and low carbon energy generation will be 
supported,   provided that they do not cause a significantly adverse 
effect to:
i) landscape,   both designated AONB and locally valued,   
biodiversity,   including protected habitats and species and 
Conservation Target Areas;
ii) the historic environment,   both designated and non-designated 
assets,   including development within their settings;
iii) openness of the Green Belt;
iv) the safe movement of traffic and pedestrians; or
v) residential amenity.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.
8.31 The Government has set a target that the net UK carbon account for the year 
2050 is 100% lower than the 1990 baseline35. To help increase the use of 
renewable and low carbon energy the Council will promote the use of energy 
from renewable and low carbon sources, including community-led initiatives, 
and will develop policies to maximise renewable and low carbon energy 
development while ensuring that adverse impacts are addressed satisfactorily, 
including cumulative landscape and visual impacts. The Council will support 
the inclusion of connection readiness for decentralised energy networks and 
the use of decentralised energy sources in development. The Council will 
identify and publish a list of any areas considered suitable for wind energy 
development within the district.
8.32 There are many forms of renewable energy. The most prevalent being wind, 
solar, biomass, geothermal, hydro power and biofuels. The most appropriate 
form of renewable energy for a development will depend on the scale of the 
development and the opportunities and constraints presented by its location.35 Climate Change Act

www.legislation.gov.uk/
ukpga/2008/27/contentsSouth Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020207
Policy DES10: Carbon Reduction
1. Planning permission will only be granted where development 
proposals for:
i) new build residential dwelling houses; or 
ii)  developments including 1,000sqm or more of C2 use (including 
student accommodation); or
iii)  Houses in Multiple Occupation (C4 use or Sui Generis floorspace) 
achieve at least a 40% reduction in carbon emissions compared with 
a code 2013 Building Regulations compliant base case. This reduction 
is to be secured through renewable energy and other low carbon 
technologies and/ or energy efficiency measures. The requirement 
will increase from 31 March 2026 to at least a 50% reduction in carbon 
emissions and again from 31 March 2030 to a 100% reduction in 
carbon emissions (zero carbon). These targets will be reviewed in the 
light of any future legislation and national guidance. 
2.  Non-residential development proposals are required:
i)  to meet the BREEAM excellent standard (or a recognised 
equivalent assessment methodology) 
ii) in addition development proposals of 1,000sqm or more are 
required to achieve at least a 40% reduction in the carbon 
emissions compared with a 2013 Building Regulations compliant 
base case. This reduction is to be secured through renewable 
energy and other low carbon technologies and/ or energy 
efficiency measures. The requirement will increase from 31 
March 2026 to at least a 50% reduction in carbon emissions. 
3.  An Energy Statement will be submitted to demonstrate compliance 
with this policy for all new build residential developments (other than 
householder applications) and new-build non-residential schemes over 
1,000sqm. The Energy Statement will include details as to how the 
policy will be complied with and monitored. 
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 5 & 8.208
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 20208.33 To tackle the causes of climate change and address the commitment of the 
Council to become a carbon neutral district by 2030 it is crucial that planning 
policy limits carbon dioxide emissions from new development by ensuring 
developments use less energy and assess the opportunities for using renewable 
energy technologies. 
8.34 The Council has ambitious aspirations for reducing the district’s carbon 
emissions and recognises that more could be done to reduce emissions with 
regards to construction emissions, unregulated energy and reducing, capturing 
and storing embodied carbon. The Council also recognises that zero carbon 
homes are achievable for many residential developments now.  The Council 
would encourage the delivery of zero carbon homes as soon as possible 
to avoid the need for costly retrofitting and would support development 
permitted by this Plan that exceeds the carbon reduction requirements set. 
The Council would also encourage similar reductions in terms of construction 
emissions and would implore developers to consider a development’s overall 
carbon footprint and opportunities to reduce carbon emissions from the 
construction of infrastructure through offsetting. A request for a departure 
from this policy is expected to be supported by robust evidence including 
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020209viability assessments where required and will only be supported exceptionally. 
The Council will monitor the effect of this policy and consider a review of the 
policy in the light of any future legislation and national policy in this field.
8.35 New build non-residential buildings are required to meet the BREEAM excellent 
standard. This broadly represents performance equivalent to the top 10% 
of UK non-domestic buildings. Other recognised equivalent assessment 
methodology may be used, applicants are advised to check with the Council 
in order to ensure their alternative assessment methodology is acceptable. In 
addition to meeting the BREEAM excellent standard, new build non-residential 
development proposals of 1,000sqm or more, are required to achieve at least a 
40% reduction in carbon emissions, increasing to 50% from 2026. 
8.36 All energy efficiency measures used to achieve a reduction in carbon emissions, 
including renewable energy and low carbon technologies, should be delivered 
on-site, where possible. Where off-site renewable energy and low carbon 
technologies need to be used, the renewable or low carbon energy produced 
should directly service the proposed development scheme.
8.37 The Council encourages developers to take account of the energy hierarchy 
when identifying the measures taken to reduce carbon emissions and to adopt 
a fabric first approach by maximising the performance of the components 
and materials that make up the building fabric before considering the use of 
mechanical or electrical building services systems. Consideration should also be 
given to modern methods of construction.
8.38  It is important that the carbon emissions of these new developments are 
monitored effectively to ensure compliance. The Energy Statement submitted 
to support the application needs to set out how the developer will demonstrate 
compliance with the carbon reduction requirements and how emissions will 
be monitored to ensure that the development continues to comply. Suitable 
accreditations can be used to demonstrate compliance as part of the Energy 
Statement, for example the Passivhaus standard or the highest BREEAM 
standards. However, it will need to be clear how the accreditation relates to 
the requirements of the policy.
8.39 More information regarding sustainable design and construction is set out in 
the Council’s Design Guide.210
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020211ENSURING THE VITALITY 
OF TOWN CENTRES
Introduction
9.1 The NPPF encourages local planning authorities to pursue town centre 
policies which support their vitality and viability. In doing so, local planning 
authorities are expected to recognise that town centres are at the heart of 
their communities and therefore policies to manage and grow them should 
be in place. However, town centres and, in particular the retail sector is facing 
significant challenges, a fact acknowledged and recognised by the Government 
through its removal of the requirement for local planning authorities to identify 
primary and secondary shopping frontages. 
 
9.2 South Oxfordshire District is made up of the largest town; Didcot and the three 
Market Towns of Henley-on-Thames, Thame and Wallingford, numerous large 
and small villages, and local shopping parades providing services to nearby 
settlements. These are areas where people go to access their employment, 
leisure and shopping needs – many have become the heart of their local 
community’s activities. Focusing people’s day to day activities within these 
centres also brings multiple benefits to both businesses as well as local 
communities.
9.3 The district’s town centres are facing increasing competition for expenditure 
from nearby centres outside of the district including Aylesbury, Bicester Village, 
High Wycombe and the higher order services and functions provided by Oxford 
City and Reading. 
9.4 This Plan seeks to build on the district’s improved retail offer and achieve a 
good balance of mixed uses in our town and village centres in order to meet 
the needs of those who live, work, shop and spend leisure time here36. The 
policies in this section provide the Council’s proposed way forward for focusing 
growth, by recognising development already taking place in its town centres, 
particularly within Didcot. Changes to the Use Classes Order in 2020 provide 
enhanced flexibility for the use of buildings to switch between commercial, 
business and service uses in Class E. While all Market Towns also perform a 
leisure function, it is Henley-on-Thames which has a greater dual retail and 
leisure offer.9

 Policy TC1: Retail and Services Growth
1. Provision is made for 26,640sqm37 (net) of comparison retail 
floorspace and 4,500sqm38 of convenience floorspace to be provided in 
the district over the plan period.
2. Provision of convenience floorspace required within the strategic 
allocations will be dealt with in each of the respective STRAT Policies.
This policy contributes towards achieving objective 3.
9.5 The Orchard Centre phase II extension has delivered approximately 15,000sqm 
of additional retail and commercial floorspace to the existing town centre in 
Didcot. The extension, anchored by an M&S food store, enhances Didcot town 
centre’s offer by bringing to it 23 stores, six restaurants, cafes and a gym, as 
well as improved public realm and car parking. 
9.6 The NPPF requires the Council to positively promote competitive town centre 
environments through policy formulation and to at least fully meet the retail 
need, so that the local economy is not constrained and potential investment 
diverted outside the district. The role of the centres set out in the district’s 
town centre hierarchy (Policy TC2) will influence the provision, ensuring that 
it is appropriate and realistic whilst also providing opportunities to meet the 
development needs in full. The strategic residential allocations will create new 
convenience retail floorspace only to serve the local communities and this 
provision will need to complement rather than compete with the existing local 
centres.
9.7 Retail requirements are typically split into two categories: comparison goods 
and convenience goods. As Didcot is already delivering convenience retail 
against the identified requirement, any further provision of convenience retail 
within Didcot Town Centre within this plan period would result in surplus 
provision within the town centre, thereby impacting on vitality and viability 
of other centres. Provision for additional retail floorspace within Didcot town 
centre will therefore be for comparison goods. 
Policy TC2: Town Centre Hierarchy 
1. The Council will promote the continued role and functions of the 37 The quantum of development 
for convenience floorspace in 
the district to 2035 has been 
calculated on a pro-rata basis to 
take account of the additional 
years not assessed in the Retail 
Needs Assessment. Figures have 
been taken from the Addendum 
to the Retail and Leisure Needs 
Assessment 2016 – GVA 
Grimley Limited, published in 
2017.
38 This figure does not include 
the requirement arising from 
the strategic allocations, but 
only the need arising from 
the three market towns of 
Henley-on-Thames, Thame and 
Wallingford.South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020213
town centres to positively contribute towards their viability,   vitality,  
character and structure. The hierarchy of centres in the district is:
• Major town centre: Didcot, Henley-on-Thames
• Town centre: Thame, Wallingford
• Local centre: Berinsfield, Benson, Chalgrove, Chinnor, Cholsey, 
Crowmarsh Gifford, Goring-on-Thames, Nettlebed, Sonning 
Common, Watlington, Wheatley, Woodcote.
2. The Policies Map identifies the boundaries of the four town centres.
3. To ensure the long-term vitality and viability of the town centres,   the 
Council will apply a ‘town centre first’ approach to retail,   services 
and other main town centre uses in accordance with the established 
hierarchy of centres.
4. For our local centres,   development proposals will be permitted that:
i) provide retail and leisure uses within the centres through infill 
development and small scale redevelopment;
ii) provide small scale retail or leisure development that 
contributes to the vitality and viability of the villages whilst not 
undermining the retail roles of the towns;
iii) seek to improve access and movement for all users.
5. Development proposals for uses within Class E will be permitted 
within the town centre boundaries. Retail,   leisure,   office and other 
main town centre uses will continue to be directed to these centres in 
line with the sequential approach set out in the NPPF39. 
6. Where planning permission is required any retail,   leisure and office 
development proposed outside these centres must be subject to an 
impact assessment,   appropriate to the use,   where the proposed gross 
floorspace is greater than the local threshold of 500sqm. 
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8.
9.8 The Government, through the NPPF, support a town centre first approach 
when locating development for town centre uses as this ensures the vitality 
and viability of the centres. It also promotes mixed-use development. The 
network of town centres set out in this policy reflect the NPPF requirement 
on local planning authorities to apply a sequential test and/or impact test to 
planning applications for main town centre uses. 39 NPPF, para 86214
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 20209.9 The position of a centre in the hierarchy reflects its size, range of services, and 
facilities, as well as the size of its catchment area. In particular:
i) Didcot and Henley-on-Thames town centres are the main social, cultural 
and economic foci for the district. They have good access to major roads 
and rail links and benefit from a quality shopping environment. For 
Henley-on-Thames, this is combined with a high tourist/leisure offer. The 
sequential approach suggests that they should be the first choice for retail, 
leisure, community employment and main town centre uses. 
ii) Thame and Wallingford will be the focus of more localised town centre 
retail, commercial and community facilities, leisure and services that reduce 
the need to travel. 
iii) Local centres include shopping parades, individual shops and facilities to 
cater for day-to-day needs such as a small supermarket, newsagent, post 
office, takeaway and pharmacy. These facilities provide a convenient and 
sustainable choice within walking distance. 
9.10 Aside from the above centres, small parades/local shops not covered by this 
policy are still an important feature within a neighbourhood. Where new local 
parades/shops are provided, like those planned for within strategic allocations, 
they are required to meet the day-to-day need of the local community only. An 
exception is Chalgrove Airfield where it is expected a greater level of provision 
will be supported given the scale and location of the development and the 
need to promote more sustainable travel patterns. A Retail Impact Assessment 
is required to ensure proposals do not have a significant adverse impact on the 
district’s town centres.
9.11 The Council considers that the national threshold for a Retail Impact 
Assessment of 2,500sqm is not appropriate for the district. The Retail and 
Leisure Needs Assessment (2016) identifies that while Didcot is performing 
well, the other centres are relatively small and could potentially be adversely 
impacted upon by out-of-centre development. 
9.12 Modern retailers selling a range of comparison goods generally have a 
requirement for a larger format unit. A threshold of 500sqm is deemed 
appropriate for protecting the vitality and viability of the district’s centres when 
considering the size of the smallest ‘main’ foodstore in the district is 569sqm. 
The retail impact analysis threshold will be kept under review. 
9.13 While greater use of public transport, cycling and walking is central to 
sustainable development, appropriate levels of car parking will be maintained 
in key locations in order to maintain the viability of shopping centres. The 
Council will, without inducing unmanageable traffic flows, ensure that the 
economic viability of town centres is not undermined by the inability of While greater

shoppers to find a safe, secure and well laid out parking space in reasonable 
proximity to the shops.  
Policy TC3: Comparison Goods Floorspace Requirements
1. Didcot Town Centre will remain the focus for comparison goods 
floorspace requirements. The additional retail floorspace at the 
Orchard Centre Phase II development will meet the identified 
comparison requirements in the district up until 2027. 
2. Appropriately-scaled developments on smaller town centre 
opportunity sites elsewhere in the district may also be appropriate.
3. In Henley-on-Thames,   Thame and Wallingford there is no qualitative 
need for additional comparison goods floorspace during the plan 
period. Applications for new comparison goods floorspace in these 
town centres should be treated on their individual merits. 
4. Applications for comparison retail located outside of town centres will 
be required to demonstrate compliance with the sequential test and 
the locally set retail impact threshold (500sqm or as modified by the 
Council in response to the latest evidence).
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 3, 5 & 6.
Policy TC4: Convenience Floorspace Provision in the 
Market Towns
1. Each of the three Market Towns should make provision for a single 
format food store with at least 1,500sqm net sales floorspace. As 
per Policy TC2,   ‘a town centre first’ approach will be expected to be 
undertaken and then,   if this is not appropriate,   edge of centre and 
then a criteria based selection assessment. This will be provided at the 
following locations:

This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 3, 5 & 6.
9.14 The 2017 Retail Assessment Update identified a qualitative requirement to 
plan for additional convenience goods provision in Henley-on-Thames, Thame 
and Wallingford up to 2033. It recommends no pressing need to plan for 
additional convenience goods provision in Didcot, due to foodstore openings. 
The main convenience goods offer in Didcot town centre includes Sainsbury’s 
(approximate net floor area 4,000sqm) and a M&S food hall (approximate net 
floor area 1,000sqm) within the Orchard Centre as well as Aldi on Broadway 
(approximate net floor area 1,140sqm).
9.15 The convenience goods floorspace required to meet day-to-day needs within the 
strategic allocations will be dealt with in each of the respective STRAT policies.
9.16 The Joint Henley-Harpsden Neighbourhood Development Plan has identified a 
key opportunity site to accommodate retail floorspace requirements in Henley-
on-Thames. The Local Plan is supportive of this opportunity. 
9.17 The Council will support the future review of the Joint Henley-Harpsden and 
Thame Neighbourhood Development Plans to identify suitable locations for 
convenience retail development. 
9.18 In Wallingford, permission was granted in 2018 for a Lidl food store (P17/ 
S3651/FUL) at Lupton Road on the Hithercroft Industrial Estate with a net 
tradeable floor area of 2,125sqm. This site is now operational and the 
convenience goods floor space requirement for Wallingford has been met for 
the duration of the plan period.Location

Policy TC5 – Primary Shopping Areas
1. Appendix 13 identifies the boundaries of the Primary Shopping Areas.
2. Where planning permission is required,   proposals resulting in the loss 
of an E Class Use at ground floor must demonstrate that:
i) the unit has been proactively and appropriately marketed for at 
least 12 months and it has been demonstrated that there is no 
longer a realistic prospect of the unit being used for E Class uses  
in the foreseeable future;
ii) the proposal meets the needs of residents within the local 
neighbourhood; and
iii) the proposal will not have an adverse impact on the vitality and 
viability of the centre as a whole. 
3. Proposals for main town centre uses outside the Primary Shopping 
Areas,   over the relevant thresholds will only be permitted provided 
the sequential test and an accompanying impact assessment have 
indicated that is appropriate to do so.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 3 & 6.
9.19 A Primary Shopping Area is defined in the NPPF as an area where retail 
development is concentrated. 
9.20 Retail developments are significant trip attractors and should be located in 
places that are well-connected by public transport. Improving the attractiveness 
of primary shopping areas through sustainable modes of transport through 
improved public realm will support the vitality of the primary shopping area. 
9.21 Historically, non-retail uses were resisted in primary shopping areas; however, 
changes in retail trends and technology need to be taken into consideration as 
part of future development assessment.218
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020219COMMUNITY AND 
RECREATIONAL FACILITIES 
Introduction 
 10.1 The ability to access local shops, meeting places, sports venues, cultural 
buildings, public houses and places of worship forms an essential part of the 
quality of life for residents of the district. We recognise the importance of these 
community facilities in promoting social interaction and cohesive communities 
and the Local Plan promotes the retention and development of local services 
and community facilities in its towns and villages.
 10.2 It is important that there is a sufficient network of facilities across the district. 
We need to provide the right type of housing in our towns and villages, 
particularly our smaller settlements, to attract young people and families who 
will support the sustainable provision of facilities and help to ensure their 
vibrancy. We recognise that there is pressure on local services, particularly 
schools, doctors surgeries and community facilities, and the need to provide 
facilities for all parts of the community, including disabled people and young 
people.
 10.3 Planning plays an important role in safeguarding existing and developing new 
community and recreational facilities as it can create new opportunities for 
exchanges and interactions between a variety of community members. 
 10.4 Much of our role in ensuring there are sufficient community and recreational 
facilities is undertaken in the preparation of the Local Plan and when 
determining planning applications. In determining planning applications for 
the loss of community facilities, we will be guided by our Community Facilities 
Viability Assessment40. 
 10.5 We will require developers to make contributions towards the provision of new 
community and recreational facilities and the ongoing maintenance of existing 
facilities.
 10.6 We will also support communities in protecting, enhancing and delivering 
community and recreation facilities in their towns and villages. Town and 
Parish Councils can seek to do this through the preparation of Neighbourhood 
Development Plans, Neighbourhood Development Orders or they may 
construct or rebuild community buildings under a Community Right to Build 
Order. Local communities are also able to identify buildings or open space that 
are of value to them and apply for them to be listed as Assets of Community

Policy CF1: Safeguarding Community Facilities 
1. Proposals that result in the loss of an essential community facility 
or service*,   through change of use or redevelopment,   will not be 
permitted unless:
i) it would lead to the significant improvement of an existing 
facility or the replacement of an existing facility equally 
convenient to the local community it serves and with equivalent 
or improved facilities;
ii) it has been determined that the community facility is no longer 
needed; or
iii) in the case of commercial services,   it is not economically viable.
 
2. Appropriate,   detailed and robust evidence will be required to 
satisfy the above criteria. The Council will require the independent 
assessment of this evidence.
3. Planning conditions or legal obligations may be necessary to ensure 
that any replacement facility and its ongoing maintenance is provided. 
Any replacement facility should normally be available before the 
original facility is lost.
4. A community facility or service may be essential,   either because it 
is one of a limited number of that nature in a settlement or area,   or 
is fundamental to the quality and convenience of everyday life in 
a settlement. This includes the protection of Public Rights of Way 
including bridleways and by-ways. If suitable alternative provision 
already exists,   any facility or service will not be considered essential. 
* Facilities under Use Class F2 Local Community Uses (shops smaller than 
280sqm and without another shop in 1,000 metres, a hall or meeting place 
for the principal use of the local community, outdoor sport or recreation 
locations, and swimming pools or skating rinks), Use Class F1 Learning and 
non-residential institutions, and the following Sui Generis uses: drinking 
establishments, cinemas, concert/dance/bingo halls, theatres.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 3, 4, 6 & 7
 10.7 In the interests of the well-being of local communities, it is important to 
protect the existing community facilities in our towns and villages wherever South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020221
possible, by resisting their loss to another use. The Council will give priority to 
the retention and enhancement of community uses on established sites. 
Policy CF2: Provision of Community Facilities and Services
1. Development proposals for the provision of new or extended 
community facilities and services will be supported,   particularly 
where:
i) they are located within or adjacent to the built-up area of an 
existing settlement;
ii) they would clearly meet an identified local need; and
iii) they are accessible for all members of the community and 
promote social inclusion.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 1, 3, 4, 6 & 7.
 10.8 In general, the Council will welcome proposals involving the provision of new 
community facilities and services including Public Rights of Way for the local 
population, provided that there are no overriding objections to the proposal. 
The provision and improvement of public house facilities will also be considered 
in relation to policies CF1 and CF2.
 10.9  In the event that a community identifies the need for a new local facility, the 
Council will support the community in exploring this through a Neighbourhood 
Development Plan and/or Community Right to Build Order.
 
Recreation
 10.10  Access to high quality open spaces and opportunities for sport and recreation 
make an important contribution to the health and well-being of the residents 
of and visitors to South Oxfordshire, and also provide a range of benefits 
including biodiversity, Green Infrastructure and visual amenity. National 
guidance recognises the important role that the planning system has in 
facilitating healthy communities through providing access to high quality 
facilities for sport and recreation, including open spaces for informal recreation.
Policy CF3: New Open Space, Sport and Recreation Facilities
1. Proposals for sport and recreation facilities will be encouraged and 
supported in line with other policies in the Plan and Sport England 222
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020
guidance. Where possible new sports and recreation facilities should 
be co-located with other community uses and be well related to the 
settlements they serve,   being sited within or adjacent to settlements. 
Where new,   major facilities for outdoor sport are to be provided they 
should,   as far as possible,   be accessible by public transport. Provision 
for the future long-term maintenance and management of the open 
space and/or facilities will be sought and must be agreed as part of 
the planning application.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 3, 4, 6, 7 & 8.
 10.11  The Council will encourage and support proposals for new sport and recreation 
facilities provided that they are appropriately located to serve the local 
population and, if appropriate, the wider population by public transport. The 
long term maintenance and management of the facilities must be agreed 
as part of any planning application and may need to be set out in a legal 
agreement. The Council will also explore options for the management of new 
areas of open space to be undertaken by community owned and run trusts.
 
Policy CF4: Existing Open Space, Sport and Recreation 
Facilities
1. The Council will seek to protect,   maintain and where possible enhance 
existing open space,   sport and recreation,   play facilities and land 
including playing fields to ensure their continued contribution to 
the health and well-being of visitors and residents. Development 
proposals that result in the loss of such facilities will only be permitted 
where:
i) it can be demonstrated that alternative facilities of equal or 
better quality will be provided in an equally accessible location 
as part of the development;
ii) the development is for alternative sports and recreational 
provision,   the needs for which clearly outweigh the loss; or
iii) an assessment has been undertaken which has clearly shown 
the open space,   buildings or land to be surplus to requirements.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 4, 6 & 7.
 10.12  The policy above is intended to safeguard all existing recreation facilities 
whether formal or informal or publicly owned, and whether buildings or open 
land, including allotments. This is considered important in view of the growing South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020223
demand for recreational facilities and the restrictions on public spending. There 
is also increasing concern about the loss of recreational facilities, particularly 
within more urban areas, as once land is lost to development it cannot be 
brought back into recreational use if a need arises for further provision in the 
future.
Policy CF5: Open Space, Sport and Recreation in New 
Residential Development
1. New residential development will be required to provide or contribute 
towards inclusive and accessible open space and play facilities having 
regard to the most up to date standards set out in the Open Spaces 
Study including:
• Amenity greenspace (including parks and gardens)
• Allotments
• Equipped children’s play areas
2. New residential development will be required to provide or contribute 
towards accessible sport and recreation facilities,   including playing 
pitches,   having regard to the Council’s most up to date Leisure Study,  
and Sport England guidance.
3. The provision of open space,   sport,   recreation and play facilities,   and 
playing pitches is expected to be delivered on site,   unless this is 
demonstrated not to be feasible.
4. Provision for the future long-term maintenance and management of 
the open space and facilities will be sought and must be agreed as 
part of the planning application.
This policy contributes towards achieving objectives 4, 6, 7 & 8.
 10.13  Provision of the new facilities should be made within the development site 
itself and in perpetuity. Where it is demonstrated that on-site provision is 
wholly or partially infeasible, a financial contribution will be required and 
collected through our adopted Community Infrastructure Levy. The future 
management of open space and/or facilities provided on site will need to be 
agreed with the local planning authority to ensure that residents can enjoy the 
benefits of them in the long term.
 10.14 Proposals for recreational facilities should consider the potential that such 
features may have for attracting crime and anti-social behaviour.224

225   MONITORING AND REVIEW
11.1 Monitoring the performance of the Development Plan is essential to assess 
its effectiveness and to record whether proposals and policies are being 
implemented and delivered. The outputs of appropriate monitoring will 
enable us to be fully informed of the progress of development in the area and 
whether a full or partial review of the Plan is necessary.
11.2 The NPPF sets out that plans should be flexible to adapt to changing 
circumstances. As detailed in the introduction to this Plan, we are committed 
to reviewing the Plan if delivery issues emerge through monitoring, and will 
implement measures to ensure that housing, employment and infrastructure 
needs are met during the plan period.
11.3 In order to ensure effective monitoring a framework has been prepared setting 
out key indicators that will track the delivery of the Plan.
11.4 The tables below set out the indicators and targets in relation to each policy 
in the Local Plan. The range of indicators reflect SODC’s relationship with 
other plans and programmes and therefore includes indicators required by 
Government as part of the “Single List”, “Contextual Indicators” (CI) which 
relate to local characteristics and issues of the locality and other “Local 
Indicators” such as those from the Local Transport Plan (LTP).
11.5 The monitoring outcomes for each Development Plan Document will be 
reported in each Authority’s Monitoring Report (AMR). The AMR is required 
to outline the progress in preparing the documents and assess the extent 
to which the policies are being implemented and their effectiveness. Where 
a policy is not meeting its objective, the AMR will explain why and suggest 
what action should be taken. For key policies relating to strategic housing or 
employment, these actions have been set out within the policy. The monitoring 
framework itself will be reviewed as part of the AMR.

Access to Natural Greenspace Standard (ANGSt)
ANGSt is a tool in assessing current levels of accessible 
natural greenspace, and planning for better provision. 
The three underlying principles of ANGSt are:
 a) Improving access to greenspaces
 b) Improving naturalness of greenspaces
 c) Improving connectivity with greenspaces
ANGST sets a maximum recommended standard on 
walking distance people should have to travel to have 
access to accessible natural greenspace. For more 
information see “Nature Nearby” publication from

Adopted Policies Map 
A map of the local planning authority’s area which 
must be reproduced from, or based on, an Ordnance 
Survey map; include an explanation of any symbol or 
notation which it uses; and illustrate geographically the 
application of the policies in the adopted Development 
Plan. Where the adopted policies map consists of text 
and maps, the text prevails if the map and text conflict.
Adoption 
Formal approval by the Council of a DPD or SPD where 
upon it achieves its full weight in making planning 
decisions.
Affordable Housing 
Affordable housing: housing for sale or rent, for those 
whose needs are not met by the market (including 
housing that provides a subsidised route to home 
ownership and/or is for essential local workers); and 
which complies with one or more of the following 
definitions:
a)  Affordable housing for rent: meets all of the 
following conditions: 
(a)  the rent is set in accordance with the 
Government’s rent policy for Social Rent or Affordable Rent, or is at least 20% below local 
market rents (including service charges where 
applicable); 
(b) the landlord is a registered provider, except 
where it is included as part of a Build to Rent 
scheme (in which case the landlord need not be 
a registered provider); and 
(c) it includes provisions to remain at an affordable 
price for future eligible households, or for the 
subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable 
housing provision. For Build to Rent schemes 
affordable housing for rent is expected to 
be the normal form of affordable housing 
provision (and, in this context, is known as 
Affordable Private Rent). 
b)  Starter homes: is as specified in Sections 2 and 3 
of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 and any 
secondary legislation made under these sections. 
The definition of a starter home should reflect the 
meaning set out in statute and any such secondary 
legislation at the time of plan-preparation or 
decision-making. Where secondary legislation has 
the effect of limiting a household’s eligibility to 
purchase a starter home to those with a particular 
maximum level of household income, those 
restrictions should be used. 
c)  Discounted market sales housing: is that sold at 
a discount of at least 20% below local market 
value. Eligibility is determined with regard to local 
incomes and local house prices. Provisions should 
be in place to ensure housing remains at a discount 
for future eligible households.
d)  Other affordable routes to home ownership: is 
housing provided for sale that provides a route to 
ownership for those who could not achieve home 
ownership through the market. It includes shared 
ownership, relevant equity loans, other low cost 
homes for sale (at a price equivalent to at least 
20% below local market value) and rent to buy 
(which includes a period of intermediate rent). 
Where public grant funding is provided, there 
should be provisions for the homes to remain at 
an affordable price for future eligible households, 
or for any receipts to be recycled for alternative 
affordable housing provision, or refunded to 
Government or the relevant authority specified in 
the funding agreement.244
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035     DECEMBER 2020Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) 
Areas designated by local authorities because they are 
not likely to achieve national air quality objectives by 
the relevant deadlines.
Ancient Monument 
Any scheduled monument, or any other monument, 
which in the opinion of the Secretary of State, is of 
public interest by reason of the historic, architectural, 
artistic or archaeological interest attributed to it.
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) 
A national designation to conserve and enhance the 
natural beauty of the landscape. The AONBs in South 
Oxfordshire are the North Wessex Downs and the 
Chilterns.
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Management 
Plan 
The Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Management 
Plans for the Chilterns and the North Wessex 
Downs contain comprehensive summaries of the 
key issues facing the areas and the management 
policies and actions needed to conserve the areas.

Authority Monitoring Report (AMR) 
A report produced at least annually assessing: progress 
with the preparation of the Local Plan and other 
policy documents against the timetable published in 
the Local Development Scheme, and the extent to 
which adopted plan policies are being successfully 
implemented.
Better Broadband for Oxfordshire Project 
Better Broadband for Oxfordshire is a £25m project 
to bring fibre broadband to over 90% of homes and 
businesses in the county. It’s a collaboration between 
Oxfordshire County Council, the Government (through 
BDUK) and BT that will boost the local economy by 
creating and protecting jobs. For more information

Biodiversity 
Biodiversity is seen as the total complexity of all life, 
including not only the great variety of organisms, but 
also their varying behaviour and interactions.Building Research Establishment Environment 
Assessment Method (BREEAM) 
A widely used environmental assessment method 
for buildings. BREEAM assesses buildings against set 
criteria for sustainable building design, construction 
and operation, and provides an overall score.
Burgage Plots
Long, narrow plots, laid out at right angles to the 
street frontage, with the rear often accessed by a back 
lane. Burgage plots were generally laid out in blocks, 
as acts of medieval town planning, comprising plots 
of often uniform width (sometimes 6 metres). A main 
building, generally shops or houses, occupied the 
frontage, with the rear containing ancillary buildings, 
and open space which was often used for digging cess 
pits and rubbish pits. The boundaries between plots 
may now be marked by high stone or brick walls, and 
in some cases, much or even all of the open space 
may now have been built on. Their regular width sets 
the rhythm of the street, within which buildings of 
various dates and styles provide variety. Remaining 
open land at the rear provides an important haven for 
wildlife and acts as a ‘green lung’ in otherwise densely 
developed and populated areas.
Carbon Compliance 
The overall onsite contribution to zero carbon.
Chalk Streams
There are around 224 known chalk streams in 
England, which constitutes over 85% of the total 
world resource. As a result chalk rivers have been 
specifically identified as a priority for conservation 
under Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural 
Communities Act (2006) (s41 Natural Environment 
and Rural Communities Act 2006, available at: www.
legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/16/contents). In 
South Oxfordshire they are generally fed from aquifers 
in the chalk rocks of the Chiltern Hills, the water is 
characterised as having high clarity and quality, with 
a stable temperature regime. It is the quality of the 
water as well as the in stream and bankside habitats 
that make chalk streams so important for a variety 
of rare and protected species. Chalk streams in the 
district arise from the escarpment of the Chiltern Hills, 
examples include the Ewelme Brook and the Chalgrove 
Brook. It is estimated that only around a quarter of 
Britain’s chalk streams are achieving good ecological 
status under the Water Framework Directive (World 
Wildlife Fund (WWF) (2015) The State of England’s South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020245Chalk Streams), available at: http://assets.wwf.org.

Climate Change Adaptation
Adjustments to natural or human systems in 
response to actual or expected climatic factors or 
their effects, including from changes in rainfall and 
rising temperatures, which moderate harm or exploit 
beneficial opportunities. 
Climate Change Mitigation
Action to reduce the impact of human activity on the 
climate system, primarily through reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions.
Code for Sustainable Homes (The Code) 
Provides a comprehensive measure of sustainability 
of a new home by rating and certifying new homes 
against nine categories of sustainable design: energy/
CO2, pollution, water, health and well-being,

Policy
n/a  2.3 13
n/a  2.5 13The visioning section of the Plan supports high standards 
of design. Since the publication of the National Design 
Guide in October 2019, it is implied that the phrase “high 
standards of design” includes factors such as resources and 
lifespan as these are identified as key characteristics of good 
design by the guide. The South Oxfordshire Design Guide 
SPD identifies the key design objectives for development 
that is “sustainable and resilient to climate change and 
minimises energy consumption and mitigates water run-off 
and flood risks”. This approach is key to addressing climate 
change in new development.
The vision supports walking, cycling and active travel 
through improvements to the cycle network that will 
contribute to reducing carbon emissions generated through 
travel choices.…New development will meet the highest
standards of design with necessary associated 
infrastructure.
…Roads and rail links will have been improved 
and pedestrian and cycle networks will have made 
it easier for people to get around, in particular to 
major employment sites.
South Oxfordshire District Council Local Plan 2035      DECEMBER 2020
297South Oxfordshire District Council declared a Climate Emergency on 3 April 2019.  A parliamentary declaration of a Climate Emergency was made during the spring 
of the same year. The parliamentary declaration led to the target within the Climate Change Act 2008 being made more challenging.  The change was enacted on 
27 June 2019 and requires the UK to achieve a 100% reduction in Carbon emissions by 2050 as measured against 1990 levels. South Oxfordshire District Council 
has sought to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to climate change, where possible, through the policies within the Local Plan. This appendix outlines the ways 
in which the policies and proposals within the Plan seek to address climate change in accordance with the legislative framework as at June 2020. This appendix 
is intended to signpost how the Local Plan satisfies the provisions of Section 19 (1A) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 which requires that: 
“Development Plan Documents must (taken as a whole) include policies designed to secure that the development and use of land in the local planning authority’s 
area contribute to the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change.”
It is noted that the UK is undergoing a transitionary period with regard to the exit from the European Union, proposed changes to building regulations and the 
enactment of the Environment Bill.  The monitoring framework that has been put in place will be used to ensure that the policies are acting to achieve the required 
carbon reductions.
How climate change is addressed through the Local PlanAppendix 16  
How climate change is addressed in the Local PlanThe objective supports walking, cycling and active travel by 
reducing commuting distances to reduce carbon emissions 
generated through travel choices.
The objective supports walking, cycling and active travel by 
balancing economic and housing growth to help achieve a 
reduction in the need for car-based commuting to reduce 
carbon emissions generated through travel choices.
The objective supports walking, cycling and active travel to 
reduce carbon emissions generated through travel choices.
The adopted South Oxfordshire Design Guide SPD is 
referred to throughout the Plan and the principles set out in 
the guide have been adopted through the Local Plan.  The 
principles include minimisation of environmental impacts 
and the construction of sustainable buildings appropriate to 
their function and context.
The objective is fundamental to addressing climate change 
through the Local Plan. The need to minimise carbon 
emissions and other pollutants and take actions to mitigate 
and adapt to the effects of climate change is fundamental 
to addressing the climate change emergency.Aim to reduce commuting distances by supporting 
business growth in locations close to existing 
business areas, transport connections and 
broadband provision.
Ensure economic and housing growth are 
balanced, to support sustainable journeys to work, 
recognising that we cannot determine where 
people work – some of whom will choose to travel 
to employment locations beyond our district, such 
as London, Oxford and Reading.
Make sustainable transport, walking and cycling 
an attractive and viable choice for people, whilst 
recognising that car travel and parking provision 
will continue to be important in this predominantly 
rural district.
Deliver high quality, innovative, well designed 
and locally distinctive developments in sustainable 
locations with regard to the South Oxfordshire 
Design Guide.
Minimise carbon emissions and other pollution 
such as water, air, noise and light, and increase 
our resilience to the likely impact of climate 
change, especially flooding. Lower energy use 
and support an increase in renewable energy use. 
Support growth in locations that help to reduce 
the need to travel.OBJ 3.2 n/a 16

Support a movement strategy that strengthens 
connections to key places, allows a choice of 
transport modes and manages traffic to improve 
environmental quality;
The spatial strategy supports growth in locations 
that help reduce the need to travel such as the 
focus at Science Vale, Towns and Larger Villages as 
well as allocations adjacent to the City of Oxford. 
Appendix 16 of the Local Plan highlights all 
elements of the Local Plan where the Plan helps to 
minimise carbon emissions, lower energy use and 
help to reduce the need to travel.
• Focusing major new development in Science 
Vale including sustainable growth at Didcot 
Garden Town and Culham so that this area 
can play an enhanced role in providing homes, 
jobs and services with improved transport 
connectivity;
• Providing strategic allocations…including 
necessary infrastructure and community 
facilities;
• Supporting and enhancing the economic and 
social dependencies between our towns and 
villages;
• Supporting the roles of Henley-on-Thames, 
Thame and Wallingford by maintaining and 
improving the attractiveness of their town The overall strategy will help address climate change 
through improving resilience and supporting adaptation 
and mitigation measures.
Support for walking, cycling and active travel to reduce 
carbon emissions generated through travel choices.
The overall spatial strategy focuses growth in locations that 
will help to reduce carbon emissions generated through 
travel choices, minimise carbon emissions generated 
through development and lower energy use. This table is 
intended to highlight where the Plan has acted to carry out 
these actions.
The policy includes the consideration of the contribution 
to tackling climate change as a priority consideration for 
all development that accords with the overall strategy of 
the Plan. The Local Plan seeks to build upon the existing 
settlement hierarchy and actively create a sustainable 
pattern of development throughout the district.  
Development is focused primarily at Science Vale and 
sustainable settlements (which include towns and larger 
villages). This is complemented by locating development 
next to the neighbouring major urban area of Oxford, 
the identification of new settlements, and the location of 
development to fund regeneration and by raising densities. 
Drawing on a combined approach to the distribution of 
development enables a series of benefits to be delivered 
through the Plan and this ensures that the development

sustainable way. A key outcome of the spatial strategy is 
the minimisation of the need to travel to help to reduce 
carbon emissions generated through travel choices. 
 
Improved connections between Science Vale and Didcot 
will provide opportunities to make active travel a primary 
transport alternative to reduce carbon emissions generated 
through travel choices.
The strategic approach to Science Vale supports active 
travel and public transport to reduce carbon emissions 
generated through travel choices. Excellent design

where that need arises;
• Supporting and enhancing the roles of the 
larger villages…. as local service centres;
• Supporting smaller and other villages by 
allowing for limited amounts of housing and 
employment to help secure the provision and 
retention of services;
• Contributing to tacking climate change.
…An important part of our strategy for Science 
Vale is to improve and strengthen its relationship 
with Didcot, and realise Didcot’s full potential as 
a thriving and attractive location to live, work and 
visit. We will do this by providing the homes, jobs, 
skills, and infrastructure needed to turn Didcot into 
a successful and sustainable town in its own right, 
and a vital part of a thriving Science Vale.
Our strategic approach for Science Vale…
• Excellent design embedded in development 
throughout Science Vale
• A “step change” in travel choices away from 
car travel towards public transport, cycling 
and walking with Didcot at the heart of a fully 
connected Science Vale

a statement on addressing climate change. This will Transport and movement - The Garden Town will 
reduce reliance on motorised vehicles and will 
promote a step-change towards active and public 
transport through the creation of a highly legible, 
attractive and accessible movement network and 
the appropriate location of housing, employment 
and leisure facilities. The Garden Town will seek 
to improve opportunities for access to sport 
and physical activities through Sport England’s 
active Design Principles. Cycling and pedestrian 
links between the Garden Town, its surrounding 
villages, natural assets and the strategic 
employment sites will be enhanced.
Landscape and Green Infrastructure - New 
development in the Garden Town will enhance 
the natural environment, through enhancing 
green and blue infrastructure networks, creating 
ecological networks to support an increase (or 
where possible achieve a net gain) in biodiversity 
and supporting climate resilience through the 
use of adaptation and design measures. The 
Garden Town will also seek to make effective use 
of natural resources including energy and water 
efficiency, as well as exploring opportunities for 
promoting new technology within developments. 
Innovative habitat planting and food growing 
zones will characterise the Garden Town and, in 
turn, these measures will support quality of life 
and public health.

Sites well related to existing towns and villages 
and served by public transport or with good 
accessibility by foot or bicycle to the town centres 
of Didcot, Henley, Thame and Wallingford or 
a district centre within Oxford City should be 
capable of accommodating development at 
higher densities. It is expected that these sites will 
accommodate densities of more than 45 dph (net) 
unless there is clear conflict with delivering a high-
quality design or other clearly justified planning 
reasons for a lower density.

by highway improvements on the B480 corridor, 
and an east west bus service linking Chalgrove 
to Didcot (and where feasible other employment help decision makers ensure that climate change actions 
have been adequately considered in the planning of the 
development.
The policy requires each development to provide low 
carbon development and renewable energy which will 
directly reduce carbon emissions and help ensure that 
climate change actions have been considered in the 
planning of strategic and major development.
The policy requires higher density development in more 
sustainable locations, concentrating development in 
locations with more opportunity for active travel and public 
transport reducing carbon emissions generated through

and Grenoble Road. To enable the creation of 
sustainable communities and to provide new 
residents with the chance to work locally, the 
Local Plan proposes allocations for additional 
employment land at these locations to 
complement the strategic allocations. In addition, 
the Local Plan supports the provision of additional 
employment land at the four towns as these are 
sustainable locations where additional housing 
delivery will take place over the plan period.
It is important that local employment sites are 
retained to maintain a reasonable balance of 
employment and housing uses within settlements.  
This affords the residents of the villages, towns 
and surrounding areas the opportunity to find 
work locally. This need is particularly strong as 
a number of employment sites and premises 
have been redeveloped for housing in recent 
years. Local employment plays an important role 
in supporting local services and facilities and

The Transport Assessment or Transport Statement 
should, where relevant:
i) illustrate accessibility to the site by all modes of 
transport;
ii) show the likely modal split of journeys to and 
from the site;
iii) detail the proposed measures to improve access 
by public transport, cycling and walking to reduce 
the need for car travel and reduce transport 
impacts;
Proposals for all types of development will, where 
appropriate: 
ii) provide safe and convenient routes for cyclists 
and pedestrians, both within the development,

v) provide for appropriate public transport 
infrastructure;
ix) be designed to enable charging of plug-in and 
other low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and 
convenient locations;
xiv) provide facilities to support the take up of 
electric and/or low-emission vehicles.The policy requires development proposals that will 
generate significant transport impacts to be accompanied 
by a Transport Assessment that demonstrates how public 
transport provision and improvements will be secured 
and requires the active travel measures to be detailed. By 
focusing developers on these key aspects of their schemes, 
decision makers will be able to ensure that opportunities 
to maximise active travel and public transport have been 
taken.
The policy is the key delivery policy for climate change 
related transport actions.  The policy ensures that active 
travel routes are secured within development proposals and 
that walking, cycling and public transport infrastructure is 
integrated into development.  The policy also supports the 
use of electric and/or low emission vehicles through the 
provision of appropriate supporting infrastructure.

The policy requires excellent broadband connectivity for 
all development.  High quality internet connections are 
fundamental to reducing the need to travel, particularly for 
businesses and increasingly for home-based employees.
The policy requires the optional enhanced level of water 
efficiency as prescribed by current building regulations.
The policy requires that there is sufficient water available 
to serve new development without detriment to existing 
water sources, biodiversity or other land uses.  Applicants 
will need to work with Thames Water to ensure that the 
water needs of development can be provided and the policy 
approach supports the eventuality of the need for water 
neutral development over the course of the plan period.

South Oxfordshire’s landscape, countryside and 
rural areas will be protected against harmful 
development. Development will only be permitted 
where it protects and, where possible enhances, 
features that contribute to the nature and quality 
of South Oxfordshire’s valued landscapes, in 
particular:
i) Trees (including individual trees, groups of trees 
and woodlands), hedgerows and field boundaries; 
ii) Irreplaceable habitats such as ancient woodland 
and aged or veteran trees found outside ancient 
woodland;
iii) The landscapes, waterscapes, cultural heritage 
and user enjoyment of the River Thames, its 
tributaries and flood plains;
iv) Other watercourse and water bodies…
The Council will seek the retention of important 
hedgerows. Where retention is not possible and 
a proposal seeks the removal of a hedgerow, the 
Council will require compensatory planting with a 
mixture of native hedgerow species.
Trees and hedgerows, individually and collectively, 
can make an important contribution to biodiversity 
and the landscape. They also absorb atmospheric 
pollution and have a beneficial influence on the 
climate. Development proposals should provide 
a net increase in tree canopy cover where this is changing climate.
The policy ensures that development protects, and where 
possible enhances, natural features habitats that contribute 
to biodiversity and watercourses that are essential to 
managing the risks of flooding.
The policy protects hedgerows in recognition of their 
contribution to biodiversity, benefits of flood attenuation, 
cooling and shading and carbon capture and storage.
The supporting text recognises the beneficial contribution 
made by trees and hedgerows and requires a net increase in 
tree canopy where this is possible.

1. The highest level of protection will be given 
to sites of international nature conservation 
importance (Special Areas of Conservation).
Development that is likely to result in a significant 
effect, either alone or in combination, on such 
sites will need to satisfy the requirements of the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 
2017 (as amended).
2. Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) are of 
national importance. Development that is likely to 
have an adverse effect on a SSSI (either on its own 
or in combination with other developments) will 
only be permitted in exceptional circumstances, 
where it can be demonstrated that the benefits of 
the development in the location proposed clearly 
outweigh any harm to the special interest features 
and the SSSI’s contribution to the local ecological

the district as a whole across all non-protected sites.  The 
use of a biodiversity metric is required to ensure that net 
gains in biodiversity are achieved by development.  The 
policy recognises the need to enhance biodiversity where 
possible in view of the increased risks posed by climate 
change.1. Development that will conserve, restore 
and enhance biodiversity in the district will be 
supported. All development should provide a net 
gain in biodiversity where possible. As a minimum, 
there should be no net loss of biodiversity. All 
proposals should be supported by evidence 
to demonstrate a biodiversity net gain using a 
recognised biodiversity accounting metric.
2. Development proposals which would result in 
a net loss of biodiversity will only be considered 
if it can be demonstrated that alternatives which 
avoid impacts on biodiversity have been fully 
explored in accordance with the mitigation 
hierarchy*. In the absence of alternative sites or 
layouts, development proposals must include 
adequate mitigation measures to achieve a net 
gain of biodiversity. Where harm cannot be 
prevented or adequately mitigated, appropriate 
compensation measures will be sought, as a last 
resort, through planning conditions or planning 
obligations (depending on the circumstances of 
each application) to offset the loss by contributing 
to appropriate biodiversity projects to achieve an 
overall net gain for biodiversity.
3. Planning permission will only be granted if 
impacts on biodiversity can be avoided, mitigated 
or, as a last resort, compensated fully.

adjacent to a watercourse must protect and where 
possible, enhance the function and setting of the

development should provide mitigation for any 
unavoidable impacts.
2. Development should include a minimum 10m 
buffer zone along both sides of the watercourse to 
create a corridor favourable to the enhancement 
of biodiversity. Where a 10m wide buffer zone 
is not considered possible by the local planning 
authority, (for example in dense urban areas 
where existing development comes closer to 
the watercourse) a smaller buffer zone may be 
allowed, but should still be accompanied by 
detailed plans to show how the land will be used 
to promote biodiversity and how maintenance 
access to the watercourse will be created. 
Wherever possible within settlements a minimum 
10m buffer should be maintained.
 
3. Proposals should avoid the culverting of any 
watercourse. Opportunities taken to remove 
culverts will be supported.
4. Outside settlements, proposals for mooring 
stages will not be permitted. Proposals for posts, 
earthworks or facing riverbanks with piles and 
planking will not be permitted except under 
exceptional circumstances and in agreement with 
the Environment Agency. Where it is necessary to

with the Council before commencement of work 
to ensure that the watercourse will be satisfactorily 
protected from damage, disturbance or pollution. 
6. Sites for new development with existing culverts 
will be expected to investigate the feasibility of 
de-culverting the watercourse. Where bridges 
are proposed as an alternative to culverting, the 
construction method should take into account 
the importance of maintaining an obstruction free 
bank for wildlife.
Watercourses are vital to biodiversity, provide a 
unique range of habitats, act as wildlife corridors, 
and form an important element of South 
Oxfordshire’s ecological network. They make a 
significant contribution towards the character 
of our landscape and form an important part of 
Green Infrastructure. They provide vital ecosystem 
services, help improve water quality, provide 
drainage and flood management and provide 
green space for informal recreation. Of specific 
note are South Oxfordshire’s globally rare chalk 
streams which support special wildlife habitats and 
species.

into development can provide attractive riverside 
settings, natural areas of Green Infrastructure and 
areas for informal recreation. 
All development proposals adjacent to 
watercourses should avoid damaging impacts and 
provide mitigation for any unavoidable impacts.

laid out in the Council’s Developer Guidance 
Document and the associated Air Quality Action 
Plan, as well as the national air quality guidance 
and any Local Transport Plans;  
ii) where sensitive development is proposed in 
areas of existing poor air quality and/or where 
significant development is proposed, an Air Quality 
Assessment will be required;
iii) all development proposals should include 
measures to minimise air pollution at the design 
stage and incorporate best practice in the design, 
construction and operation of the development;
iv) where a development has a negative impact 
on air quality, including cumulative impact, 
developers should identify mitigation measures 
that will sufficiently minimise emissions from the 
development. Where mitigation is not sufficient 
the impacts should be offset through planning 
obligations; and
v) development will only be permitted where 
it does not exceed air pollution levels set by

minimised through:  
i) directing new development to areas with the 
lowest probability of flooding;
ii) ensuring that all new development addresses 
the effective management of all sources of flood 
risk; 
iii) ensuring that development does not increase 
the risk of flooding elsewhere; and
iv) ensuring wider environmental benefits of 
development in relation to flood risk.
2. The suitability of development proposed 
in Flood Zones will be strictly assessed using 
the ‘Sequential Test’ and where necessary the 
‘Exceptions Test’. A sequential approach should be 
used at site level. 
3. A site-specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) The policy sets out the requirements for locating 
development in areas at least risk of flooding and the need 
for flood risk assessments and drainage strategies.  The

Areas of South Oxfordshire are at risk of flooding 
and the impact of climate change is important. 
Climate change allowances should be taken into 
consideration in Flood Risk Assessments as set out 
in National Planning Practice Guidance…
1. All new development must be of a high-quality 
design that:
i)  uses land efficiently while respecting the existing 
landscape character; 
ii)  enhances biodiversity and, as a minimum, leads 
to no net loss of habitat; 
iii)  incorporates and/or links to a well-defined 
network of green and blue infrastructure;
iv)  is sustainable and resilient to climate change;
v)  minimises energy consumption;
vi)  mitigates water run-off and flood risks; 
vii)  takes into account landform, layout, building 
orientation, massing and landscaping;
viii)  provides a clear and permeable hierarchy 
of streets, routes and spaces to create safe and 
convenient ease of movement by all users; 
ix)  ensures that streets and spaces are well 
overlooked creating a positive relationship 
between fronts and backs of buildings; 
x)  clearly defines public and private spaces; 
xi)  provides access to local services and facilities 
and, where needed, incorporates mixed uses, 
facilities and co-locates services as appropriate 
with good access to public transport; The supporting text notes the importance of ensuring that 
climate change allowances are considered within flood risk 
assessments.
The policy identifies the key characteristics of high-quality 
design.  By definition, high quality designs are identified as 
those that are sustainable and resilient to climate change.  
In addition, Policy DES1 identifies key characteristics of 
design that help to respond to climate change.
The policy seeks to integrate the requirements to minimise 
energy consumption and mitigate water run-off and flood 
risks as components of all development that have a high 
design quality, however these requirements are further 
expanded upon by policies DES7, DES8, DES10 and EP4.

tenures; 
xiii)  respects the local context working with and 
complementing the scale, height, density, grain, 
massing, type, details of the surrounding area; 
xiv)  secures a high-quality public realm that is 
designed to support an active life for everyone 
with well managed and maintained public areas; 
xv)  does not differentiate between the design 
quality of market and affordable housing or the 
adjacent public realm; 
xvi)  is designed to take account of possible future 
development in the local area;

likelihood of crime and antisocial behaviour as well 
as the fear of crime itself; and
xix)  ensures a sufficient level of well-integrated 
and imaginative solutions for car and bicycle 
parking and external storage including bins.
2.  Where development sites are located adjacent 
to sites that have a reasonable prospect of 
coming forward in the future, integration with 
the neighbouring site should form part of the 
proposal’s design.

established in the Design and Access Statement 
and the South Oxfordshire Design Guide;...
… buildings should also be orientated within 
their plots to maximise daylight and passive solar 
gain, with garden areas orientated to maximise 
sunlight….
1. New development is required to make provision 
for the effective use and protection of natural 
resources where applicable, including:
i) the efficient use of land, with densities in 
accordance with Policy STRAT5 Residential 
Densities. Proposals which seek to deliver higher 
quality and higher density development which 
minimises land take will be encouraged;  The policy requires masterplans to demonstrate how 
active travel and public transport opportunities have been 
maximised including through the appropriate locating of 
community facilities within development.
Support for the careful siting of buildings to maximise 
passive solar gains contributes to the achievement of low 
carbon heating.
The policy is one of the key policies addressing climate 
change in the Plan.  The policy guides the efficient use of 
resources including land in accordance with Policy STRAT5, 
the minimisation of waste during construction and the life 
cycle of the building, maximising passive solar heating, 
lighting, natural ventilation, energy and water efficiency 
and the re-use of materials, consideration of air and water 
quality measures, avoidance of development of areas of

to be the most sustainable choice from reasonable 
alternatives, by first using areas of poorer quality 
land in preference to that of a higher quality; and 
viii) re-using vacant buildings and redeveloping 
previously developed land, provided the land is not 
of a high environmental value.
In South Oxfordshire, the prudent use of natural 
resources is a key element of delivering sustainable 
development as this contributes to tackling climate 
change. The Council encourages applicants to

conversions, refurbishments and extensions, 
should seek to minimise the carbon and energy 
impacts of their design and construction. Proposals 
must demonstrate that they are seeking to limit 
greenhouse emissions through location, building 
orientation, design, landscape and planting taking 
into account any nationally adopted standards 
and in accordance with Policies DES10: Carbon 
Reduction and DES7: Efficient use of Resources. 
2.  All new development should be designed to 
improve resilience to the anticipated effects of 
climate change. Proposals should incorporate 
measures that address issues of adaptation to 
climate change taking account of best practice. 
These include resilience to increasing temperatures 
and wind speeds, heavy rainfall and snowfall 
events and the need for water conservation and 
storage.

5.  A sensitive approach will need to be taken 
to conserve the special character of designated 
and non-designated heritage assets in a manner 
appropriate to their significance. 
The design and construction of new developments 
and refurbishments to existing buildings can have 
a significant role in helping to reduce carbon 
emissions, which can be supported by improving 
the energy efficiency of new and existing 
buildings. 
To improve resilience to the anticipated effects of 
climate change, the Council expects applicants 
to consider the effects of changing weather 
patterns and design new developments so that 
they incorporate measures to combat these. This 
could include planting, shading, the orientation 
and positioning of windows and advanced glazing 
systems to reduce solar heat gain in the summer 
and from lower sun angles in the winter; using 
cool building materials to prevent the penetration 
of heat and flood resilient building materials; 
increasing natural ventilation; incorporating flood 
resilient measures such as raising floor levels and 
preventing the infiltration of heavy rain around 
windows and doors. Consideration should also be 
given to using locally sourced, more sustainable 
building materials and fuel, for example, locally 
sourced wood.The supporting text highlights that actions can be taken in 
delivering new development and refurbishments to reduce 
carbon emissions.  These actions include the measures set 
out in Policies DES1, DES7, DES8 and DES10.

n/a  8.31 2061. The Council encourages schemes for renewable 
and low carbon energy generation and associated 
infrastructure at all scales including domestic 
schemes. It also encourages the incorporation of 
renewable and low carbon energy applications 
within all development. Planning applications for 
renewable and low carbon energy generation will 
be supported, provided that they do not cause a 
significantly adverse effect to:
i) landscape, both designated AONB and locally 
valued, biodiversity, including protected habitats 
and species and Conservation Target Areas;
ii) the historic environment, both designated and 
non designated assets, including development

than the 1990 baseline. To help increase the use 
of renewable and low carbon energy the Council 
will promote the use of energy from renewable 
and low carbon sources, including community-led 
initiatives, and will develop policies to maximise 
renewable and low carbon energy development 
while ensuring that adverse impacts are addressed

Statement will include details as to how the policy 
will be complied with and monitored. 
To tackle the causes of climate change and 
address the commitment of the Council to become 
a carbon neutral district by 2030 it is crucial that 
planning policy limits carbon dioxide emissions 
from new development by ensuring developments 
use less energy and assess the opportunities for 
using renewable energy technologies.
The Council has ambitious aspirations for reducing 
the district’s carbon emissions and recognises that 
more could be done to reduce emissions with 
regards to construction emissions, unregulated 
energy and reducing, capturing and storing 
embodied carbon. The Council also recognises 
that zero carbon homes are achievable for many 
residential developments now. The Council would 
encourage the delivery of zero carbon homes 
as soon as possible to avoid the need for costly 
retrofitting and would support development 
permitted by this Plan that exceeds the carbon 
reduction requirements set. The Council would The Plan encourages the reduction of energy use and 
carbon dioxide emissions. 
The Plan encourages and supports developers to do more 
to reduce carbon emissions and deliver zero carbon homes 
as soon as possible.

Policyalso encourage similar reductions in terms of 
construction emissions and would implore 
developers to consider a development’s overall 
carbon footprint and opportunities to reduce 
carbon emissions from the construction of 
infrastructure through offsetting. A request for 
a departure from this policy is expected to be 
supported by robust evidence including viability 
assessments where required and will only 
be supported exceptionally. The Council will 
monitor the effect of this policy and consider 
a review of the policy in the light of any future 
legislation and national policy in this field.
All energy efficiency measures used to 
achieve a reduction in carbon emissions, 
including renewable energy and low carbon 
technologies, should be delivered on-site, 
where possible. Where off-site renewable 
energy and low carbon technologies need to 
be used, the renewable or low carbon energy 
produced should directly service the proposed 
development scheme.
The Council encourages developers to 
take account of the energy hierarchy when 
identifying the measures taken to reduce 
carbon emissions and to adopt a fabric first 
approach by maximising the performance of 
the components and materials that make up 
the building fabric before considering the use 
of mechanical or electrical building services n/a  8.36  209
n/a  8.37  209The Plan requires carbon reductions made by renewable 
and low carbon technologies to be on-site, or where 
this is not possible, to directly service the proposed 
development scheme. This will ensure that the benefits 
in carbon reduction relate directly to the development 
and help to achieve carbon neutrality for the district. 
The Plan supports the energy hierarchy and a ‘fabric 
first’ approach in order to reduce energy usage and 
carbon emissions.

Policysystems. Consideration should also be given to 
modern methods of construction.
It is important that the carbon emissions of these 
new developments are monitored effectively 
to ensure compliance. The Energy Statement 
submitted to support the application needs to 
set out how the developer will demonstrate 
compliance with the carbon reduction 
requirements and how emissions will be monitored 
to ensure that the development continues to 
comply. Suitable accreditations can be used to 
demonstrate compliance as part of the Energy 
Statement, for example the Passivhaus standard 
or the highest BREEAM standards. However, it will 
need to be clear how the accreditation relates to 
the requirements of the policy.

main town centre uses in accordance with the 
established hierarchy of centres.
4. For our local centres, development proposals 
will be permitted that:  
i) provide retail and leisure uses within the centres 
through infill development and small scale 
redevelopment;
ii) provide small scale retail or leisure development 
that contributes to the vitality and viability of the 
villages whilst not undermining the retail roles of 
the towns;
iii) seek to improve access and movement for all 
users.
