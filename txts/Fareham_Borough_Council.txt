Foreword by the Executive Member for Planning and Development – Councillor Martin  
  
   
 
 
The Council  began reviewing the Local Plan in 2015 and  have worked hard  
since then to produce this Publication Local Plan to address the development 
needs of Fareham Borough. During this time, national policy has changed 
on many topics, but perhaps most significantly on the way housing need is 
calculated, moving from a locall y-derived calculation, to a standard 
methodology.  The preparation of a Local Plan through this changing 
landscape has presented a number of challenges and those who have 
followed the Local Plan process closely will note the many twists and turns 
between t he previous consultation documents.  
Councillor S. Martin   
  
This Publication Local Plan represents the scale of growth and appropriate spatial strategy for 
development in the Borough over the plan period, now set out to be until 2037.   In establishing 
where housing growth is most appropriate, the Local Plan builds  on the existing planning permissions 
that have been granted but the homes are not yet built, and focusses development in urban or edge 
of settlement locations, rather than greenfield sites.   In line with our vision, t he approach that has 
been taken in the  Publication Local  Plan looks to distribute development across the Borough and 
achieve maximum community benefit from that development.  
 
Alongside meeting our national targets for housing, the Local Plan proposes a level of employment 
growth required to meet our needs, and sets out where commercial development should take place.  
Recognising the recent Coronavirus pandemic, it is even more vital that our economic growth needs 
are met and job opportunities are provided.  We must also recognise the changing nature of our high 
streets and leisure needs, and this Publication Local Plan includes policies to respond positively to 
changing trends a nd preferences.  
 
This Publication Local Plan includes policies to protect and improve both the natural and historic 
environment  for both current and future generations to enjoy.  
 
It is important that this Publication  Local Plan  will be subject to a si x-week public consultation to 
allow the views of residents, businesses and other s invested in the future of Fareham to be heard 
by the Planning Inspector appointed to consider whether this plan is 'sound'.   I would therefore 
encourage  people to read the P lan and its supporting evidence documents  and make comments on 
it during the forthcoming consultation period.   Opportunities to engage in the consultation may take 
on a different form as the country continues to deal with the risk of Coronavirus but the C ouncil is 
committed to mirroring previous levels of public engagement through safe and more virtual forms of 
communication.  
  
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate how important it is that the public and other interested 
parties use the consultation process to express their views and opinions on the content of this 
Publication Local Plan,  in order to continue to help  promote a positive plan -led future for the Borough 
of Fareham .

 What is a Local Plan ? 
  
1.1 Fareham Borough Council as a Local Planning Authority is required , in line with 
Government legislation, policies and guidance, to prepare a Local Plan . The Local Plan  
contains  strategic priorities , policies and allocations which aim to achieve sustainable  
development in the Borough  whilst also identifying and protecting its valued assets . The 
Local Plan sets out what the Council  considers are the opportunities for development as 
well as clear policies on what will or what will not be permitted and where.  The plan aims 
to ensure beneficial and high -quality development to meet the future  needs of its residents, 
workers and visitor s, whilst protecting its most valued natural and man -made assets such 
as landscapes, settlement character, heritage and community buildings. The new Local 
Plan will follow the priorities outlined in the Council’s Corporate Strategy1. 
  
1.2 The Fareham Local Plan 203 7, when adopted:  
• Sets the strategic planning policies for the Borough, taking account of key factors 
such as population and economic growth, climate change  and environmental 
character;  
• Sets the general scale and distribution of new de velopment which is required to 
meet Fareham’s needs to 203 7 and contributes to  local unmet need in accordance 
with duty to cooperate requirements;  
• Provide s the planning principles, including detailed development management 
policies to guide  decisions on planning applications;  
• Identifies  where new residential and economic development will be located through 
allocations of land; and  
• Identifies  key environmenta l designations and include s specific proposals for the 
conservation and enhancement of natural and historic landscapes and assets.  
  
1.3 Planning law2 states that planning applications should be determined in accordance with 
the Local Plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise and therefore the policies 
within the Fareham Local Plan, together with any future neighbourhood plans, will be the 
framework against which any planning applications will be assessed.  
  
 The purpose of this document  
  
1.4 This document, the Publication Plan (Regulation 19), represents the ‘Publication’ stage of 
the Local Plan process. It is the result of updating and merging the Regulation 18 Draft 
Local Plan and Supplement taking into account the changes to national policy  and 
guidance as well as comments received during the consultation exercises, including advice 
on wording from statutory bodies. This is the final stage before the Local Plan is submitted 
to the Secretary of State for independent examination.  
  
1.5 This is a formal, statutory stage in the production of the Local Plan, as set out in the Town 
and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012. The Regulations 
specify  that this stage of the plan is subject to a six -week period of consultat ion. The 
representations made to the consultation must focus on the ‘Tests of Soundness’ which 
require that the Local Plan has been ‘ positively prepared, justified, effective and 
consistent with national policy ’:

1.6 To be ‘p ositively prepared’ the Local Plan must:  
• Provide a strategy which, as a minimum, seeks to meet the area’s objectively 
assessed needs; and  
• Be informed by agreements with other authorities, so that unmet need from 
neighbouring areas is accommodated where it is practic al to do so; and  
• Be consistent with achieving sustainable development.  
 
 To be ‘j ustified’, the Local Plan must:  
• Provide an appropriate strategy, taking into account the reasonable alternatives; 
and 
• Be based on proportionate evidence.  
 
 To be ‘e ffective’, the Local Plan must:  
• Be deliverable over the plan period; and  
• Be based on effective joint working on cross -boundary strategic matters.  
 
 To be ‘c onsistent with national policy’, the Local Plan must:  
• Enable the delivery of sustainable development in accordance with the NPPF.  
  
1.7 Following this stage, there will be a period of collation of the representations received , 
during which the Council will identify the key issues raised and consider whether any 
modifications are required to accompany the submission to the Secretary of State for 
Independent Examination. An Independent Planning Inspector will be appointed to 
cons ider the soundness of the Local Plan at an ‘Examination in Public’. The Inspector may 
suggest modifications to the Local Plan and, once found ‘sound’, the Council will seek to 
adopt the Local Plan.  
  
1.8 In line with Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, the starting 
point for determining planning applications is the Development Plan (i.e. the Local Plan, 
the Minerals and Waste Plan and any Neighbourhood plans), unless material 
considerations3 indicate otherwise.   This means  that all policies relevant to the application 
within the Local Plan need to be considered.   
  
1.9 In drafting these policies, the Council has avoided duplication where possible to achieve 
better worded and more succinct policies.  There is some  cross referencing between 
policies, and the supporting  text to some policies will indicate other matters covered 
elsewhere in the plan that need to be considered.   However, the need to consider all other 
relevant policies cannot be avoided just because the most relevant polic y does not refer to 
an issue.  Thi s will be a common requirement for topics such as parking, design and the 
need to provide planning obligations .  In all instances the Local Plan 2037 should be read 
as a whole.  
  
 Fareham’s Local Plan History to Date  
  
1.10 All local authorities are required to have an up to date Local Plan. T he Council committed 
to reviewing the Local Plan in 2015 , following the adoption of Fareham's Local Plan parts 
 
3 Material considerations can include (but are not limited to) previous planning decisions (in cluding appeal decisions) and 
government policy, including the NPPF.   
3 
 
2 and 3 . In October 2017, the Council began a Regulation 18 consultation4 on the Draft 
Local Plan. Th is consultation plan outlined the vision and strategic priorities for the 
Borough, in line with the Council’s Corporate Strategy. The consultation on the draft plan 
ran until 8 December 2017 and resulted in over 2,500 responses from ind ividuals and 
organisations. The Draft Local Plan sought, amongst other aims, to address the Borough’s 
objectively assessed housing need (OAN) as identified in the Partnership for South 
Hampshire’s ( PUSH, now PfSH) Strategic Housing Market Assessment ( SHMA ) Update 
(published in April 2016).  
  
1.11 At the same time as the Council were consulting on the Draft Local Plan, the Government 
undertook a consultation called 'Planning for the right homes in the right places' which 
proposed changes to the  National Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF ), including a new 
method for calculating housing need using a ‘standard methodology’. The standard 
methodology calculates how many homes are needed by taking into account household 
projections based on house prices  compared to local salaries.  
  
1.12 The Government confirmed the implementation of the standard methodology in July 2018, 
resulting in a higher housing need for Fareham. The Draft Local Plan which the Council 
had consulted on in 2017 , would not meet the new requirement and so the Council has 
had to revisit this work in order to meet the new identified housing target .  
  
1.13 The Council commenced a review of the Draft Local Plan to address the increase in 
housing requirement and to ensure that the policies complied with the revised NPPF. In 
the summer of 2019, the Council undertook an Issues and Options consultation , to ask 
people where, in their opinion, development should go and where in the Borough should 
be protected from future development. T he feedback from  the Issues and Options 
consultation informed the preparation of the Supplement to the Fareham Local Plan , which 
was in turn the subject of a Regulation 18 consultation  in January and February 2020.  The 
results of these  three  consultations  combined  have informed the preparation of the 
Publication Plan.  
  
1.14 In August 2020 the Government published a new planning consultation  which propose ds 
further changes to the way housing need is calculated . The proposed new formula 
continue ds to take into account household projections  as set out in the current standard 
methodology  but willto also consider a Local Authority’s existing housing stock. This 
change to methodology would have mean t that Fareham’s identified housing need wouldill 
decrease from that identified in 2018 . This has led to the re -evaluation of the scale of 
housing growth required for the Local Plan and prompted a review of potential housing 
allocations in line with the preferred residential development strategy of focusing 
development on deliverable urban and sustainable edge of settlement  sites, resulting in 
the proposed allocations  in the Housing Need and Supply chapter  (chapter 4) . The 
resulting Publication Local Plan, based on this methodology was subject to  Regulation 19 
consultation  in November and December 2020 . 
  
1.14.1 In late December 2020 the Government released its response to the consu ltation  in which 
they stated they did not propose to proceed with the changes to the formula for calculating 
housing need, instead retaining the existing formula  along with applying  an upl ift to major 
UK cities . Their reasoning included a  commitment  to delivering 300,000 homes per year 
by the mid 2020 ’s and that the distribution of need under the proposed methodology placed 
 
4 Regulation 18  of the Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) Regulations  2012 requires that various bodies and 
stakeholders be notified that the council is preparing a plan. It invit es them to comment about what that plan ought to 
contain. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/767/regulation/18/made

too much strain on rural areas and not enough focus on towns and cities. In addition they 
identified the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on towns and  cities leading to reduced 
demand for retail and commercial spaces  stating that they want “towns and cit ies to emerge 
from the pandemic renewed and strengthened …with greater public and private investment 
in urban housing and  regeneration ”5. The result of th eir decision  is that  Fareham ’s housing 
need  has reverted to the previously identified higher level, requiring the Council to  
undertake a further review of housing allocations to ensure the plan would meet the need. 
The resulting new housing allocations, together with any revisions informed by  the 
Regulation 19 consultation undertaken in 2020  have led to the revised Publication  Local  
Plan.  Changes since the first Publication Local Plan a re clearly marked throughout  this 
document and are the focus of the consultation running from June 2021.  
  
 What period  of time  will the Fareham Local Plan 2037 cover?  
  
1.15 The NPPF requires that strategic policies should look ahead over a  minimum of fifteen 
years. The Fareham Local Plan proposed plan period will cover  sixteen years this minimum 
period  from the date of adoption, which is anticipated to take place in 202 21, to 2037. This 
period differs from that stated in earlier drafts (2020 to 2036) and has been reflect ed in the 
plan name which has changed from Fareham Local Plan 2036 to Fareham Local Plan 
2037.  
  
 What will the Fareham Local Plan 203 7 replace?  
  
1.16 At adoption the new Local Plan will formally replace the existing Local Plan Part 1: Core 
Strategy (2011) and Local Plan Part 2: Development Sites and Policies (2015).  The Local 
Plan 203 7 will supersede  all policies contained in the Local Plan Parts 1 and 2 .  A list of 
superseded  policies is available at Appendix A in line with  Regulation 8 (5) of the Town 
and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 . Local Plan Part 3: 
The Welborne Plan will not be replaced by the 203 7 plan, but together with the new Local 
Plan and any Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) , will make up the suite of 
planning policies upon which planning applications will be considered.   
  
1.17 In preparing the Fareham Local Plan 203 7, evaluation of the adopted Local Plan Part 3: 
The Welborne Plan was undertaken . The plan was assessed in line with the progress of 
the planning application for Welborne and was found to be  fit for purpose . Therefore , no 
review of the Welborne Plan has been undertaken  at this stage . 
  
1.18 Whilst the Welborne Plan itself is not being reviewed,  it is important to consider  the 
contribution that Welborne is expected to make in relation to the overall need within the 
Borough until 203 7, through the expected housing and employment delivery trajectories 
and the associated infrastructure.  Further information relating to Welborn e's delivery  can 
be found in:  
• Table 4.2 - Housing Requirement and Sources of Supply 202 1-2037 
• Table 6.3 – Employment  Sites to meet the Requirement . 
  
1.19 For clarity, this Plan is reviewing Part 1 and Part 2 of the Adopted Local Plan.  This is 
illustrated by the following figure :

 Preparation of the Local Plan  
  
1.20 The Publication Plan is the Council’s ‘preferred approach’ to development in the Borough 
for the period up to 203 7 and has emerged from testing a number of different options for 
development to meet objectively assessed needs.  
  
1.21 The Council commenced  a series of ‘call for sites’ exercise s preceding the 2017 Draft Local 
Plan and 2020 Supplement .  These establish what land could  be available for development 
in the future.  In terms of new homes  and employment sites , the Council assessed the 
suitability , availability  and achievability of these sites for accommodating the Borough's 
housing and employment needs . A number of sites were discounted as part of this process  
(which is detailed in the Strategic Housing and Employment Land Availability Assessment 
(SHELAA)) when they were not considered suitable, available or achievable.  
  
1.22 The likely environmental, social and econo mic effects of the local plan and the sites 
identified for development are  assessed through  the Habitats Regulation Assessment  and 
the Sustainability Appraisal incorporating Strategic Environmental Assessment .  
  
1.23 A Habitat Regulations Assessment (HRA) Screening Report  identified  the Local Plan’s 
potential i mpact on European protected  sites and the subsequent  HRA Appropriate 
Assessment  informed the preparation of the plan.  
  
1.24 The Sustainability A ppraisal /Strategic Environmental Assessment  (SA/SEA ) process was  
undertaken and amended iteratively during plan preparation. The SA /SEA  assessed 
individual sites, proposed policies and a number of different delivery options  to address 
the overall housing need .  
  
1.25 The Equalities Impact Assessment  (EqIA) assesses the policies in the Local Plan against 
protected characteristics identified in the Equalities Act 2010. The EqIA was undertaken 
iteratively through the Local Plan preparation and concludes that the policies and resulting 
development patterns of th e Local Plan are likely to have some positive and neutral effects 
on the protected characteristics identified.

Assessment and a Strategic Transport Assessment , as well as a number of other borough -
wide studies and background papers.  In some instances, the evidence has be en prepared 
by the Council and in other instances it has been prepared with partners, statutory bodies 
and/or used specialist consultants.  This evidence base provides an understanding of t he 
key issues affecting the Borough  and the Publication Plan has bee n prepared to reflect and 
respond to these issues.  
  
1.27 All these evidence base documents are available on the Council’s website. Together they 
have informed the plan’s preferred ‘development strategy’ . Further information to explain 
the approach to th e development strategy is available in Chapter 3 (Development 
Strategy).  
  
 Duty to Cooperate  
  
1.28 A 'Duty to Cooperate' was introduced through the 2011 Localism Act and is incorporated 
into the NPPF which  sets out that local planning authorities ‘are under a duty to cooperate 
with each other, and with other prescribed bodies, on strategic matters that cross 
administrative boundaries.’  Local planning authorities must demonstrate how they have 
complied with the duty to cooperate which requires the Council to:  
• Work with neighbouring authorities on a joint approach to sustainable development 
or use of land, where there would be a significant impact on the planning areas 
concerned; and 
• Work with a range of publi c bodies to set out agreements on how strategic issues 
will be dealt with through the preparation of plans; and  
• Set out planning policies to address such issues.  
  
1.29 The Council has worked closely with a number of bodies during the preparation of the 
Local Plan, in accordance with the duty to cooperate and this is recorded in the Statement 
of Compliance with the Duty to Cooperate . This is a written record which highlig hts issues 
and agreements on cross boundary strategic issues with neighbouring planning authorities 
and other relevant organisations.  In the run up to examination, the Council will progress 
the duty to cooperate work through the production of statements of  common ground which 
highlight agreement on cross boundary strategic issues with neighbouring authorities and 
other relevant organisations.  
  
 Partnership for South Hampshire  
  
1.30 The Council, along with its neighbouring authorities forms part of the Partnership for South 
Hampshire (P fSH), which seeks to encourage sustainable, economic led growth and 
regeneration of the sub -region.  The Publication Plan takes account of a number of wider 
issues and opportunities affecting the PfSH sub region and PfSH strategies are referenced 
as relevant in th e Publication  Plan although these are non -statutory and therefore can only 
inform decision making . 
  
1.31 PfSH is working on a new Statement of Common Ground between all constituent 
authorities which will effectively supersede  the Spatial Position Statement from June 2016. 
The new Statement will be informed by a variety of workstreams currently in preparation,  
including seeking to address unmet need in the sub -region through an analysis of Strategic 
Development Opportunity Areas (SDOAs), a Transport Assessment of potential SDOAs, 
and an economic analysis.  These workstreams are at different stages of preparatio n, but 
importantly this Publication Plan runs alongside the work on SDOAs.  As a partner within 
PfSH, the Council is aware of the potential sites being assessed and how this mirrors the 
Council’s own assessment of potential development opportunities throug h the Local Plan  
7 
 
SA and SHELAA.  Therefore, it is confident that there is no risk to developing the 
Publication Plan parallel to the sub -regional work, in fact it is evidence of the Council’s 
proactive approach to addressing unmet need already identified i n the PfSH area6. 
  
 Neighbourhood Planning  
  
1.32 The Local Plan 2037 will provide a strategic evidence base for Neighbourhood Plans and 
any Neighbourhood Development Orders, including Community Right to Build Orders.  
  
1.33 Any Neighbourhood Plans in Fareham Borough will need to conform with the policies of 
the Development Plan that are applicable to the Neighbourhood Area. Neighbourhood 
Plans and Development Orders will have the opportunity to take forward some of the issues  
highlighted within the Local Plan in more detail.  
  
1.34 The Council has a duty to support Neighbourhood Forums engaged in neighbourhood 
planning. The position on progress of Neighbourhood Plans will change during the life of 
the Local Plan and details of the up to date position of forums and  plans can be found on 
the Council 's website.  
  
 Strategic Policies  
  
1.35 The NPPF requires that the Local Plan includes strategic policies to address the priorities 
for the development and use of land in the Borough. The Fareham Local Plan Strategic 
Policies are identified throughout the plan and for ease are listed below:  
  
 • DS1 - Development in the Countryside  
• DS2 - Development in Strategic Gaps  
• DS3 - Landscape  
• H1 - Housing Provision

1.36 There are a number of policies in the plan which will apply across the entire Borough. For 
clarity  these are listed below:  
 
 • DS3 - Landscape  
• H1 - Housing Provision  
• HP2 - New Small -scale Development Outside Defined Urban Areas  
• HP3 - Change of Use to Garden Land

 What is the Status of the Local Plan  at this Publication Stage ?  
  
1.37 The NPPF sets out that decision -takers may give weight to relevant policies in emerging 
plans according to their stage of preparation, the extent to which there are unresolved 
objections to relevant policies, and their degree of consistency with policies in the National 
Planning  Policy Framework (NPPF).  Simply put, as the plan advances, objections are 
resolved and consistency with national policy is established , the plan will gain weight for 
decision -makers in determining applications.  
  
 Next Steps - Timetable  
  
1.38 The timetable for the preparation of the Fareham Local Plan 203 7 is set out in the Local 
Development Scheme (LDS)  which was adopted in September June  20210. The remaining

 Borough Profile  
  
1.39 The following Borough Profile provides the context for the Fareham Local Plan 203 7. 
  
 Location and Strategic Context  
  
1.40 The Borough is approximately 30 square miles in size. It adjoins the eastern boundary of 
Eastleigh, the southern boundary of Winchester and the western boundaries of Gosport 
and Portsmouth. The main town in the Borough is Fareham. The other main settlements 
are Western Wards, Portchester, Lower Swanwick, Whiteley, Stubbington and Hill Head, 
Funtley and Titchfield. In addition, land has been identi fied for a new community at 
Welborne, including the provision of 6,000 new homes.  
  
1.41 Much of the Borough is countryside, providing a rich and varied pattern of landscape with 
well-established visual and physical separation between settlements, ensuri ng a sense of 
place and reinforcing local distinctiveness. These varied landscapes provide space for 
nature and biodiversity as well as leisure and recreation opportunities for people in the 
Borough, contributing to the quality of life and health of local residents.  
   
10 
 
 
 
 Figure 1.2: Location of Fareham Borough  
  
 Housing Needs and Infrastructure  
  
1.42 The Borough has a population of approximately 117,000 living in 46,000  households7. 
There is an acknowledged housing need, and affordability is an issue for first time buyers 
and households on low incomes who cannot access home ownership. To the year endin g 
2019, the m edian house prices in Fareham were  estimated to be £288,5008. Eviden ce also 
now indicates that the Borough has an ageing population and there is a need to address 
this, particularly through adaptable housing.  
  
1.43 The Borough is well connected to the M27 motorway, which is located in the north of the 
Borough and provides access to Southampton, Portsmouth and the rest of Hampshire. 
However, the M27 does suffer from congestion, particularly at peak times. The Borough 
has three train stations, providing connections to London and to the wider rail network.  
  
 Economy, Employment and Skills  
  
1.44 Fareham has a strong economy with a good balance of businesses with approximately 
57,700 of the Borough’s residents in work. This equates to approximately 81% of the 
Borough’s population being in employment9. The Solent Enterprise Zone at Daedalus 
contain s a significant amount of the Borough’s employment floorspace, including the 
Innovation Centre and the Faraday and Swordfish business parks that will help to provide 
future jobs for local residents. Fareham also has a skilled workforce with approximately

61% of all 16  to 64-year olds in the Borough being educated to college level and above, 
higher than the overall percentage for Great Britain of 58%10.  
  
 Environment  
  
1.45 Natural Environment: The Borough’s natural environment is highly valued by residents and 
visitors. The value is reflected in the Borough’s areas of special landscape quality, three 
main rivers, the woodlands and parks, six Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), six 
Nature Reserves and the coastline.  The Borough’s coastal location results in some areas 
being affected by tidal flooding.  In response to this, the Eastern Solent Coastal Partnership 
(ESCP) was formed in 2012 to deliver a series of coastal management services across the 
coastline, including Fareham Borough, with  the overarching aim to reduce coastal flooding 
and erosion.  
  
1.46 Historic Environment: The Borough benefits from a number of designated and non -
designated heritage assets which contribute to the built character. The Borough’s historic 
environment includes 5 Scheduled Monuments, 13 Conservation Areas, more than 400 
statutory Listed Buildings, 200 locally listed buildings , 8 historic parks and gardens which 
have been identified as having local importance  and a number of archaeological sites of 
local impo rtance.  
  
 Retail and Leisure  
  
1.47 High streets nationally have all been affected by the changing trend in people’s shopping 
habits to purchasing online and Fareham Town Centre is no exception. With a reduction in 
footfall to traditional shops, increasingly, high streets are seeking alternative uses such as 
housing and entertainment and relaxation venues. The Fareham Town Centre and 
Portchester District Centre vision documents11 recognise there is room for improvement 
and explore a number of oppo rtunities for additional development, including the provision 
of further good quality homes and adapting the range of retail uses to meet the changing 
needs of the population.  
  
1.48 Residents and visitors have access to a wide range of community and leisure facilities 
around the Borough, such as the Westbury Manor Museum, Ashcroft Arts Centre, and the 
Holly Hill Leisure Centre which opened in 2016. The availability of such facilities is a benefit 
to the Borough’s residents and the Counci l is looking to improve the range of facilities on 
offer, with a focus on Fareham Town Centre and the redevelopment of Ferneham Hall.

 Vision  
   
2.1 In order to provide a focus for the Local Plan, from which the Strategic Priorities and 
other elements of policy will follow, we need to be clear about the sort of place we wa nt 
Fareham Borough to be in 2037  and consider how we  will achieve this.  
  
2.2 The Council’s Corporate Strategy (2017 – 2023) was approved by the Council  in 
December 2017, and reviewed in December 2019 . The main theme of the strategy is a 
vision of Fareham as a prosperous, safe and attractive place to live and work, with a 
future categorised by increasing prosperity, providing new homes for our growing 
communities, and making the Borough an even more 
inclusive and attractive place to live and work.  Particular 
consideration has been given to the six Corporate 
Priorities:  
 
• Providing Housing Choices  
• Protect and Enhance the Environment  
• Strong, Safe and Inclusive Communities  
• Maintain and Extend Prosperity  
• Leisure Opportunities for Health and Fun  
• Dynamic, Prudent and Progressive Council  
 
  
2.3 These Corporate Priorities have been used to inform the Local Plan 2037  Vision and 
Strategic Policies included in this Publication  Plan.  
  
2.4 The Local Plan can help deliver housing choices by providing new homes, sites for new 
jobs, new schools and new leisure facilities  by planning for development to 2037 .  The 
Local Plan contributes to protecting and enhancing the environment by recognising the 
importance of la nd designated for nature conservation purposes, providing open space 
as part of new developments and continuing to protect existing areas of open space.  
This is in addition to policies requiring water efficiency measures in new homes and 
ensuring the land  susceptible to flooding is retained as part of a functioning floodplain .  
  
2.5 The Local Plan assists with engendering a feeling of safety and security in our everyday 
activities by ensuring places are well -designed for activity both during the day and night.  
Proposed growth within Local Plans must be assessed in terms of the impact s on 
highways and how people use walking and cycling routes,  and needs to demonstrate 
that any new growth on our road network is designed with safety in mind.  
  
2.6 The Local Plan contributes to maintaining and extending prosperity by allocating land fo r 
economic growth that will provide jobs for local people and support the local economy.  
Its policies also assist in promoting attractive and vibrant district and town centres, and 
supporting and protecting, where possible, existing businesses.  Alongside  the Corporate 
Strategy, the Council has approved two vision documents relating specifically to the 
regeneration and redevelopment of Fareham Town Centre and Portchester District 
Centre.   
   
13 
 
2.7 The fifth priority relates to leisure opportunities and ensuring that Fareham continues to 
be an attractive place to live.  The Local Plan contributes to this primarily through the 
provision of open space within the Borough , sports provision and  play areas on or near 
to new developments.  
  
2.8 The Local Plan also contributes to the Corporate Strategy priority of the Council 
continuing to be dynamic, prudent and progressive.  Working with developers to collect 
financial contributions from new developments to support the provision of infrastru cture, 
including those types provided directly by the Council, necessary for the planned growth.  
  
2.9 The Local Plan provides an opportunity to focus the Corporate Strategy priorities more 
specifically to sustainable planning and the built environment,  and to achieve an 
appropriate balance between economic, social and environmental factors in order to 
meet the needs of the Borough. The Vision for the Local Plan will also address a longer 
period of time than the Corporate Strategy, extending until 2037  (i.e. the end of the plan 
period) as opposed to 2023.  
  
2.10 Fareham Local Plan 2037  Vision  
 
Fareham Borough will offer a high quality of life to all residents and be an attractive, 
safe and pleasant place to live, work and visit. It will be a sustainable and increasingly 
prosperous  place , with low levels of crime and unemployment and good access to 
community facilities, jobs, leisure, shops, open space and services.  
 
The Borough will accommodate development to address the need for new homes and 
employment space  in Fareham Borough.  The new housing will address  the particular 
needs in the Borough , such as  our growing housing need and an ageing population 
and creating  attractive places to live.  
 
New employment space will be located in  the most appropriate locations that are 
attractive to the market  and acceptable in terms of environment impact. Existing 
employment areas and zones will be supported and all decisions made will seek a 
sustainable future for t he employment provision in the  Borough and its associated 
jobs.  
 
Fareham Borough will retain its identity, and the identity of individual  settlements 
within the B orough, through measures that seek to retain the valued landscapes and 
settlement definition.  
 
The natural, built  and histo ric assets of the B orough will continue to be protected , 
alongside the Borough’s many valued open spaces, sports provision and leisure and 
community facilities . 
 
Fareham Borough will have a strong and diverse economy with improved levels of 
self-containmen t with people working from home  or close to home , with opportunities 
for public transport use and other sustainable travel choices maximised.  
 
Fareham  Town Centre and other retail areas will be retained and regeneration 
opportunities that support the town and district centres  will be encouraged , whilst 
making efficient use of any developable land is these locations . 
 
Significant road improvements will take place, such as  changes at Junction 10 on the   
  
14 
 
M27, and the Stubbington bypass, which will relieve traffic congestion issues. 
Wherever possible other highway works will be undertaken to support development 
and minimise the impacts to our highway network and those that use it.  
  
 Strategic Priorities  
  
2.11 There are a number of strategic priorities that can be drawn from the Fareham Local 
Plan Vision  2037 . These provide the focus in formulating the Local Plan and its policies.   
  
2.12  Strategic Priorities  
 
 1. Address the housing and employment needs by the end of the plan period in an 
appropriate and sustainable  manner, creating places people want to live or  where 
businesses want to locate.  
 
 2. In the first instance maximise  development within the urban area and away from the 
wider countryside, valued landscapes and spaces that contribute to settlement 
definition . 
 
 3. Ensure high quality design that responds to local character  and provides 
opportunities for healthy, fulfilling and active lifestyles is integral to all development 
proposals in the Borough . 
 
 4. Ensure that infrastructure is planned prior to development , and delivered at the 
appropriate points alongside development , to meet the changing needs of our 
residents and businesses . 
 
 5. Provide a sustainable and vibrant  future for Fareham Town Centre , district centres 
and other retail areas , maintain ing and improving their vitality and viability.  
 
 6. Provide a mix of jobs and employment opportunities through protecting and further 
enhancing viable and important employment areas and zones, and providing for the 
future employment floorspace.  
 
 7. Create places that  encourage healthy lifestyles  and provide for the community  
through  the provision of leisure and cultural facilities, recreation and open space 
and the opportunity to walk and cycle to destinations . 
 
 8. Provide new housing which incorporates a mix of tenure, size and type to meet the 
Borough’s needs and enable accommodation for all, this includes address ing the  
specific needs of different groups in the community, including the elderly and people 
with disabilities . 
 
 9. Protect and enhance the Borough’s  landscape features, valued landscape s, 
biodiversity , green infrastructure networks  and the local, national and international 
sites designated for nature conservation . 
 
 10. Appropriately manage , protect  and enhance  the Borough’s  historic  environment 
historical assets including Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings and Scheduled 
Ancient Monuments.  
 
   
15 
 
 11. Ensure the Borough responds to predictions of climate change, particularly in 
relation to the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.  
 
 12. Create opportunities for modal shift to public transport and more active travel  
modes such as walking and cycling.  
 
  
2.13 There are other delivery mechanisms and enablers outside of the direct scope of the 
Local Plan which will also contribute to the Corporate Vision and the Fareham Local Plan 
2037  Vision. This includes documents such as the Council’s Housing Strategy  and 
Leisure and Cultural Strategy . Other relevant documents are included in the review of 
policies, plans, and programmes contained in the accompanying Sustainability 
Appraisal /Strategic Environmental Assessment (SA/SEA)  to this plan.

    Overview   
  
3.1 The Local Plan 2037  sets the Development  Strategy for the Borough taking into account 
housing and employment needs for Fareham Borough up until 2037 .  In order to provide 
certainty to planning applicants, residents and business owners within the Borough, as 
well as key partners and stakeholders, one of the fundamental roles of a Local Plan is to 
define the area’s Development Strategy for the duration of the plan period.  A 
Development Strategy in dicates the scale of development likely and necessary to come 
forward, as well  as how that scale of growth is to be located across the Borough.    
  
3.2 The Local Plan  provide s a Development  Strategy for the distribution, scale and form of 
development and supporting infras tructure, a set of proposals to deliver the strategy, 
policies against which to assess planning applications, and proposals for monitoring the 
success of the plan.  
  
3.3 The strategy therefore defines where development is  deemed acceptable in principle for 
development, as well as where  it is not.  Being clear about the strategy provides clarity 
to all who have an interest in the future of the Borough.   
  
 Good Growth  
  
3.4 At the heart of the Development Strategy proposed for Fareham is the concept of good 
growth. Good growth means building homes and creating employment spaces in such a 
way as to improve quality of life whilst protecting the most valued natural and historic 
environments. Developments need to respect environmental protections and deliver 
opportunities for environmental gain, provid e opportunities for reduced energy demand 
and waste production, whilst sensitively managing the countryside and valued 
landscapes.   Good growth also means providing open space and leisure opportunities 
to encourage healthy and active lifestyles and encouraging more of us to use active 
forms of travel rather than the car.  
  
3.5 The Council has considered the most appropriate Development Strategy for the 
Borough, with options for ‘good growth’ areas being tested through the earlier Issues and 
Options consultation which took place in the summer of 2019 and the Sustainability 
Apprai sal process.  The Supplement consultation in early 2020  identified the Council’s 
preferred approach to its Development Strategy which it proposes to use to guide the 
focus of development until at least 2037 . 
  
 Development Strategy  
  
3.6 The important factors that have helped shape the spatial expression of the development 
strategy are listed below;  
• Landscape and countryside  
• Settlement boundaries and the desire  to respect settlement identity  
• Climate change, flood zones and coastal management a reas 
• Protected areas for nature conservation and recreational purposes  
• Transport corridors and opportunit ies to encourage more active travel modes  
• Need to encourage diversity in the housing market ( by encouraging a mix of small , 
medium  and larger  sites)  
• Sustainability and accessibility to services   
18 
  • The requirement to meet our housing and employment need.  
  
3.7 These factors, presented  on the key diagram in figure 3.1, reflect the definition of 
sustainable development in the NPPF, alongside other key national drivers as well as 
responding to the comments received on previous public consultations. For example, 
landscape and the value that residents give to certain lan dscapes in the Borough was a 
feature of the Issues and Options consultation in 2019.  
  
3.8 The Borough of Fareham has a remarkably complex landscape for its size.  The 
landscape is one that is balanced between mixed rural valleys, coastal plain, farmland  
and woodland and extensive built -up areas, as well as the M27 motorway and railway 
lines which cross the Borough. One of the core principles of national planning p olicy is 
that planning should recognise the intrinsic character and beauty of the countrysid e.   
  
3.9 Recent planning appeal decisions in the Borough have highlighted the need to consider 
the designation of valued landscapes as part of the Local Plan.  Previous Local Plans 
have included the demarcation of ‘Areas of Special Landscape Quality’ in the Borough 
which were used to help shape planning s trategy and decisions on planning applications.  
These areas were  the Meon, Hamble and Hook valleys, Portsdown Hill and the Forest 
of Bere. Both t he Landscape Assessment (2017 ), and the more recent ‘ Technical Review 
of Areas of Special Landscape Quality an d the Strategic Gaps ’ (2020)  still recognise the 
intrinsic character and distinctiveness of these relatively undeveloped areas of the 
Borough and so their locations have been used to shape the development strategy.  
There is a presumption against major development in these areas, unless it can be 
demonstrated through a landscape assessment that the quality and distinctiveness of 
the lands cape character can be conserved.  For these reasons there remain  no 
development allocations in these areas.  
  
3.10 The need to respect settlement boundaries and protect the identity of our key settlements 
has been a strong influence on planning decisions  to date.  Two strategic gaps have long 
been established  in the Borough;  one in the Meon valley and the other between the 
settlements of Fareham and Stubbington.  Strategic gaps have been  retained but  they 
have been  re-defined in the Publication  Plan to fo cus on preventing settlement 
coalescence. For this reason, it was  necessary to undertake  a careful review  to ensure 
that the strategic gap performs the function of supporting the r etention of settlement 
identity .  Independent evidence was commissioned to s upport this review, ‘Technical 
Review of Areas of Special Landscape Quality and the Strategic Gaps’ , which is 
available alongside the Publication Plan.  Again, this policy direction has been driven as 
a response to the NPPF and recent planning appeals wher e the function, and strength 
of, the strategic gaps were called into question.  
  
3.11 Another key influencing factor on the revised Development Strategy is climate change.  
This is an issue that has helped shape national planning policy in recent decades and 
the process of plan preparation is acknowledged as having an important role in shaping 
how our future land use responds to this challenging phenomenon and the need to 
mitigate its impacts.  Two of the most influential elements of climate change  in terms of 
shaping a development strategy is the need to respect Coastal Change Management 
Areas and areas prone to severe flood risk.  For this reason, both of these factors have 
influenced the proposed spatial strategy for development and major develop ment is not 
proposed in areas identified as having a role in mitigating the impacts of flooding or 
coastal erosion.   
19 
    
3.12 Allied with this is the need to protect and enhance  areas designated for nature 
conservation interest, both in terms of the intrinsic interest of the site in question and its 
role in a wider ecological network.  Recognising the important role that green 
infrastructure has on the physical and mental wellbei ng of our residents and visitors, 
areas designated as open space or protected for recreational purposes are also areas 
that will continue to support those functions in the long term within this proposed 
development strategy.   
  
3.13 Recognising that good growth enables greater choices in terms of how our residents, 
employees and visitors travel, the existing and proposed transport corridors have 
influenced the revised development strategy.  All areas of the Borough  have their 
particul ar merits and disbenefits in terms of how people living or working within them 
would choose to travel , and through undertaking the Transport Assessment, the impacts 
of the Local Plan growth on the highways network is understood (see Chapter 10, 
Transport a nd other Infrastructure) .  Future potential transport opportunities that may be 
secured through significant investment, such as Rapid Transit services need to be 
considered alongside the development strategy as well as ensuring that access to the 
existing road network is provided to any development site.  
  
3.14 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) recognises the need to ensure that 
there is diversity within the housing market and acknowledges the role that small to 
medium sites (of less than one hectare) can bring to any development strategy both in 
terms of ensuring a supply of deliverable sites that can be relied upon within the first few 
years of a Local Plan and the fact that small sites help to diversify the housing product, 
such as by encouraging people who wish to build their own homes.  For this r eason, the 
proposed Development Strategy provides a new policy tool to allow small -scale 
development in the countryside where it can be demonstrated that the location is 
sustainable in terms of access to local facilities and services, and that the developm ent 
would be in keeping with the character and pattern of the existing settlement.  While the 
policy applies to the whole Borough , its specific wording means that it can only be applied 
in certain areas where particular criteria are met.  The new policy ca n be viewed in full 
in the housing chapter (Chapter 5) and will be subject to regular monitoring to ensure 
that it is achieving the desired effect.   
  
3.15 That said, the need to find sustainable locations for development that are accessible to 
local fa cilities and services runs throughout the Local Plan and the revised Development 
Strategy.  Each growth scenario, each potential development area and then each site 
considered for development has been assessed against the sustainability objectives set 
by the Council in the Sustainability Appraisal.  
  
3.16 The final important factor that has influenced this proposed Development Strategy is the 
need to find sufficient suitable, available and achievable sites in order to meet the 
housing  and employment  need and to provide certainty to residents and businesses that 
the Council is working within a plan -led system for development that should not be 
undermined by speculative, unsuitable and unsustainable development.  To do this, the 
Council needs to meet the requirements of the NPPF in terms of housing numbers and 
employment floorspace, and provide sufficient contingency  within those numbers to 
avoid losing control of development management should sites fail to deliver as expected.   
   
20 
  3.17 The Council has an obligation to work with neighbouring authorities in order to identify 
and address unmet need within the region.  This work is being undertaken through the 
Partnership for South Hampshire (PfSH), of which the Council is a member .  PfSH are 
working on a Statement of Common Ground to identify Strategic Development 
Opportunity Areas (SDOAs) that could be selected to address the identified unmet need 
in the sub -region.   This work  is likely to continue into 2021  and the Council will rem ain 
an active partner in discussions.  However, the Council considers it unnecessary to wait 
for the outcome of the PfSH work in relation to the question of Fareham’s contribution to 
unmet need due to two main reasons.  First, as has been mentioned the Council is a 
member of PfSH and as such is party to the discussions and technical assessment 
undertaken on poten tial SDOAs within the Borough.   Second, the Council has 
undertaken bilateral conversations with neighbouring authorities through the Duty to Co -
operate obligation and is aware  of the unmet need  arising  there  and the Borough’s 
capacity to address any unmet need.  
  
3.18 This Development Strategy has been used to determine the suitability of proposed sites 
for development, alongside a wide range of other factors that are more appropriate at a 
more localised level such as the need to protect and enhance the historic environ ment, 
ecological issues and factors related to environmental health. More on how we have 
defined sites that are suitable, available and achievable within the lifespan of the plan 
can be found in the Strategic Housing and Employment Land Availability Assess ment 
(SHELAA) which accompanies this Publication Plan . 
  
 Scale of Growth  
  
3.19 It is a requirement of the new National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) to, as a 
minimum, meet the objectively assessed needs for housing using the standard 
methodology set out in the Planning P ractice Guidance, unless exceptional 
circumstances justify an alternative approach.  The Council intends to meet our housing 
number as identified through the standard methodology, and to apply an appropriate 
delivery buffer due to high reliance on one large site, W elborne  Garden V illage, coming 
forward . 
  
3.20 The figure identified through the current standard methodology is higher than that 
included in the Draft Local Plan, which was consulted upon in 2017.  This increase wa s 
the main reason that the Council work ed to  update the plan  and consult on additional 
housing allocations and the potential for Strategic Growth Areas.  However, the 
Government is consulting on a revised standard methodology which would see 
Fareham's need fall again.  This document sets out, f or consultation, how the Council 
anticipates the housing need based on the revised standard methodology  will be met. 
More information on the standard methodology and the implications for t he Borough can 
be found in the H ousing  Need and Supply  chapter (Chap ter 4).   
  
3.21 The development strategy proposed by the Local  Plan includes:  
 
• Provision for  at least  8,389 9,556  new residential dwellings and 104,000 121,964 m2 
of new employment floorspace;  
• The strategic employment site at Daedalus (Solent  Enterprise Zone ) to deliver an 
additional 77,200 m2 of employment floorspace over and above that already 
planned  for;  
21 
  • Strategic opportunities in Fareham Town Centre that contribut e to the delivery of at 
least  428 961 dwellings as part of a wider regeneration strategy;  
• Development allocations on previously developed land where available, and on 
greenfield land around the edges of existing urban areas in order to meet remaining 
housing and employment needs, but otherwise managing appropriate levels of  
development outside of urban areas.   
  
3.22 The locations proposed for development in the Local Plan are shown on the key diagram 
(Figure 3.1).

   Role of Evidence in shaping the Development Strategy  
  
3.23 The Development Strategy and chosen sites have been shaped through analysis of the 
evidence base and the Sustainability Appraisal /Strategic Environmental Assessment 
(SA/SEA)  of strategic options, sites and policies in compliance with the Town and 
Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 and Environmental 
Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004.   
  
3.24 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and Planning Practice Guidance 
require Local Plans to be based on adequate, up -to-date and relevant evidence about 
the economic, social and environmental characteristics a nd prospects of the area.  As 
such, a comprehensive and proportionate evidence base has been collected to inform 
the approach of this Local Plan.   
  
3.25 
 
 
 
 Sustainability Appraisal is a statutory and systematic process that must be carried out 
during the preparation of a Local Plan. Its role is to promote sustainable development, a 
key guiding principle for Plan -making, by assessing the extent to which the emerging 
approach of the plan (i.e. the 'Development Strategy ’) integrates environmental, 
economic and social considerations into the Plan's preparation.  
  
3.26 An important part of the Sustainability Appraisal is the testing of reasonable alternatives.  
In terms of the Development Strategy, this began in 2017 with the consideration of eleven  
alternative spatial strategies for development which were assessed and t hen submitted 
for public consultation within the SA Report for the Draft Plan (2017), alongside the 
Council’s preferred option which was presented in the Draft Local Plan (2017).    
  
3.27 Following the introduction of the standard methodology for calculating housing need and 
the subsequent need to review the housing numbers proposed for the new Local Plan, 
these eleven alternatives were then augmented in 2019  with consideration of eight bro ad 
areas across the Borough which may be able to play a role in supporting the additional 
growth that the new Local Plan  at that time, needed  to consider  (see figure 3.2) .   
   
25 
   
 
 Figure 3.2 Eight potential growth areas that formed part of the Issues an d Options 
consultation of 2019.  (Note, at that stage the plan period was to end in 2036.)  
  
3.28 These eight growth areas were subject to consultation in the Issues and Options 
consultation of 2019 and the Interim SA /SEA  (2020) included a high-level assessment 
of each different growth area.  Both the consultation responses and the  Interim  SA 
support ed the preferred options for new allocations and two strategic growth areas 
presented as part of the Local Plan Supplement consultation (2020) .  Therefore together, 
these two stages of SA represent the tes ting of reasonable alternatives.   Further 
information can be found in the SA/SEA.  
  
 Development in the Countryside  
  
 Why we need this policy  
  
3.29 The countryside (i.e. areas outside of the Urban Area  boundary ) provides many positive 
aspects , including landscape features, natural green spaces and places for recreation.  
The countryside can range from unspoilt places, such as the coast and waterways, to 
landscapes that have been managed in sensitive ways for many decades supporting the 
rural e conomy .  The need to protect our countryside from unplanned and large -scale  
development that would change its nature forever is recognised by national policy.   
  
3.30 The NPPF states that planning policies should contribute to and enhance the natural 
environment by recognising the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside. It 
provides a distinction with the urban areas in terms of the built form and in planning terms 
denotes areas where more restrictive policies on development can be applied.  
  
 
26 
  3.31 Several of the  strategic priorities of the Local Plan relate  to focus ing development within 
the existing urban area and within specific site allocations that have been determined 
taking into account their sustainable merits (individually and cumulatively) and which 
accord with the Development Strategy and other evidence which supports the Local 
Plan.  To support this approach, development outside of the urban areas will be managed 
to resist encroachment of development into non -urban  unsustainable  areas.    
  
3.32 However, it is recognised th at countryside locations can be suit able for some forms of 
development, particularly tourism sites such as for camping and caravanning, leisure 
facilities such as playing fields and water -based facilities, and small -scale housing 
development where the character of the surrounding area can be  protected.  Community 
facilities, including cemeteries, which stand on the edge of the urban area can provide 
important facilities for the community. In addition, the open character of these sites can 
provide important views from the built form into the o pen countryside beyond.  
  
3.33 In addition, many existing employment, educational, community and leisure uses are 
already located in the countryside.  A policy is needed to allow the continuation of these 
uses where they perform a function to the community and/or provide jobs. The focus will 
be on retaining, maintaining and improving existing facilities outside of the urban area, 
which are valued by the community so they can meet changing needs as necessary and 
where possible and appropriate, locat ing any new community facilities inside the urban 
area.  
  
3.34 The NPPF also states that planning policies should recognise the wider benefits from 
the countryside including the economic and other benefits of the best and most versatile  
agricultural land. Further, f ootnote 53 in the NPPF outlines that ‘where significant   
development of agricultural land is demonstrated to be necessary, areas of poorer q uality 
land should be preferred to those of a higher quality".   
  
3.35 It is important that when determining applications for housin g and economic 
development, the benefits of protecting the  Best and  Most  Versatile (BMV) a gricultural 
land are considered  against the need for development.  The Borough would not be able 
to meet its  identified  housing  and employment  needs  on previously developed 
(brownfield) land, and greenfield sites of lower agricultural quality, alone. For this reason, 
the alloca tion of residential development on BMV agricultural land in this Plan has been 
necessary to meet  the id entified  housing  and employment  need.  As such, it is vital  the 
Council seeks  to protect the remaining BMV  agricultural land within the Borough.   
  
3.36 In addition, the countryside provides settlement distinction (and in some cases areas 
have been protected more specifically through the identification of a Strategic Gap ), and 
the open countryside often contains valued landscapes that can be particula rly sensitive 
to change or development. These two policy areas are dealt with separately within this 
chapter.  
  
 Strategic Policy DS 1: Development in the Countryside  
 
Proposals for development in the countryside , which is defined as land outside 
the Urban Area boundary as shown on the Policies map, will be supported where 
the proposal : 
a) Is for  development  associated with an existing lawful  dwelling , or 
b) Is proposed on previously developed land and appropriate for the  
27 
  proposed use,  or 
c) Is for retail,  community  and leisure  facilities,  tourism  or specialist  housing 
where it can be demonstrated that there is a local need for the facility  that 
cannot be met by existing facilities elsewhere;  or 
d) Is for a new or replacement building, conversion and/or extension within 
an existing educational facility (as identified on the Policies map) and 
would not result in the loss of playing fields and/or sports pitches unle ss 
it can be demonstrated that these facilities are no longer required or they 
can be adequately replaced elsewhere on site  or, 
e) Is for housing  development  compliant  with one of the following  policies;  
HP1, HP2, HP4, HP5, HP6 or HP11, or  
f) Is for employment development compliant with one of the following 
policies: E1 or E5,  or 
g) Is for a new small -scale  employment  development  to convert  or extend  an 
existing building, or replace a redundant or derelict structure,  or 
h) Provides infrastructure that meets an overriding public  need.  
 
In addition, proposals will need to demonstrate that they ; 
i) Require a location outside of the urban area, and 
j) Conserve and enhance landscapes, sites of biodiversity or geological 
value and soils, and  
k) Recognise  the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside and, if 
relevant , do not significantly affect the integrity of a Strategic Gap , and  
l) Maintain the character of the undeveloped coast, and  
m) Are not on Best and Most Versatile agricultural land .  
  
 How this policy works  
  
3.37 Policy DS1 establishes the principles of the types of development that may be deemed 
acceptable within the countryside ( i.e. outside of urban areas ), so that only the 
developments that can demonstrate no harm to the intrinsic character and beauty of the 
countryside will be supported. These proposals may include developments which 
support small -scale residential development, sites solely for affordable housing, 
employment uses  or countryside recreation, leisure and tourism  uses .   
  
3.38 Applying the brown field first approach to development enshrined in national policy, t he 
development of previously developed land and under -utilised buildings will be supported 
particularly if this would help to meet housing  or employment  needs.   In all cases, 
evidence of th e need for a countryside location will be needed to support applications.  
  
3.39 Policy DS1  signposts to a number of housing policies that are featured in the Housing 
Policies chapter (Chapter 5) where residential development may be deemed acceptable.  
Applicants must refer to those policies in addition to Policy DS1 in order to understand 
how a ny application will be judged.  
  
3.40 This policy seeks to support proposals for new community, leisure, education facilities 
that meet an identified need which cannot be met by existing facilities . Such facilities 
could combine several functions and provide useful social and recreational acti vities.    
  
3.41 The policy aims to support existing businesses and new employment proposals outside 
of urban areas. To allow for flexibility in the local economy, proposals for additional  
28 
  employment development that contributes to the local economy, suc h as start -up 
business accommodation or live -work units, will be supported. Employment uses will 
often only require minor alterations to the exterior structure of a building, thereby 
maintaining its traditional appearance in the countryside.   
  
3.42 All proposals will be judged in terms of their loca tion, scale and design.  They will be 
tested against all other relevant policies in the plan, including, but not limited to, policy 
DS2 on Strategic Gaps, DS 3 on Landscape and policy D1 on Design.  Any such new 
development will need to be respectful of the landscape and character of the area, the 
amenity of any neighbouring development and must not have an adverse effect on traffic 
or noise. All proposed development shall consider its relatio nship to and its impact on 
the local road network. Where it is likely that the proposed development will attract 
visitors, the site will need to be accompanied by a Travel Plan in accordance with Policy 
TIN1  of this Plan.  
  
   Settlement identity  
  
 Why we need this policy  
  
3.43 The need to respect settlement boundaries and protect the identity of our key settlements 
has been a strong influence on planning decisions to date.    The primary purpose of 
identifying Strategic Gaps is to prevent the coalescence of separate settlements and 
help maintain distinct community identities.  Strategic Gaps do not necessarily have 
intrinsic landscape value but are important in maintaining the settlement pattern, defining  
settlement character  and providing green infrastructure opportunities.  
  
3.44 Two strategic gaps have previously been established in the Borough; one in the Meon 
valley and the other between the settlements of Fareham and Stubbington. The Council 
has reviewed the Strategic Gaps alongside the preparation of this Publication Plan , and 
the evidence is available to view  to support the Publication Plan11. Strategic gaps have 
been  retained but the policy and the spatial designation has been tightened to focus on 
preventing settlement coalescence. As mentioned in para 3.10 , this work has been 
undertaken in  response to the NPPF and recent planning appeals where the function, 
and strength of, the strategic gaps were question ed.  
  
3.45 The review of the Strategic Gap designations within the Borough has considered it 
important to retain the Strategic Gaps in the Borough .  The Meon Gap  plays a vital role 
in helping to maintaining the separation of Titchfield from settlements to the west and 
east of the valley, preventing sprawl from both Fareham and Titchfield 
Common/Titchfield Park and protecting the countryside setting of Stubbington.  The 
Meon Gap is also identified to be of strategic significance to the South Hampshire sub -
region by the PfS H Spatial Position Statement (2016) as it demarks the boundary of the 
Portsmouth and Southampton Housing Market Areas.  
  
3.46 Retaining the open farmland gap between Fareham and Stubbington is critical in 
preventing the physical coalescence of these two settlements together with maintaining 
the sense of separation.  Although no boundary changes are proposed at this time, 
evidence has shown boundary of this strategic gap could be redrawn whilst retaining its  
important function of preventing settlement coal escence.   Further to the east, retaining

and the Strategic Gaps (2020)   
29 
  the gap will help maintain the separation of Stubbington and Lee -on-the-Solent from 
Fareham and Bridgemary along with maintaining the separate identity of Peel Common.  
  
 Strategic Policy DS 2:  Development in Strategic Gaps  
 
In order to prevent the coalescence of urban areas and to maintain the separate 
identity of settlements, Strategic Gaps are identified  as shown on the Policies 
map between the following areas:  
 
1) Fareham / Stubbington and the W estern Wards (Meon Gap)  
2) Fareham / Bridgemary and Stubbington / Lee -on-the-Solent  (Fareham - 
Stubbington Strategic Gap)  
 
Development proposals will not be permitted where they significant ly affect the 
integ rity of the gap and the  physical and visual separation of settlements  or the 
distinctive nature of settlement characters.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
3.47 The principle of major development within the strategic gaps is not established . Any 
development proposals will need to demonstrate how they could be developed in a 
manner which meets the tests within the policy.  Information on settlement identity, 
location and scale of development as well as how any edge treatments could retain the 
physical and visual separation of settlements will be required.  
  
   Landscape  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
3.48 Despite its modest scale, the Borough of Fareham contains a rich and varied pattern of 
landscapes that has evolved from historical, physical and human influences, including 
prehistoric colonisation, roman influences, farming practices of the middle ages an d the 
growth of the wrought iron and brickworks industries. This has produced a landscape of 
mixed character ranging from areas of unspoilt countryside, transitional landscapes on 
the fringes of built -up areas and along roads, to the true urban landscapes,  or 
townscapes, of the Borough’s towns and settlements.  
  
3.49 The NPPF states that planning policies should contribute to and enhance the natural and 
local environment by protecting and enhancing valued landscapes in a manner 
commensurate with their st atutory status or identified quality in the development plan.  
As a response to this, this Local Plan has identified  eight  Areas of Special Landscape 
Quality which represent the most valued landscapes in the Borough, and in line with the 
NPPF, these should be protected and enhanced. These are shown in Figure 3.3.  This is 
not an exhaustive list of valued landscapes and the policy also provides applicants with 
an indication of how landscape value could be argued for any part of the Borough.    
  
3.50 Two recent planning appeal decisions demonstrated how valued landscapes could help 
to determine planning decisions. Both decisions were on sites located in the Lower Meon 
Valley (Land west of Old Street, Stubbington APP/A1720/W/18/3200409 and Land east 
of Posbrook Lane, Titchfield APP/A1720/W/18/3199119) and the Inspectors recognised 
the high -quality landscape concluding that the Lower Meon is a valued landscape.   
30 
    
3.51 With this in mind, the Council proposed the designation of valued landscapes as part o f 
the Issues and Options  consultation in the summer of 2019. The responses to this part 
of the consultation suggested numerous parts of the Borough held a value for residents 
and other respondents. Responses suggested that green spaces, coastal areas, open 
spaces, historic areas and treed landscapes were all valued in the Borough.  
  
3.52 Chalklands are an important component of the landscape in the north east of the 
Borough occurring in a broad sweeping band focussed around the scarp face of 
Portsdown Hill and its flanks. Lowland mosaic landscapes account for the majority of the 
Borough’s non-urban landscapes and tend to include a mix of farmland and woodland. 
A distinction can be made  in landscape terms  between the open landscapes of the 
coastal plain  such as at Wicor and in the Chilling area  and those that lie further inland to 
the north and west of the Borough , but nonetheless they all symbolise a degree of special 
landscape quality . 
  
3.53 The Meon valley is the main river valley landscape within the Borough, although the 
character varies along the length of the valley floor and sides.  Open floodplain farmland 
also exists in the Wallington river valley whilst the Hamble valley is characterised by both 
open  and enclosed valley sides.   
  
3.54 The 2017 Landscape Assessment , alongside the Technical Review of Areas of Special 
Landscape Quality and the Strategic Gaps  (2020 ) recognise  the intrinsic character and 
quality of these largely undeveloped areas and so these have been used to shape the 
revised development strategy and are proposed as Areas of Special Landscape Quality 
for the new Local Plan.   
  
3.55 In addition, recognising that all parts of the Borough have some landscape quality and 
may be sensitive to landscape change, the following policy , which was  consulted upon 
in early 2020 , demonstrates how landscape should be dealt with in terms of development 
management.  31

   Strategic Policy DS 3: Landscape  
 
Areas of Special Landscape Quality have been identified in the Borough  and are 
shown on the Policies map.   Development proposals shall  only be permitted in 
these areas where the landscape will be protected and enhanced.  
 
Development in the countryside shall recognise the intrinsic character and 
beauty of the countryside, paying particular regard to:  
a) Intrinsic landscape character, quality and important features;  
b) Visual setting, including to/from key views;  
c) The landscape as a setting for settlements, i ncluding important views to, 
across, within and out of settlements;  
d) The landscape’s role as part of the existing Local Ecological network;  
e) The local character and setting of buildings and settlements , including 
their historic significance ;  
f) Natural landscape features, such as trees, ancient woodland, hedgerows, 
water features and their function as ecological networks; and  
g) The character of the Borough’s rivers and coastline, which should be 
safeguarded.  
 
Major development proposals must incl ude a comprehensive landscaping 
mitigation and enhancement scheme to ensure that the development is able to 
successfully integrate with the landscape and surroundings. The landscaping 
scheme shall be proportionate to the scale and nature of the development  
proposed and shall be in accordance with the enhancement opportunities 
specified in the Council’s Landscape Sensitivity Assessment12. 
 
  
 How this policy works  
  
3.56 The criteria within the policy (points a -g) are derived from the Guidel ines for Landscape 
and Visual Impact Assessment (GLVIA 3) published by the Landscape Institute.    
  
3.57 Development proposals within Areas of Special Landscape Quality are expected to 
submit a proportionate Landscape Assessment, that demonstrates the proposal 
satisfies the specific development criteria contained within the Council’s Landscape 
Sensitivity Ass essment for the character area in which the development is located.  
  
3.58 In referring to the Council’s Landscape Sensitivity Assessment, this relates to Part 2 of 
the Landscape Assessment where each Landscape Character Areas (LCA) is further 
broken down into Local Landscape Character Areas (LLCA) and described in terms of 
sensi tivity to development and ability to accommodate change.  This sensitivity relates 
to four elements; the area as part of the Borough’s landscape resources, the area as 
part of the visual environment enjoyed within the Borough (its visual amenity), the area  
as part of the setting and identity of urban areas within the Borough and fourthly, as 
part of the Green Infrastructure Network within the Borough.  After providing a

33 
  sensitivity assessment of each LLCA in the four categories, development criteria and 
enhancement opportunities are provided.  While any Landscape Sensitivity 
Assessment should consider the sensitivity assessment for each potential affected 
LLCA, the main focus of the assessment should be on addressing the considerations  
noted for proposed dev elopment and the extent to which the enhancement 
opportunities can be accommodated within the proposals.

 Housing Requirement  
  
4.1 Addressing housing need through the provision of new homes is a fundamental part of 
any Local Plan. The NPPF is clear that planning authorities should prepare Local Plans to 
boost the supply of housing to meet the needs of the area as well as keeping a rolling 
supply of housing land available for development.  
  
4.2 Local housing need should be determined by using the s tandar d methodology set out in 
national Planning Practice Guidance (PPG). This methodology  currently  combines 2014 -
based household projections with affordability data released in March 202 10 to calculate 
the annual need. Using this method, t he housing need  for F areham currently stands at a 
minimum of 514 541 dwellings per annum  (dpa) .  However, Iin August 2020, the 
Government released a consultation on a new standard methodology which afford eds 
council s the option of using either a percentage of the Borough’s existing housing stock 
as the calculation’s starting point or the most up -to-date household projections, whichever 
wasis the higher, before an affordability uplift wasis applied.    The Council  therefore 
consider eds it appropriate for th eis 2020 Publication Local Plan to plan for a scale of 
growth based on the proposed new methodology, and not one based on out -of-date 
household projections.  This reduce ds the housing need figure to 403 dpa , based  on a 
base date of 2021 .  The new methodology would be introduce d with a change to the PPG 
and the timing of submission of this plan for examination will be determine d by the precise 
wording of the government policy.  However, in December 2020  the Governme nt 
announced that the new methodology would not proceed on this basis  and so the housing 
requirement for Fareham Borough reverted to 541.  In line with the PPG, this requirement 
is now fixed for two years to allow the submission, examination and adoption o f the plan.  
  
4.3 The PPG makes it clear that this is a minimum figure and the Council  could adopt a higher 
figure  for its housing requirement .  One of the reasons for doing so would be if the need 
for affordable housing is greater than that likely to be delivered through the delivery of the 
level of growth aligned with the standard methodology.  The need for affordable housing 
in the Borough is  based on the number of existing and newly formed households who lack 
their own housing and cannot afford to meet their housing needs in the market. Through 
calculating the affordable housing provision in line with the proposed policy (Policy HP5: 
Provisio n of Affordable Housing, see Chapter 5), the Council 's affordable need will be met.  
Therefore, the Council  believes it is fully justified in its approach towards meeting 
affordable need in the Publicatio n Local Plan and there is no further requirement for an 
adjustment of the need figures for the Borough.  
  
4.4 One of the other scenarios why a council  could adopt a higher housing figure as its Local 
Plan requirement is where there is an agreement to take on unmet need from neighbouring 
authorities.  Unmet need arises where a council  cannot identify sufficient sites, termed 
'supply' , to address their identified need. This situation gives rise to 'unmet need' which 
should be taken into account by neighbouring authorities .  Through the Partnership for 
South Hampshire (PfSH), the Council  is aware that there is a significant likelihood of  a 
substantial level of unmet need in the sub -region.  Figures released in September 2020, 
suggest that over the plan period, the unmet need in the sub -region could be  circa 10,750  
dwellings.  This figure is derived from eleven  council s who are all at diff erent stages of 
plan preparation , and importantly, is based on the current standard methodology and not 
the proposed new methodology which will see some levels of housing need fall in the sub -
region, while other levels will increase substantially .  In addi tion, while their need figure 
may be calculated  from publicly available data, details of the housing sites that may form 
part of their Local Plan  supply  is not entirely known .  Therefore, the level of unmet need 35 
across the wider sub -region will change  as the new standard methodology is introduced 
and as other Local Plans progress.  
4.5 Considering Fareham's immediate neighbours, Portsmouth City Council  have written to 
the Council  requesting a contribution of 1,000 dwellings to their unmet need situation. 
However, based on figures released in September 2020, this  is currently estimated to be 
669 dwellings ., and this could reduce in light of the proposed new standard methodology 
which reduced Portsmouth's annual housing need .  Gosport Borough Council  is also likely 
to have an unmet need issue, currently estimated to be  in the region of 2,500  homes , but 
equally likely to reduce with the new standard methodology and as it confirm s its housing 
supply situation ..  Havant  BC are at an advanced Local Plan stage and have confirmed 
their inability to contribute to sub -regional unmet need.  Both Eastleigh BC and Winchester  
CC, at their respective plan preparation stage s, have identified a surplus in their supply , 
but again this c ould change particularly given the proposed new standard methodology 
which significantly increases need in these two areas ..  Only Portsmouth have requested 
that Fareham's Local Plan includes housing to address their unmet need, however, with 
the fact that  unmet need exists confirmed and in the public domain, it would be contrary 
to the spirit of collaboration as required by government policy, to not consider the 
contribution that could be made. Therefore, t his Publication Plan makes provision for 
847900 homes to contribute toward the wider unmet need issue. Therefore, the need 
figure increases by 847 900to provide the total housing requirement for this Publication 
Plan.  
4.6 The table below  (Table 4.1) indicates how the housing requirement for the new Local 
Plan is calculated .

Table 4.1 Local Plan Housing Requirement  
4.7 Paragraph 65 of the NPPF requires Local Plans to establish the housing requirement for 
any neighbourhood areas.  There are two Titchfield  is the only  designated neighbourhood 
areas in Fareham Borough ,. Titchfield and Warsash .  The draft Titchfield neighbour hood 
plan did not include housing allocations and fail ed at referendum in July 2019. The Council 
is not aware of any intention to continue to develop a Titchfield Neighbourhood Plan.  
Warsash neighbourhood area and forum were designated in July 2019 and t he forum have 
not expressed an intention to allocate housing nor have they requested a requirement 
figure in line with paragraph 66 of the NPPF.  Therefore , the two Therefore the Titchfield  
neighbourhood area s havse not been assigned a housing requirement figure.   Should one 
be requested, it would be calculated based on the proposed allocations, any adopted Local 
Plan allocations, current commitments and estimates of windfall in those spatial areas.  
Housing Supp ly  
 
36 
 
4.8 In order to establish how the Local Plan can meet this requirement, the Council  can take 
into account existing commitments including outstanding planning permissions (i.e. 
housing permitted but not yet built), sites where the Council 's Planning Committee has 
resolved to grant planning permission but the permission has not yet been fo rmally issued 
(these are termed 'resolutions to grant), housing sites that were allocated in previous 
adopted Local Plan and estimates of future windfall permissions. The result is shown in 
table 4.2. 
  
4.9 Although the Welborne Plan is not being reviewe d, the development at Welborne Garden 
Village will make a considerable contribution to meeting the housing requirement over the 
plan period.  The review of Welborne’s delivery trajectories has taken into account matters 
arising since the Welborne Plan was adopted in 2015.  For example, the Government has 
designated Welborne a Garden Village and importantly the Planning Committee has 
resolved to grant planning permission  for the development of the site.  Increasing clarity 
on likely start dates and delivery rates has enabled the Council  to understand the extent 
of development required for the remainder of the Borough in order to meet the Borough’s 
overall housing and employment needs.  
  
4.10 The Council  has conducted several  calls for sites to establish whi ch land in the Borough 
is available for development. All sites which were submitted were then assessed for 
suitability and achievability through the Strategic Housing  and Economic  Land Availability 
Assessment (SH ELAA). The allocation of sites in this Plan has also been informed by the 
evidence base including the Sustainability Appraisal  (SA/SEA)  of individual sites .  Each 
housing site has its own allocation policy, within this chapter.  
  
4.11 The housing supply incorporates a windfall allowance , in accordance with the provisions 
set out in paragraph 70 of the NPPF.  Windfall developments are those which have not 
been specifically identified as being available in the Local Plan process, and ofte n 
comprise previously developed sites that have unexpectedly become available.  The 
NPPF states that windfall allowances should be realistic and have regard to the  Strategic 
Housing  and Employment  Land Availability Assessment (SH ELAA), historic windfall 
delivery rates and  expected future trends .  The Council  has undertaken a Housing Windfall 
Projections Background Paper  which has indicated that 1,224 new dwellings are likely to 
be completed between 202 4/25 and 203 6/37 in the Borough (windfall completions fr om 
now until 202 4 are assumed to already have planning permission and therefore have 
already been counted).

4.12 Table 4 .2 shows  that there are sufficient sites to provide 10,594 8,389 net new homes 
across  Fareham Borough from 2021 up to 2037 .  Government policy requires that the 
supply is greater than the housing requirement to ensure that the Plan is sufficiently 
flexible to accommodate needs not anticipated in the Plan and to provide a contingency 
should  delivery on some sites not match expectations.  A minimum of 10% additional 
supply is suggested by the Planning Inspectorate but given the reliance on large sites 
within the supply, a more precautionary 115% is proposed. As table 4.3 shows, the surpl us 
in the supply equates to 115% of the total requirement.

 Provision of small sites in supply  
  
4.13 Within the supply, a total of 892 995 dwellings are identified as  to be  provided on sites of 
less than 1 hectare. The NPPF states that ‘local authorities should,  identify  through the 
development plan and brownfield registers, land to accommodate at least 10% of their 
housing requirement on sites no larger than one hectare ; unless it can be shown, through 
the preparation of relevant plan policies , that there  are strong reasons why this  target 
cannot be achieved ’. Of the sites in the supply,  11 9.4% of homes are on sites of 1 hectare 
or less.  In order to support small sites,  the Council  proposes a specific policy to encourage 
small sites in sustainable locations in the Borough.  More information can be found in 
Chapter 5 and specifically Policy HP2.  
  
 Housing Provision  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
4.14 The NPPF makes clear that Local Plans should plan positively for the housing  needs of 
the area, including taking account of housing needs  that cannot be met in neighbouring 
areas .  Planning authorities are expected to boost the supply of housing to meet th e needs 
of the area as well as keeping a rolling supply of housing land  available for development.   
Policy H1 sets out the housing requirement for the Borough for 2021 -2037  and how the 
Council  expects to meet that need.  
   
 
38 
 
4.15 Paragraph 67 of the NPPF requires planning policies to identify a sufficient supply and 
mix of sites for at least the first five years of the plan period.  Following the first five years, 
Local Plans can either identify specific sites or broad locations for growth.  This Publ ication 
Plan identifies specific sites  (see Polic ies FTC3 -9 andHA1-HA56 44). 
  
4.16 The overall Local Plan for the Borough allocates a significant proportion of development 
at the Welborne Garden Village.   It is expected that the majority of the housing sites will 
start to deliver to the latter part of the five -year period and Welborne will also commence 
in the short to medium term .  Information  on delivery rates  has been gathered from  
developers and land agents and adjusted as appropriate based on recent trends . 
Therefore , in line with paragraph 73 of the NPPF, the Council  considers  a stepped housing 
requirement, and trajectory , to be appropriate  reflecting that housing delivery will be lower 
in the first 0 -5 years, particularly the first two years .  It is also appropriate  to use the Local 
Plan process to secure a five year housing land supply, albeit imposing a 20% buffer in 
light of an anticipated the 2020  Housin g Delivery Test results  due to be published in 
November 2020 (for the three years to 31 st March 2020).  . 
  
 Strategic Policy H1: Housing Provision   
 
The Council  will make provision for a t least 9,5608,389 net new homes across the 
Borough during the Plan period of 2021 -2037 , phased as follows,  
• Approximately 9002,250 dwellings (averaging 300450 dwellings per 
annum) between 2021/22 and 2025/26 2023/2413, 
• Approximately 2,400 2,180 dwellings (averaging 480 545 dwellings per 
annum) between 2026/272024/25 and 2030/312027/28, 
• Approximately 3,750 6,480  dwellings (averaging 720625 dwellings per 
annum) between 2031/322028/29  and 203 6/2037. 
 
 Housing will be provided through;  
 
• An estimated 552 869 homes on sites that already have planning 
permission ;  
• An estimated 4,858 4,184 homes on sites with resolutions to grant planning 
permission as of 01 July 2020  01 April 2021 , including at Welborne Garden 
Village;  
• Approximately 1,327 3,358 homes on sites allocated in policies HA1, HA3, 
HA4, HA7 , HA9-HA10, HA12, HA13, HA15, HA17, HA19, HA22 -HA24, HA26 -
HA56 44; 
• Approximately 428 959 homes on specified brownfield sites and/or 
regeneration opportunities in Fareham Town Centre, as identified in 
policies FTC 1 3-9 6 and BL1 ; 
• An estimated 1,224 homes delivered through unexpected (windfall) 
development.

4.17 The low level of housing completions in recent years and unusually low number of 
outstanding permissions reflects the issue that many local authorities  in south Hampshire  
are facing,  since February 2019 , with the effect development has on nitrate levels in th e 
Solent  resulting in an inability to grant planning permission at normally expected rates. 
This situation has created a significant lag in the number of houses that can reasonably 
be expected to come forward, particularly in the first two years of the pla n period  and 
justifies the stepped nature of the housing requirement .  This is further evidenced in the 
trajectory provided at Appendix B  where delivery rates are estimated.  This information on 
delivery has been gathered with the assistance of developers, landowners and site 
promoters and provides certainty over the delivery of sites, particularly within years 0 -5 
and 6 -10, in accordance w ith the NPPF.  
  
4.18 The specific allocations of sites to address the housing requirement are outlined in th is 
chapter , alongside the site -specific policy requirements that any application will be 
judged upon.  The allocations include an indicative yield which seeks to ensure the 
effective use of land by identifying the minimum housing delivery for each site.  
  
4.19 For the avoidance of doubt, policies FTC1, FTC2, HA2, HA5, HA6, HA8, HA11, HA14, 
HA16, HA18,  HA20,  HA21, HA25  do not exist.   These references relate to policies that 
were consulted upon during the Draft Local Plan 2017 consultation and are no longer 
proposed to be allocated in the Local Plan.  This may be because the site is no longer 
available or deemed to be suitable.   
  
4.20 The delivery of potential sites will be kept up to date through a regular review of the 
Strategic Housing and Employment Land Availability Assessment (SHELAA). The 
Authority Monitoring Report (AMR) will include information on  housing delivery alongsid e 
regular five year supply statements published on the Council’s website .

 Sheltered Housing Allocations  
  
 Why we need these policies  
  
4.21 Based on the recommended ratios provided by the Elderly Accommodation Council , the 
greatest demand for future specialist provision within the  Borough will be sheltered 
housing.  Provision for sheltered housing within the  Borough is managed through 
the Council ’s Housing Register. Applicants for sheltered housing represent 
approximate ly 14% of those waiting for any type of housing. Sheltered housing schemes 
are bespoke and need to be delivered in blocks or groups (often with a Sheltered Housing 
Officer based on site).   Applicants must be aged over 55 to be eligible for sheltered 
housin g, and the projections show that the number of applicants will increase by 16% 
from 20 20 to 203 7. The greatest increases in demand for units  are expected to be 
witnessed in Portchester and Fareham South as shown in the following table.

4.22 The precise amount and type of specialist and older person accommodation required 
within the  Borough will depend on a range of factors including choices of individual 
people and households. However, to facilitate the delivery of older person’s 
accommodation the  Council  has identified three  sites considered  suitabl e for this type of 
development at Cams Alders , the Corner of Station road  and Assheton Court  in 
Portchester  for sheltered housing schemes to meet the demand for Housing Register 
applicants within the Fareham South and Portchester wards.   These sites are th erefore 
allocated for new sheltered housing provision and further general affordable housing 
provision.   The Cams Alders scheme will be delivered alongside investment in the leisure 
provision at the site.

Policy BL1: Broad Location for Housing Growth  
 
 
 
The Town Centre broad location, as identified on the policies map, has the potential to 
deliver up to 620 homes in years 10 to 16 of the Plan to meet the borough’s housing need. 
The continued renewal and redevelopment of the town centre is a priority for t he Plan. The 
Council has a strong ambition to secure delivery, recognising the wider placemaking, 
economic regeneration and health benefits that the scheme will provide.  
 
The area identified as the broad location currently includes surface and multistorey  car 
parks, the police station and bus station offices, Fareham Shopping Centre, Fareham 
Library, Ferneham Hall and the civic offices. The town centre like others across the country 
faces challenges from the economic downturn and changing retail patterns. Fareham town 
centre also supports a wide range of leisure and cultural attractions and enjoys an active 
night -time economy.  
 
The redevelopment of the town centre site will be a key component of the Local Plan housing 
delivery in the second half of the Pla n period with the Council developing  a supplementary 
planning document  to secure the comprehensive mixed -use redevelopment of the area 
including a consolidated, varied, and integrated retail and leisure offer and opportunities for 
residential development for approximately 620 dwellings in years 10 to 16 of the Local Plan, 
significant improvement to the public realm and improved accessibility to and through the 
town centre creating a healthier environment through improvements to air quality.  
 
 
 
153 
 
Development proposals for the area will be required to meet the following broad cri teria 
which will be set out in the  Fareham  Town Centre  Masterplan  Supplementary Planning 
Document:  
a) New development should demonstrate a quality of design that responds positively 
to the existing townscape, providing a variable and interesting form that will 
enhance the area as the focal point and gateway to Fareham; and  
b) Proposals should protect and consolidate retail uses and  ensure a mix of 
commercial leisure and retail operators creat ing a variety of uses  to ensure an 
interesting streetscape and vibran t uses during the day and evening; and  
c) Proposals will be expected to deliver vibrant, high quality outdoor public space s 
including a  new town square , linked by pedestrian spaces to other key town centre 
destinations .

  Housing Policies  
  
5.1 Providing new homes to address housing need is a critical part of any Local Plan. New 
homes are required to address population changes and the changing way in which people 
live. Addressing housing need is a key requirement of the National Planning Policy 
Framework (NPPF).  
  
5.2 The housing policies in this chapter aim to ensure that the housing needs in the Borough 
are addressed. The focus i s on enabling the delivery of homes to address the future needs 
of those living in the Borough. This includes (but is not limited to) those who require 
affordable homes (which includes first time renters/buyers), older people, people with 
disabilities, peop le wishing to build their own homes and the travelling community. The 
policies provide a framework that aim to deliver a better mix of new homes in terms of 
affordability, size and type. This will build sustainable, lifelong communities.  
  
 New Residenti al Development  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
5.3 The Local Plan focuses development in the existing urban areas and on specific allocated 
sites. In order to  maintain the quality of the countryside and ensure a sustainable approach 
to development, residential development outside of the urban area will be treated as bei ng 
within the countryside. The Urban Area b oundari es are defined on the Policies m ap. 
  
5.4 The countryside can face a variety of development pressures. Therefore, the Local Plan 
seeks to apply strict er control over residential development in the countryside to contribute 
towards meeting the wider aims of sustainability and to protect the cou ntryside from 
unsustainable  development.  
  
5.5 Defining the Urban Area b oundaries provides clarity for the application of these policies by 
providing a clear differentiation between urban and countryside (or non -urban) locations. 
Urban area boundaries pr otect the integrity of the countryside, providing a compact form to 
settlements, preventing sprawl, sporadic development and reducing the visual impact on the 
countryside.  
  
5.6 Whilst the Council seeks to protect countryside from inappropriate development it is 
recognised that there may be a need for residential development in the countryside in 
exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that a countryside location is both 
necessary and ju stified. The focus of Policy H P1 is on efficient use of existing buildings to 
meet need and for a one -for-one rep lacement dwellings Policy H P2: Small Scale 
Development Outside of Urban Areas focuses on development proposals of no more than 
four dwellings subject to meeting all the policy criteria.  
  
 Policy HP1: New Residential Development  
 
Residential development within the Urban Area bound ary, as shown on the Policies 
map, will be supported in principle . 
 
Residential development in locations outside of the Urban Area boundary will be 
permitted where one of the following applies:  
  
156 
 a) It involves a conversion of an existing non-residential building where:  
 
1) the building is structurally sound and capable of conversion without the 
need for significant extension, alteration or rebuilding; and  
2) evidence has been provided to demonstrate that no other suitable 
alternative uses can be found and conversion would lead to an 
enhancement to the building’s immediate setting.  
 
b) It is for a replacement dwelling which is of an appropriate character to the 
location.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
5.7 There may be instances where it is necessary for a new dwelling to be built in the countryside 
to meet the need for a worker to be accommodated on site, such as for an agricultural, 
forestry, horse -breeding or equivalent uses. The Council will require appl icants to 
demonstrate that the need cannot be met elsewhere.  
  
5.8 Existing buildings within the countryside may be subject to proposals for conversion or 
replacement. However, not all buildings in the countryside are suitable for conversion as 
they may be of in -substantial construction, of poor design or not in keeping w ith the 
surroundings. Buildings to be converted should be structurally sound and proposals which 
require significant extension, alteration or rebuilding will not be acceptable. Proposals for 
conversion should also seek to enhance the immediate setting of t he site.  
  
5.9 The replacement of existing lawful dwellings will be supported, but these should be in 
character with the location, particularly in terms of their visual impact.  
  
5.10 There may be some cases, where infill development is considered acceptable. Infill 
development in the Borough should comprise one or two dwellings within a continuous 
frontage.  
  
5.11 All development proposals that fall within one or more of the relevant policy criterion are 
designed and sited to minimise the impact to landscape sensitivity and other matters.  
  
 Small Scale Development Outside Urban Areas  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
5.12 Small housing development sites can make a significant contribution to the supply of new 
dwellings within the Borough, helping the Council to meet its housing need requirement. 
They also help to support small and medium sized house builders and those seeking self -
build plots.   
  
5.13 The NPPF supports the inclusion of small and medium sized sites in Local Plans and 
recommends that at least ten percent of the housing requirement is identified on sites no 
larger than one hectare.  Th e Council endeavour s to achieve this proportion through the 
Local Plan but recognises that traditionally, small sites have not been a significant part of 
housing supply.     
   
157 
 5.14 The Council will ensure that a proportion of large -scale sites include self -build plots and this 
is addressed in Policy HP9 . However, most small sites have historically been delivered within 
existing urban settlements, often as a result of  developing large single house plots or as 
amalgamations of smaller plots. Small site delivery has been declining over recent years as 
opportunities within existing urban settlements reduce.   
  
5.15 In order to maintain a suitable supply of small sites, the Council considers that, with careful 
design, there is scope to appropriately deliver small sites within or adjacent to existing 
sustainably located housing settlements within the Borough.  For that reason, it propos es a 
new policy that will allow such development to take place.  
  
 
 
 
158 Figure 5 .1 Indicative sketches of potentially appropriate approaches to small -scale development 
scenarios outside of defined urban areas.  
Policy H P2: New Small -Scale Development Outside the Urban A reas 
New small -scale housing development outside the Urban Area boundary, as shown 
on the Policies map, will be permitted where:  
1)The site is within or adjacent to existing areas of housing ; or
2)The site is well related to the settlement boundary ; and
3)The site is within reasonable proximity to a high frequency walking distance  to
a good bus service route or a train station as well as  safe walking and cycling
routes that connect to a local, district or town centre;  and
4)It comprises development that does not adversely affect the predominant
development form of the area, taking particular account of:
a.building line and scale of adjacent dwellings ;
b.plot size and proportion,
c.site coverage/ratio,
d.space between dwellings ,
e.landscape and views through to countr yside beyond ; and
5)It comprises development:
a.Of not more  than 4 units ; and
 
159 
 b. Where the design and external appearance of each dwelling  is 
demonstrably different, unless a terrace or semi -detached form is 
appropriate ; and  
c. That  does not extend the settlement frontage.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
5.16 The Council is seeking to ensure that the location of new plots is reasonably located in 
relation to existing centres to encourage non -motorised access to jobs, services community 
and leisure facilities.  Sites are considered to be particularly sustainable  if there is safe 
pedestrian or cycling access to;  
 
• a high-frequency bus stop within 400m  that provides a service equivalent to 2 buses 
per hour  between 7.30am and 6.30pm , or a train station within one mile (20 minutes’ 
walk or 1.6km), and  
• a local convenience store(s) selling day to day needs within approximately 800m 
(10 minutes’ walk).  
  
5.17 High quality contextual and sustainable design will be a key element of new small site delivery, 
in line with Policy D1. The Council will expect developmen t to be of high quality and ensure 
that the settlements’ essential characteristics are maintained, whilst ensuring that future 
occupants are well served by nearby centres.  
  
 Change of Use to Garden Land  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
5.18 There is a need to define an appropriate dwelling curtilage as the change of use of land to 
domestic gardens can have  a profound visual impact on the immediate settings and 
potential on the wider landscape, depending on the location of the site.  
  
 Policy HP 3: Change of Use to Garden Land   
 
A change  of use of land outside of the Urban A rea boundary to residential garden 
will be permitted where:  
 
a) It is in keeping with the character, scale  and appearance of the surrounding 
area;  and 
b) It will not detract from the existing landscape; and  
c) It respects the views into and out of the site . 
 
Proposals that include new boundary treatments must ensure that it is appropriate, 
and in keeping with the ch aracter of the surrounding area.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
5.19 The change of use of land to residential garden can provide useful additional private 
amenity space. However, it is recognised that the change of use could allow for further 
development on that land,  or use boundary treatments that are insensitive to their  
160 
  
16 As outlined in paragraph 11 of the NPPF  
17 APP/A1720/W/18/3199119  and APP/A1720/W/18/3200409  
18 Development Sites and Policy Plan (adopted 2015)   countryside context. Any new boundary treatments proposed should be chosen to 
minimise visual impact on the character of the surrounding area.  
  
5.20 The NPPF supports development of Previously Developed Land (PDL).  The definition in the 
Glossary at Annex 2 of the NPPF excludes residential gardens in the built -up area from the 
definition of Previously Developed Land (PDL), but not residential gardens in the countryside.  
  
5.21 The development of residential gardens has the potential for a number of harmful impacts, 
including on the character of the area, on biodiversity and living conditions. It is therefore 
essential that such proposals are controlled in order to protect the ch aracter and openness 
of the countryside, and the character and form of the urban area.  
  
 Flexibility in the Housing Supply  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
5.22 The Council is committed to delivering the housing requirement set out in the Local Plan, 
but it is important to provide a contingency position in the Plan to deal with unforeseen 
problems with delivery of both allocations and/or commitments.  Therefore, f urther flexibility 
in the Council’s approach is provided in Policy HP4: Five -Year Housing Land Supply. This 
potentially allows for additional sites to come forward, over and above the allocations in the 
Local Plan, where the Council cannot demonstrate  a five-year land supply against the Local 
Plan housing requirement . 
  
5.23 In the event that the Council does not have a five -year housing land supply the strategic 
policies of the Local Plan are disengaged and the 'presumption in favour of sustainable 
devel opment' applies as stated in Paragraph 11 of the NPPF. However, this could create 
a precedent for unsustainable development. Therefore, a policy is required to reinforce the 
principles of sustainable development16 as set out in the NPPF and provide additio nal 
guidance on how this would apply to such a development  proposal where a five year 
housing land supply cannot be demonstrated.  
  
5.24 In recent appeals17 the Council has successfully defended speculative, unsustainable 
developments with a policy guiding the determination of housing applications in cases 
where the Council cannot demonstrate a five -year supply.  In those cases, the Inspector 
awarded the Adop ted Local Plan Policy DSP4018 full weight in their assessment of the 
scheme, when the 'tilted balance' was applied. Given this use of a previous adopted policy, 
the Council is keen to bring the policy into the new Local Plan.  
  
 Policy HP 4: Five-Year Housing Land Supply  
 
If the Council cannot demonstrate a five -year supply of land for housing against the 
housing requirement set out in Policy H1, additio nal housing sites, outside the 
Urban A rea boundary, may be will be  permitted where they meet  all of the following 
criteria:  
 
a) The proposal is relative in scale  to the five -year housing   
161 
          land supply shortfall;  
b) The proposal is sustainably located adjacent to, and well related to, the  
       existing urban area boundaries, and can be integrated with  
       the neighbouring settlement;  
c) The proposal is sensitively designed to reflect the landscape character and 
setting of the settlement , is of a scale proportionate to its setting  and reco gnises 
the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside and, if relevant,  does not 
significantly affect the integrity of a Strategic Gap ; 
d) It can be demonstrated that the proposal is deliverable in the short term; and  
e) The proposal would not have any unacceptable environmental, amenity or traffic 
implications .  
  
 How this policy works  
  
5.25 In order to  accord with the Development Strategy and Policy DS1: Development in the 
Countryside, proposals for development outside the urban area boundaries will be strictly 
controlled.  Such proposals will only be considered if the Council cannot demonstrate that 
it has a five -year land supply against the housing requirements set out in Policy H1 of the 
Local Plan.  
  
5.26 The Local Plan favours development within the urban area and at specified allocation sites. 
However, in the event that the Council cannot demonst rate a five -year housing land supply 
a scheme t hat is proposed outside of the Urban A rea boundary would need to meet all of 
the criteria in Policy HP 4. Schemes within the urban area are likely to be policy compliant 
in any case and specific criteria guidin g how the application should be judged is not 
required, over the requirements of other relevant policies and material considerations within 
this Plan . The criteria provides a basis to ensure that any proposals coming forward  outside 
the urban area  is devel oped in a sustainable manner, in line with the principles of paragraph 
11 of the NPPF.   The criteria  in HP4  are required to ensure relevant policy considerations 
are given weight in a scheme's assessment. For instance, the Borough's open countryside 
conta ins valued landscape that are of special quality and any scheme that comes forward 
in the countryside would need to ensure it is sensitively designed to reflect the character of 
that landscape.  
  
5.27 Protecting the character and beauty of the countryside is an important objective and so the 
careful design of any proposal will be a key consideration. Any proposal m ust be adjacent 
to an existing Urban A rea boundary and designed to ensure it is as well related, and 
integrated, to the neighbouring settlement as possible.  Any proposal will also need to 
demonstrate that there will be no unacceptable environmental, amenity or traffic 
implications and that all other relevant policies in the Local Plan have been duly considered.  
  
5.28 To ensure that such additional housing schemes contribute towards any five -year supply 
shortage the Council will expect detailed information to be submitted to demonstrate the 
deliverability of the scheme.  This should include a detailed programme of delivery 
specificall y setting out when the proposal will be delivered.  If deemed necessary, the 
Council will include a planning condition to limit the commencement time to a year from the 
date of permission to ensure delivery in the short term.  In order to protect areas out side of 
the existing settlements from unnecessary levels of development, only proposals that are 
of a scale relative to any identified shortfall will be considered.

19 Fareham’s Affordable Housing Strategy – Fareham Borough Council (October 2019)  
20 http://www.fareham.gov.uk/housing/looking_for_a_home/affordablehousingneed.aspx   Affordable Housing  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
5.29 The provision of affordable homes is a key element of creating and maintaining balanced 
communities. One of the key issues facing residents in the Borough is the unaffordability 
of homes to rent or to buy. As such, the delivery of homes that are affordable is a priority. 
The Government defines affordable homes as comprising social rent, affordable rented, 
and intermediate housing (such as shared ownership and rent to buy) provided to eligible 
households whose needs are not met by the open market.  Social and a ffordable Rent 
homes are for those in affordable need on t he Council’s Housing Register. Affordable r ent 
can be charged at up to 80% of market rent (inclusive of service charge) but, in order to 
ensure those rents are locally affordable they  should not exceed the Local H ousing 
Allowance.  
  
5.30 The Council’s adopted Affordable Housing Strategy 19 recognises that there is a need for 
approximately 3,500  affordable homes up until 2036. Therefore, the delivery of n ew 
affordable homes is  a vital part of  the overall housing delivery in the Borough. Those in 
need of affordable housing will vary in terms of their circumstances such as income and 
overall housing choices available to them. Those waiting and eligible for  social and 
affordable rent homes will t ypically have fewer housing choices and be in greatest need of 
assistance.  
  
5.31 Alongside considering the affordable housing need in the Borough, the Council also have 
to consider what is a reasonable and viable expectation on developers in terms of t he 
percentage of dwellings that shou ld be provided as affordable hou sing in a scheme. The 
aim of the affordable housing policy is to deliver as many affordable homes as possible 
without compromising the overall housing delivery. This policy sets out how th e Local Plan 
will ensure that new housing development meets the affordable housing need in the 
Borough. This includes securing a percentage of affordable housing on market -led 
schemes.  
  
5.32 The size and mix for affordable housing must reflect the local need. The Council publish 
and update (at least annually) the identified affordable housing needs by area of the 
Borough20. The mix of affordable property sizes on individual schemes should closely 
reflect this need. It is recommended that any applica nt seeks the early advice and 
engagement of the Council’s Housing Strategy team to ensure that the developer is aware 
of the affordable housing size mix expectations in order to reflect local need . 
  
 Policy H P5: Provision of Affordable Housing  
 
Sites that can accommodate 10 or more dwellings or sites with an area of 0.5 
hectares or more shall provide:  
 
a) In the case of greenfield  sites 40% of dwellings as affordable housing;  and 
b) In the case of brownfield sites  35% of dwellings as affordable housing; and  
c) In the case of sites located within the defined Fareham town centre boundary, 
20% of dwellings as affordable housing.   
163 
  
21 There are no designated rural areas within the Borough and therefore the Council do not have the option of setting 
lower thresholds within the Plan. Only the standard thresholds apply to affordable housing provision .  
The affordable housing must be provided in accordance with the  following 
proportions:  
 
i. At lea st 10% as Social Rent; and  
ii. At least 55% as  Affordable Rent or Social Rent; and  
iii. The remainder, but no less than 10% as  Affordable Home Ownership.  
iv. The mix of property size and type s hould  reflect the local need and the site 
characteristics.  
 
The Council will only accept affordable housing provision off site  or an appropriate 
financial contribution in lieu  where it is robustly justified  and where it contributes to 
the objective of mixed and  balanced communities . 
 
All Affordable Rent provision shall have rents and service charge at no more than 
80% of market rent or the relevant Local Housing Allowance, whichever is the lower.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
5.33 The above threshold (trigger point) where affordable housing provision is required is in line 
with that currently contained in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)21 and 
updated PPG. The affordable housing requirement  has taken into account the increased 
viability is sues with smaller (often brownfield) sites. The affordable housing requirements 
have regard to the affordable need in the Borough (including the need for more social rent 
homes) and what viability evidence suggests can be sought from development . The 
Viabi lity Study concludes that affordable housing is not viable for older persons and 
specialist housing. Therefore, Policy HP5 does not apply to specialist housing or older 
persons housing.  
  
 Viability  of Affordable Housing  
  
5.34 The biggest policy impact on viability of a development is the proportion of affordable 
housing sought. The Council’s Viability Assessment (2019) identifies a viable level of 
affordable housing taking into account other infrastructure requirements and deve lopment 
costs. The Local Plan Viability Assessment (2019) suggests that 40% affordable housing 
is a viable requirement on greenfield development sites. However, brownfield sites and 
sites within the town centre boundary come under greater viability pressur e. The Viability 
Assessment therefore recommends that it is more appropriate to adopt a reduced 
affordable housing requirement of 35% affordable housing on brownfield sites and 20% in 
the case of sites within the Fareham town centre boundary. The Assessmen t assumes that  
on-site affordable housing is viable and deliverable unless exceptional circumstances 
demonstrate otherwise.  
  
5.35 Viability is considered at the plan making stage and should not need to be assessed on a 
case by case basis when determining planning applications. If the Council determines that 
the full on -site affordable housing delivery  cannot be made at the time of th e decision, the 
Council may require a review mechanism by way of  a planning obligation , to assess if  
164 
  
22 Planning Practice Guidance Paragraph: 007, Reference ID: 10 -007-20190509  
23 A recognised toolkit such as HCA Developers Appraisal Toolkit or the Communities Agency Economic 
Appraisal Toolkit. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/developmen t-appraisal -tool     circumstances have improved the positions to increase the provision to the full policy 
compliant amount.  This is more likely to be appropriate on larger or  phased developments.  
  
5.36 In instances where development viability is an issue, developers will need to submit 
sufficiently detailed viability evidence which will be reviewed by the Council and a third 
party22. To allow this analysis to take place in an open and transparent manner a viability 
report, completed using a recognised toolkit23, should be provided as part of pre -application 
discussion or application submission with the data and information available i n an open -
book format. The assessment should clearly outline the maximum number of affordable 
dwellings which can be achieved on site. Costs associated with the assessment and third 
party review should be met by the developer.  
  
5.37 In accordance with the NPPF, affordable housing provision should be made on site. Unless 
through  a viability assessment the off -site provision and financial contribution can be 
robustl y justified, and the agreed approach contributes to mixed and balanced 
comm unities.  
  
 Affordable Housing Tenure  
  
5.38 The Council’s Viability Assessment (2019) sets out the tenure split for affordable housing. 
The Council seeks to obtain a higher proportion of social/affordable rent. Those waiting for 
Social/Affordable Rent homes will be on the Council’s Housing Register and will typically 
be at lower income thresholds and not be able to easily access other forms of housing and 
therefore have fewer housing options available to them. Therefore Social/Aff ordable Rent 
homes have slightly greater priority to affordable home ownership products.    
  
5.39 In some instances, the te nure mix specified in Policy H P5 will not be appropriate.  For 
example, there may be some sites that deliver a small number of affordable homes where 
just one of two of each affordable tenure may not be attractive to a Registered Provider. 
There may also be instances where direct delivery of affordable homes by a Registered 
Provider or the Council will deliver a greater provision of one type of affordable tenure to 
offset or support affordable delivery elsewhere in the Borough. Separate to this any 
development proposal that delivers for mixed communities should avoid excessive clusters 
for single tenure affordable housing. A depart ure from the tenure split of affordable housing 
provision specified in the policy will require the scheme p romoter to provide a needs 
assessment to provide justification.  
  
 Affordable Housing Size and Mix  
  
5.40 The size and mix for open market homes on a development site will typically reflect market 
demand and need.  
  
5.41 On larger schemes it will be expected that a mix of property size to reflect need is provided 
but that a range of floorspace areas within each dwelling size is made available to best 
fulfil affordable housing need.  For instance, it will not be appropriate  that properties are 
provided at the lower end of the floorspace requirements as this will only meet the needs 
of certain family sized groups. As an example, a 3 -bedroom property provided at the lower 
floorspace size threshold will only accommodate a famil y of 4 rather than a family 6 at the  
165 
 higher end of the size threshold. The minimum floorspace requirements for dwellings set 
by the Plan are provided in Policy D5 - Internal Space Standards.  
  
5.42 Given recent changes to planning policy on Housing, and Affordable provision, from 
Government, as well as the need for clear guidance to applicants, the Council may 
subsequently review the Affordable Housing Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) as 
the plan progresses.  
  
 Exception Sites  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
 Rural Exception Sites  
5.43 Rural exception schemes sites can only be used for affordable housing that remains for the 
community in perpetuity. Policy HP6 is intended to address any need for affordable housing 
exception sites should they arise. Based on evidence in the Affordable Housing Strategy 
(2019) on differ ing affordability levels for different affordable products, it will be important 
that any exception site meets a significant proportion of ‘traditional affordable’ need, in 
particular affordable rent products.  
  
 Entry -Level Exception Sites  
5.44 To help facilitate affordable housing need, in particular the need of first -time buyers and 
renters, the NPPF requires Local Planning Authorities to support the development of land 
for housing to provide for entry -level homes, where this need is not being pro vided for 
through existing or planned development. These sites should be outside of, but adjacent 
to, existing urban area boundaries  as identified on the Policies m ap. The expectation is this 
this will enable development on cheaper land, thereby delivering  affordable homes. All 
homes on Entry -Level Exception Sites must be affordable.  
  
5.45 There is a need for a range of affordable tenures. Those households in need of affordable 
rent products (such as Social or Affordable Rent) will typically have fewer h ousing choices 
and are more likely to be living in unsuitable accommodation or officially homeless. With 
this in mind it is important that a range of affordable tenures suitable for first time 
buyers/renters are provided on entry -level exception sites. Thi s way it ensures they reflect 
local need and don’t exclude the needs of those who will be unable to access or afford 
affordable home ownership products.  
  
   Policy H P6: Exception Sites  
 
The development of Rural Exception Sites will  be permitted where:  
 
a) All dwellings are  affordable (as defined in the NPPF) ; and  
b) The affordable delivery is not meeting the affordable housing need  and the 
development is relative in scale to the shortfall ; and  
c) The development is located adjacent to, and w ell related to, the existing urban 
area boundaries; and  
d) The affordable rent products will be brought forward by, and will be managed 
by, a not for profit social housing provider who is regulated by Homes 
England ; and  
e) The affordable housing meets the local needs of the adjacent settlement . 
  
166 
 The development of Entry -Level Exception Sites  suitable for first time buyers (or 
those looking to rent their first home)  will be permitted  where:  
 
i. The site is adjacent to existing settlements;  and 
ii. All dwellings are affordable (as defined in the NPPF) , and a range of 
affordable tenure types, including those that are suitable for first-time renters 
or buyers  are provided ; and  
iii. The site is less than 1 hectare or relative in scale (does not exceed 5% of the  
size of the adjacent settlement); and  
iv. It can be demonstrated, based on an up to date local housing needs 
assessment, that the need for the housing proposed will not be met through 
the allocations in the Plan or development with extant planning permission.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
5.46 Rural Exception Sites help to address crucial affordable housing needs of rural 
communities by enabling the development of small sites that would not normally be used 
for housing. Such sites are specifically for the purposes of providing affordable housing in 
perpetuity.  
  
5.47 To justify a local need, the scheme promoter will need to provide evidence, such as  a 
housing survey. If the survey establishe s a need, as well as meeting the additional policy 
criteria, the policy allows the Council as Local Planning Authority to grant planning 
permission exceptionally for a small development of homes available in perpetuity for those 
who are unable to buy or ren t on the open market.  
  
5.48 Entry -level exception sites must provide affordable housing suitable for first time renters or 
buyers based on low or middle income  households. In line with national policy, the Plan 
supports the development of entry -level exception sites of no larger than 1 hectare or 
where the development would not exceed 5% of the size of the existing settlement that the 
proposed development relate s to, where this need is not being delivered locally, through 
existing commitments or proposed allocations. Where an entry level exception site is 
provided, the applicant should demonstrate that an appropriate mix of affordable housing  
tenures are provide d. This should ideally include some affordable or social rent properties 
to recognise this form of affordable need and not solely forms of affordable home 
ownership.  
  
5.49 It is important that applicants for entry -level exception sites demonstrate that the need for 
such homes is not already being met elsewhere in the Borough, by producing an up to date 
local housing needs assessment. The local needs assessment should provide information 
on the extent to which allocations in the developme nt plan and sites with extant planning 
permission will meet that need.  
  
5.50 In relation to the policy, development proposals will be expected to be designed to take 
account of Policy D1 and of the character of the neighbouring settlement, and, as such 
some limited flexibility on the size of the site or number of homes may be acceptable.  
  
5.51 The affordable housing for Exception sites will be secured in perpetuity through a S106 
agreement . 
  
  
167 
     Policy H P7: Adaptable and Accessible Dwellings  
 
Development proposals for all new dwellings shall provide:  
 
a) At least 15% of all new dwellings at Category 2 standard; and  
b) On schemes of over 100 dwellings (gross), at least 2% of private housing and 
5% of af fordable housing shall be provided as wheelchair accessible Category 
3 properties.  
  
   How this policy works  
  
5.56 Category 2 standard development relates to the categories outlined in Part M (Access to 
and Use of Buildings) of the Building Regulations (2015 edition), which replaces the 
Lifetimes Homes standards. Ensuring a proportion of new homes are provided to this 
standard will increase the quantity of homes in the Borough that are designed in a manner 
whereby they can be more readily adapted to suit the needs of occupants such as the 
elderly or disabled.  To address an identified need the Council expects 2% of mark et 
dwellings and 5% of affordable dwellings to be designed to meet Category 3 (wheelchair 
accessible standards) on schemes of 100 dwellings or more. Appendix 2 of the Specialist  Specialist Housing  
  
5.52 The NPPF requires  Local Planning Authorities to plan for the needs of different groups of 
the community including older people and those with a disability.  
  
5.53 Fareham Borough has an above average population of persons aged 65+. In 2011 20.4% 
of the resident p opulation were aged 65 and over. This compares to 16.3% for England 
and 17.2% for the South East (Census 2011). Based on the 201 8 subnational population 
projections produced by the Office for National Statistics, this proportion of over 65s is set 
to rise to 29. 8% by 203 7 (compared to 23. 4% for England and 25. 1% for the South East). 
Approximately 8.5% of Fareham’s over 65’s live in some form of specialist accommodation 
with the vast majority (approximately 91.5%) living within mainstream housing stock. 
Fareham’s older population is growing according to the national trend, meaning the 
Borough will face increasing pressures over the plan period.  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
5.54 Fareham’s above average aged population means that it is important that more homes are 
constructed at an adaptable standard to give greater choice and the ability for older people 
to remain in their homes should they wish, whilst supporting and encouraging the provision 
of specialist and older person housing when appropriate. In addition, 16% of the resident 
population of the Borough have a long -term health problem or disability indicating that there 
is an increased requirement for specialist accommodation options moving forward.  
  
5.55 The need for more adaptable accommodati on and the level set has been derived from the 
evidence base outlined in the Specialist Housing Background Paper ( September  2020). 
The majority of residents aged 65 and over in the Borough own and live in their own homes. 
Therefore, it is important that th e housing needs for older people maximise the ability for 
individuals to live independently for as long as they are able and wish to do so. There is 
also a need to ensure that the requirements of wheelchair users are met within the 
Borough.  
   
168 
 Housing Background Paper sets out the requirements for Category 2 and 3 of Par t M of 
the Building Regulations.  
  
5.57 The cost to development for providing Category 2 and 3 is relatively minimal. Flexibility for 
additional costs have been factored into the viability evidence base and this indicates that 
the requirements for Category 2 and 3 should have no detrimental impact on the viability 
of schemes in the Borough.  To ensure compliance with the specific standards, the Council 
expects to be provided with plans certified for compliance and/or written confirm ation from 
an appointed building control body that the specifications for each dwelling meet the 
relevant standard. Where necessary, this will be secured through a performance -based 
condition prior to occupation. In instances where a proposal is entirely c onsisting of flatted 
development then it would be expected that the requirements of Policy H P7 should be met 
as far as is reasonably possible before lifts become necessary. This flexibility has regard 
to the viability of schemes and to avoid putting a fina ncial burden specifically on flatted 
development. In some instances, there are likely to be ground floor flats which may be 
capable of meeting policy requirements.  
  
5.58 Where a proposal involves the provision of new dwellings through the conversion of an 
existing building, the policy requirements for adaptable and accessible dwellings will still be 
required, unless it can be sufficiently justified that this is not appropriate or possible. This 
could for example be relevant for the conversi on of listed buildings where meeting the policy 
requirements could compromise the historical integrity of the building, or where the cost of 
doing so renders a building unviable for conversion.  
  
5.59 In the event that the existing Part M Category 2 and 3 definitions are removed from the 
existing Building Regulations, or superseded, then an equivalent should be provided in 
accordance with this standard until such a time as there is an opportunity for policy review.  
  
 Older Persons and Specialist Housing Provision  
  
 Why this policy  is needed  
  
5.60 Although the majority of older people will live in mainstream housing, it is likely that new 
specialist accommodation will be required during the Local Plan period, and such provision 
can help people to downsize and free up family homes for others.  
  
5.61 Further new older person and specialist accommodation will be required during the Local 
Plan period. Such provision can help people to downsize and free up family dwellings for 
others. The precise amount and type of specialist and older person accommodatio n 
required will depend on a range of factors including the choices of individual people and 
households. The Specialist Housing Topic Paper (2020)  outlines some of this need which, 
where possible, has been addressed through specific allocations included in this plan and 
provision for Welborne , which is identified in the Welborne Plan . Further accommodation to 
address identified need will be acceptable in  principle subject to Policy H P8. 
  
5.62 The Specialist Housing Topic Paper (2020) identified that residents in the Borough aged 85 
and over are forecast to experience the greatest level of growth over the plan period with 
an 84% increase anticipated. It is the growth in the size of the 85+ age group which is most 
closely tied to the demand for speciali st forms of accommodation since this age group is 
most likely to need care which is provided in specialist settings.  
   
169 
 5.63 The exact need for all types of older person provision is difficult to quantify as it is influenced 
by choice and other strategies (such as national or county) that seek to reduce the reliance 
on residential or nursing care or to step up the care provided in a person’s own home. It is 
therefore crucial that the Plan provides for new or extensions to older persons and specia list 
housing.  
  
   Policy H P8: Older Persons and Specialist Housing Provision  
 
Development will be permitted  for new, or extensions and additions to existing, 
older persons’  and specialist housing in the Urban A rea boundary where:  
 
a) Sufficient parking and services are available to fulfil the needs of residents, 
visitors and any care and servicing intended to be provided on site; and  
b) Accommodation is provided in sustainable locations having regard  to 
accessibility , local services , community integ ration and safety, and to the 
need for staff and services to access the accommodation; and  
c) An appropriate provision of amenity space is provided having regard to the 
needs of the potential users.  
 
New older persons or specialist housin g shall be provided w ithin the Urban A rea 
boundary unless it can be demonstrated, based on an up to date alternative sites 
assessment provided by the developer, that the need for the housing proposed 
cannot be met elsewhere.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
5.64 Where specialist accommodation is provided, it will be important to ensure that it provides 
residents with a high level of amenity and enables them to live independently as far as 
possible by ensuring it is located close to local services and facilities that are  accessible by 
public transport or walking. There may be instances where housing development at the 
edge of settlements may not be particularly accessible and therefore not appropriate 
locations for specialist and older people housing.  
  
5.65 A robust  up to date alternative needs assessment in the case of schemes promoted outside 
of the urban area will need to be provided  by the developer  to demonstrate that no other 
suitable and available sites exist in the urban area.  Hampshire County Council h as 
published a useful ‘Site Suitability Analysis Tool’ for Extra Care developments so that 
developers are aware of how such schemes will be assessed in terms of location . 
  
 Self and Custom Build Homes  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
5.66 The NPPF states that authorities should plan for a mix of housing to address the need of 
different groups in the community. This includes people wishing to commission or build their 
own homes (paragraph 61 of the NPPF).   
  
5.67 The national requirement for Local Authorities to maintain a register of individuals and 
associations who are seeking to acquire serviced plots of land is contained in the Self -build 
and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015, the Self -build and Custom Housebuildin g (Register)  
170 
 Regulations 2016 and the Self -build and Custom Housebuilding (Time for Compliance and 
Fees) Regulations 2016.  
  
5.68 The need for ‘Self -build’ and ‘Custom build’ homes in the Borough is principally informed by 
the register maintained by Fare ham Borough Council. The Council’s register was first set 
up in March 2016 and provides evidence of the levels of demand for self and custom build 
plots. Further evidence contained in the Self -build and Custom Housebuilding in Fareham 
(2017) paper and the subsequent Self and Custom Build Need Background Paper (2020) 
provides analysis of the assessed need. Future need will continue to be gathered from the 
register and will be monitored through the Council’s Authority Monitoring Report (AMR).  
  
5.69 In order to meet the need identified by Fareham’s Self and Custom Build Register,  in 
addition to supporting the principle of individual self and custom build sites in the urban 
area,  development sites of 40 dwellings or more, will be required to provide for a  proportion 
of suitable serviced plots.  
  
5.70 Policy WEL21 of The Welborne  Plan (2015) requires 1% of all dwellings to be provided for 
self/custom build during the lifetime of the Welborne development. This equates to 60 fully 
serviced self and custom build plots.  
  
5.70.1 It is recognised that individual self and/or custom b uild can form an important source of 
delivery of dwellings  in the Borough and this is supported by the policy.  
  
  Policy H P9: Self and Custom Build Homes  
 
Proposals that provide for self and/or  custom build homes within the Urban A rea 
boundary, as defined on the policies map, will be supported in principle.  
 
On sites of 40 dwellings or more (gross), 10% of the overall dwellings shall be 
provided through the provision of plots for sale to address  local self or custom build 
need.  
 
Such provision shall:  
 
a) be provided as serviced plots; and  
b) ideally be provided in group ed plots; and  
c) ensure design parameters are in place to provide a framework that takes 
account of the existing and emerging built form ; and  
d) ensure design parameters are in place that ensure no significant detrimental 
impact on the amenity of existing, and potential neighbouring, self o r custom 
build plots arises.  
 
Plots which are marketed appropriately but not sold within 12 months of in itial 
promotion, may be developed for housing other than as self and/or custom build 
homes  
 
Sites that appear to have been subdivided for the purposes of application 
submission so as to avoid the 40 dwelling threshold, or sites that feature as part of 
cluster of adjoining development sites, shall be considered cumulatively and if 
progressed on an individual basis 10% of dwellings shall be provided in accordance 
with this policy.   
171 
  
 Where a s ite’s size and density make it unsuitable for self/custom build provision,  
exemption from the policy will be considered on an individual basis . For example , 
flatted development or specialist/older person accommodation.  
  
 
 
 How this policy works  
  
5.71 When the provision of self and custom build plots is to be provided as part of a development 
site the self/custom build provision shall be secured through an appropriate legal 
undertaking which will allow a mechanism for the developer or a third party to provid e and 
facilitate plots. This could include working with a Registered Provider for the provision of 
affordable housing through the self/custom build mechanism (as outlined in the Self -build 
and Custom Housing Building Act 2015).  
  
5.72 Where plots are generally marketed for self and custom build purposes and a period of 12 
months has elapsed from the point at which ‘serviced plots’ are available (available as 
opposed to marketed) without take -up, then any variation through application or  deed of 
variations for alternative housing or other uses will need to be justified with details that 
demonstrate a thorough marketing strategy at an appropriate price has taken place. Unless  
it has been demonstrated that serviced plots have been appropri ately marketed, then 
alternative housing purposes or other uses are unlikely to be found acceptable.  
  
5.73 It is recommended that a marketing strategy for the self -build and custom build homes 
should include an active local marketing campaign including consideration of targeted 
marketing to potential self -builders and local groups, alongside roadside marketing boards. 
An information/marketing pack should also be provided to the Council to be in turn provided 
to all individuals on the Council’s Self and C ustom Build register who have opted to receive 
such information.  
  
5.74 A serviced plot of land24 shall have – 
• Access to a public highway; and  
• Connections to the relevant utilities such as electricity, water and wastewater.  
  
5.75 In addition to the provision of self and custom build dwellings as part of larger housing 
schemes, individual schemes for the redevelopment of an existing dwelling or for the 
provision of further development within the curtilage of an existing dwelling for the purposes 
of self or custom build development shall be supported providing it accords with ot her 
relevant policies of the Loc al Plan.  
  
5.76 There may be instances that other sites are exempt from the requirements of this policy 
where the site size and density make it unsuitable for self/custom build provision. Any such 
instances will be considered on their individual merits.  This could include  high density flatted 
development, or specialist housing provision as an example.  
  
5.77 The self -build need in the Borough is also addressed in  housing allocation HA35 Land east 
of Bye Road which is allocated for 7  dwellings .

 Ancillary Accommodation  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
5.78 This policy sets out the circumstances in which the Council will consider ancillary 
accommodation  to be appropriate. A number of planning applications are received in the 
Borough seeking permission for ancillary accommodation for elderly relatives, older 
children, and staff . Such annexes can provide accommodation for single people or small 
households and can assist in meeting needs for smaller units of accommodation. The 
Council re cognises that ancillary accommodation for elderly relatives, particularly, can help 
to meet social needs whilst reducing pressure on other types of accommodation and reduce 
the pressure on the social care sector. This policy sets out the circumstances in w hich the 
Council will consider ancillary accommodation to be appropriate.   
  
 Policy H P10: Ancillary  Accommodation   
 
The provision of ancillary  accommodation  will be permitted, provided that:  
 
a) It is within the curtilage of the principal dwelling; and  
b) It is proportionate in size  to the principal dwelling; and  
c) It is of a design and structure that is in keeping with the existing dwelling and 
respects the character of the local area ; and  
d) There is no boun dary demarcation or sub -division of curtilage areas between 
the principal  dwelling and ancillary accommodation ; and  
e) Adequate car parking spaces are provided for bot h the residents of the 
principal  dwelling and the ancillary accommodation  within the dwelling 
curtilage, in accordance with the Policy TIN1 . 
  
 How this policy works  
  
5.79 To ensure the accommodation remains ancillary to the principal dwelling it is important that 
the accommodation remains within the curtilage of the principal dwelling. A planning 
condition will be applied to any planning permission to prevent the use of the ancillary 
accommodation as a separate dwelling.   
  
5.80 Planning applications for ancillary accommodation will be assessed on a case -by-case 
basis. However, it is expected that the principal dwelling should  remain larger than the 
ancillary accommodation. Proposals for ancillary accommodation should be sensitive ly 
sited in relation to the principal dwelling to ensure they are not of an intrusive design, and 
do not detract from the character and appearance of the principal dwelling.  
  
5.81 Ancillary accommodation can play an important role in supporting extended families to live 
together with a degree of separation and independence, as well as staff that are functional 
to residents of the principal dwelling. However, they will not necessarily be appropriate for 
accommodation that is separate to , and forms an unrelated unit of accommodation from, 
the principal dwelling.   
   
173 
 5.82 The ancillary accommodation should be in the same ownership as the principal dwelling 
and ensure  that there is appropriate vehicular parking  within the curtilage of the principal 
dwelling . 
  
5.83 Where a proposal concerns an unrelated unit of accommodation that is not ancillary to the 
principal dwelling it will be considered as a new dwelling house, where policies, such as 
whether the property is in the countryside or urban area, will apply.   
  
 Gypsy, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople  Accommodation  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
5.84 The Housing and Planning Act (2016)25 removed the requirement in the Housing Act 2004 
for a separate Gypsy and Traveller assessment and instead included this as part of the 
general assessment of housing needs which includes all people residing in or resorting to 
the borough in caravans or hou seboats. However, the National Planning Policy for Traveller  
Sites (2015)26 (PPTS) still places a requirement on local planning authorities to sustainably 
plan to meet the locally identified needs of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople.  
  
5.85 For the purposes of this policy, Gypsy, Traveller means "Persons of nomadic habit of life 
whatever their race or origin, including such persons who on grounds only of their own or 
their family’s or dependants’ educational or health needs or old age have  ceased to travel 
temporarily, but excluding members of an organised group of travelling showpeople or 
circus people travelling together as such" PPTS Annex 1 Glossary.  
  
5.86 The PPTS also states that in determining whether persons are “gypsies and trav ellers” for 
the purposes of this planning policy, consideration should be given to the following issues 
among other relevant matters:  
 
• Whether they previously led a nomadic habit of life  
• The reasons for ceasing their nomadic habit of life  
• Whether there is an intention of living a nomadic habit of life in the future, and if so, 
how soon and in what circumstances.  
  
5.87 Travelling Showpeople means:  "Members of a group organised for the purposes of holding 
fairs, circuses or shows (whether or not travelling together as such). This includes such 
persons who on the grounds of their own or their family’s or dependants’ more localised 
pattern of trading, educational or health needs or old age  have ceased to travel temporarily, 
but excludes Gypsies and Travellers as defined above" PPTS Annex 1 Glossary.  
  
5.88 At present in the B orough, there are three  private sites for permanent  lawful Gypsies, 
Travellers and one site which has temporary per mission. The combined total of pitches 
lawfully permitted on all of these sites is 11. The temporary site is located withi n Housing 
Allocation HA3  and its temporary lawfu l permission for Gypsy, Travellers is due to expire 
on 9th January 2022. The land is t hen being brought forward for permanent residential 
accommodation for the settled community after the expiry of the temporary lawfu l use.

 5.89 The Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople  Accommodation Assessment (GTAA) for 
Hampshire27 2017, identified a need for 3 additional pitches for those who met the definition 
of Gypsy, Travellers for the period to 2036 in Fareham.  These are expected to be required 
within the next five years , and wi ll be met through the allocation HA4 5. No additional sites 
were promoted to the Council for gypsy and traveller p itches ’. There was no identified need 
for Travelling Showpeople  and no sites were promoted to the Council . The GTAA also 
identified some households who did not meet the current definition of a Gypsy, Traveller. It 
is anticipated that an updated GTAA will be undertaken during the plan period. If there are 
any adjustments in identified need either as a result o f changes in circumstances to the 
households who did not meet the current definition of a Gypsy, Traveller, or the definition 
of a Gypsy, Traveller changes  
itself, or there becomes an identified need for travelling showpeople plots,  then this will be 
addressed through the criteria based part of policy H P11. 
  
 Policy H P11: Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople  
 
Proposals for additional Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople sites will be 
permitted where:  
 
a) There is an identified need and/or personal circumstances necessitate the 
need; and  
b) The site has access to shops, schools, community and health facilities by 
sustainable  modes of transport such as  public transport, on foot or by cycle; 
and 
c) Proposals avoid the loss of mature  trees and do not result in unacceptable 
impacts on biodiversity , the living conditions of residents and on the 
landscape character , historic environment  or the rights of way network 
within the surrounding area; and ;  
d) It is not located in areas at high ris k of flooding; and  
e) It is not located in open countryside away from settlements;  and 
f) Adequate  and appropriately scaled  on-site facilities are provided for parking, 
safe and convenient access to highway, sufficient storage, play and 
residential amenity and a ppropriate essential services (water supply, power, 
drainage, sewage disposal and waste disposal facilities).  
 
Loss of  lawful  Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople sites  
 
Planning permission will not be granted for the loss of lawful Gypsies, Travellers 
and Travelling Showpeople  sites unless there is no genuine need or likely future 
need for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople sites in the locality and 
other policy requirements are met.   
  
 How this policy works  
  
5.90 There is no need for further specific allocations to meet identified needs in the Borough. 
Further requirement  for pitches  as a result of changes in circumstances in households or 
 
27 The Gypsy, Tra veller and Travelling Showpeople Accommodation Assessment (2017) was produced by Opinion 
Research Services on behalf of a Consortium of Hampshire Authorities: Fareham, Gosport, Havant, New Forest, Test 
Valley, Winchester City Councils and the New Forest Na tional Park.   
175 
 planning definitions may  come forward and these will be judged against the ge neric policy 
criteria contained within bullet points a - f of the policy.  
  
5.91 For the purposes of this policy, a “pitch” means a pitch on a “gypsy and traveller” site whilst 
a “plot” would mean a pitch on a “travelling showpeople” site (often called a “yard”). Policy 
HP11 as well as relevant national planning policy guidance, provides the minimum criteria 
requirements which would be expected by any planning application coming forward to meet 
the gypsy and traveller need for Fareham.  
  
5.92 When determining proposals for  additional  traveller sites, the personal circu mstances and 
lack of alternative accommodation for the applicants will be taken into consideration.  
  
5.93 Ensuring safe and sustainable access for Gypsy and Traveller Sites will include considering 
the sustainability criteria set out in Plan ning Policy for Traveller Sites .  The ability to access 
local services and education and health facilities without long distance travel and factors  
such as the provision of pavements to serve the site will be vital to ensure safe pedestrian 
access can be achie ved. 
  
5.94 When considering the impact s to neighbouring residential properties, local amenity, 
landscape quality , trees, woodland and hedgerows  and the  rest of  natural and historic 
environment,  the other policies of this plan together with its supporting evidence will need 
to be taken into account.   
  
5.95 Caravans, mobile homes and park homes are classified as being highly vulnerable to flood 
risk. Therefore sites within Flood Zone 3 will not be  permitted. Sites within Flood Zone 2 will 
be required to satisfy the Sequential and Exception tests before permission is granted. This 
is to ensure that development of Gypsy and Traveller Sites are resilient to the effects of 
climate change and will not a dversely impact the s afety or  quality of life of new residents.  
  
5.96 The provision of a dequate on -site facilities will be considered in the context of the particular 
users . For instance, proposals for Travelling Showpeople are likely to require additional 
provision of space for storage, maintenance of equipment and the parking and manoeuvring 
of vehicles associated with the occupiers. Whilst proposals for Transit sites will  need to 
ensure good access to the road network.   
  
5.97 In order to protect the Borough’s valuable countryside and landscape , proposals for gypsy,  
traveller pitches outside the Urban A rea boundary that have  any permanent built structures 
will be restric ted to small scale structures that are essential for the use of a Gypsy, Traveller 
and Travelling Showpeople site such as day rooms and utility buildings.  
  
5.98 The loss of lawful Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople  sites will not be supported 
unless there is sufficient evidence to suggest there is no current or future need. This is to 
ensure there are sufficient Gypsy, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople sites to meet the 
identified demand within the Borough as dem onstrated in the Gypsy, Traveller and 
Travelling Showpeople Accommodation Assessment (GTAA) for Hampshire 2017.  
  
 Meeting the identified need  
  
5.99 The Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople  Accommodation Assessment (GTAA) for 
Hampshire 2017 found that there was currently no demand for temporary transit sites and 
plots for Travelling Showpeople in Fareham.  However, it identified a need for three further 
Gypsy and Traveller pitches. This  identified need  is to be met through the allocation of land  
176 
 to the rear of 77 Burridge Road in Policy HA4 5, which was promoted to the Council as  part 
of the Local Plan preparation.  
  
5.100 The planning considerations for the site have been informed by a recent appeal 
(APP/A1720/W/18/3209865)  on the site. Whilst the appeal itself concerned the provision of 
a detached 2 storey 4 bedroom dw elling, it highlights the main issues which are still pertinent 
for proposals relating to gypsy traveller pitches. The site currently forms part of   
Site of Importance for Nature (SINC). A SINC evaluation survey was carried out by 
Hampshire Biodiversity In formation Centre in May 2020, the results of which informed the 
location and extent of the allocation. It is recognised that allocation of the site will lead to a 
reduction in SINC habitat. However, the Council has sought to balance the requirement to 
meet  the needs of the Gypsy and traveller community against the ecological constraints on 
the site by locating development on an area that is of lesser quality. In addition to this, it will 
be important that proposals for the site also produce and implement a suitable and fully 
costed Biodiversity Enhancement and Management Plan to protect and enhance the 
remainder of the SINC as well as achieving biodiversity net gain in accordance with Policy 
NE2.  
  
5.101 The other issue that needs to be carefully managed is the impact on the character of the 
surrounding area. The inspector in the recent appeal acknowledged that the surrounding 
character of the area is made up of residential frontages with some backland dev elopment 
consisting of a variety of what appears to be amenity/ancillary buildings. As a result of this, 
it was considered by the inspector in this appeal that the principle of some form of 
development on this site would not have a m aterial adverse impact on the landscape 
character, appearance and function of the countryside providing it was kept in character 
with the area. This is to say that a  two storey dwelling as was proposed as part of the appeal, 
would be "visible behind the caravan and day room in v iews along the driveway, and from 
public vantage points in the vicinity of No 91. The adverse impacts could be mitigated in 
part by landscaping the site, but the backland siting of the proposed dwelling would be 
incongruous causing material harm to the cha racter of the area "28. Therefore, by limiting the 
provision of gypsy traveller pitches on this site to single storey high quality well landscaped 
design, this would ensure that development is in -keeping with the character of the 
surrounding area.

  Solent Breezes Holiday Park  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
5.102 The chalets and mobile homes at Solent Breezes Holiday Park were originally built for 
holiday purposes. However, over the years, a number of the chalets have been used as 
permanent residential homes or as temporary homes rather than for holiday purposes. 
The site is not sustainable due to its location away from local services. Furthermore, 
increased numbers of people living at the site permanently will cause a change to its 
character from one of a holiday park, to a residential housing estate.  
  
5.103 The Council recognises the importance of maintaining Solent Breezes as a holiday park 
for tourism and leisure and it is therefore important to maintain a distinction between 
development within Solent Breezes Holiday Park and residential dwellings.  
  
 Policy H P12: Development Proposals within Solent Breezes Holiday Park  
 
Within the Solent Breezes Holiday Pa rk (as shown on the Policies m ap), planning 
permission or proposals to vary conditions on existing permissions, will not be 
granted to allow the occupation of any existing chalets or caravans on a permanent 
basis. To ensure this, all permissions will be subject to holiday occupancy 
conditions, including maximum occupancy of 10 months in a calendar year. 
Permissions will only be granted for holiday occupation provided all the following 
criteria are met:  
 
a) The holiday accommodation is of a high standard and appropriate for the 
time of yea r proposed to be used; and  
b) It can be demonstrated how the prevention of accommodation for permanent 
residential use will be managed, monitored and enforced, to be agreed 
between the Council and sit e/property owner or operator in advance; and  
c) The submission  of a Coastal Change Vulnerability Assessment that identifies 
that the proposal will result in no increased risk to life or significant increase 
in risk to property . 
  
 How this policy works  
  
5.104 Proposals for developing caravans for holiday accommodation purposes, or the 
conversion of existing properties, or development or intensification of any existing 
development within Solent Breezes, will have a condition restricting occupancy to holiday 
use only and for a maximum of ten months each cale ndar year. These holiday occupancy 
conditions will apply to new holiday accommodation or other forms of development within 
Solent Breezes Holiday Park to ensure consistency with other policy aims of controlling 
development outside the defined urban settlem ent boundaries.  
  
5.105 The accommodation is expected to be of high standard and appropriate to the time of 
proposed use. This is to ensure that the accommodation will not adversely affect the 
quality of life for new residents.  
  
5.106 Potential impacts on the landscape and other nature conservation designations and the 
flood risk areas around the Coastal Zone will be particularly important in determining 
proposals at Solent Breezes Holiday Park.   
179 
   
5.107 Solent Breezes Holiday Park is located within an area identified in the North Solent 
Shoreline Management Plan as having a policy of ‘no active intervention’ and is 
consequently at increased risk of coastal erosion. As a result, any proposals for holiday 
occupation at Solent Breezes will need to provide a Coastal Change Vulnerability 
Assessment to ensure that the proposal will not result in a risk to life or property.  
  
5.108 The Holiday Park is located adjacent to the Solent and Southampton Water, Special 
Protection Area (SPA). As a result, proposals emanating from Solent Breezes have the 
potential to have adverse impacts on the integrity of the SPA. Proposals will be assessed  
in line with  Policy NE3 to ensure that any likely adverse effects are avoided and/or 
appropriately mitigated. Development which would  still have adverse impacts after 
avoidance and mitigation will not be supported.

28 http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/1946157303/report.aspx?town=fareham   Economic Growth   
  
6.1 Building a strong, responsive and competitive economy is a key principle of the NPPF and 
fundamental in helping to deliver sustainable development.  The Council is committed to 
delivering  economic growth, in order to maintain and enhance the Borough’s posi tion as a 
prosperous economic area.  
  
6.2 Fareham has a strong labour market . Labour supply data from nomis28 shows 82% of 
residents  defined as economically active , which is in  exce ss of the Solent  Local Enterprise 
Partnership ( LEP) wide (81%) and national averages  (78%) .  However, since the economic 
recession in 2008 employment growth in Fareham has not kept pace with the Solent LEP 
and national averages – due to a sharper decline in public sector employment combined 
with a lower rate of growth among the private sector.  The policies in this plan aim to redress 
some of the underlying reasons for the slow growth.    
  
6.3 In addition to  supporting existing business to grow and encouraging the formation of new 
businesses, an important element of the sustainab le economic development of the 
Borough is to attract new investment, both in the form of new businesses moving in and 
the investment  in infrastructure such as superfast  broadband  and skills training. The 
Council will work with partners, including the Solent LEP and Hampshire County Council , 
in order to achieve the necessary infrastructure improvements in order to support t he 
economic d evelopment of the B orough.  
  
6.4 In line with the paragraph 81 of the NPPF, it is therefore t he aim of the Local Plan to 
support and facilitate sustainable economic growth  and productivity  across the Borough  
through:  
a. Setting criteria  and identifying strategic sites, for local inward investment to match 
the strategy and to meet anticipated needs over the plan period;  
b. Seek ing to address potential barriers to investment, such as inadequate 
infrastructure, services or housing, or a poor e nvironment; and,  
c. Being f lexible to accommodate needs not anticipated in the plan, allowing for new 
and flexible working practices (such as live -work accommodation), and to enable 
a rapid response to changes in economic circumstances.  
  
6.5 The delivery of this plan is set to commence  at a time when society is adapting to and 
recovering from a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus (COVID 19). As well as serious 
implications for people’s health and the NHS, coronavirus COVID -19 is having a signifi cant 
impact on businesses and the economy.  As the background evidence for this chapter and 
the policies within it was compiled before the pandemic, it would be remiss of the Plan to 
not acknowledge the long-term implications thereof. It is too early to pre dict what the 
implications will be on the local economy in the south Hampshire sub -region, but future 
reviews of the plan will need to take a proactive approach to ensuring the local conditions 
for growth are in place.  
  
6.6 Planning Practice Guidance specifies that the scale of future employment needs requires 
consideration of both quantitative and qualitative need and a breakdown of those future 
needs.  Sectoral and employment forecasts and projections; demographically deriv ed

a robust idea of future needs.  
  
6.7 In June March 2021 2016 , the Partnership for South Hampshire (PfSH) published a Spatial 
Position Statement (SPS) its Economic, Employment and Commercial Need s (including 
logistics) Study  setting out the overall need for and distribution of development in South 
Hampshire, to 20 344029. The Study was commissioned from Stantec  on behalf of the PfSH 
authorities  and is hereon referred to as the Stantec assessment . The statement sets out 
the employment and housing development needed to promote economic growth, jobs and 
homes for all. The evidence base in relation to employment needs was completed in 2015. 
The SPS formed the base of many PfSH authorities' employment r equirements to date but 
is now considered to be out of date and needs replacing. PfSH is committed to reviewing 
the study in 2020/21, but to secure an up to date assessment of employment needs within 
the Borough, an up to date, borough wide assessment was commissioned to support 
development of the local plan. Fareham Borough Council as a member of PfSH considers 
this to provide an update to Tthe Business Needs, Site Assessments and Employment 
Land Study30 which the Council commissioned in 2019  from Lambert Smith Hampton . 
Therefore,  the employment requirements set out in this policy are based on the Stantec  
assessme nt to ensure to provide a more up to date picture of employment need, consistent 
with published sub -regional evidence. takes a balanced approach  to employment space 
requirements , based on  economic growth rates  (including labour supply), business sector 
decline and  historic  employment  floorspace take -up.   
  
6.8 The floorspace requirement identified in Policy E1 , is derived from the Business Needs, 
Site Assessments and Employment Land Study (January 2019) Stantec a ssessment . This 
assessment identified the need  for ‘B-class’ ’Office’ and ‘Industrial’  employment uses  rather 
than specific B1 (office), B2 (industrial) and B8 (wa rehousing and logistics)  employment 
use classes .  The amendment to the national use class es order  made  on 1st September 
2020 (to include a new E class combining commercial, business  and services uses such 
as shops, financial and prof essional services, cafes, offices , research and development,  
clinics and health centres, day centres and gyms ) means that categorising land for  ‘B class’ 
employment uses is no longer appropriate  as a pure B1 use class for  office no longer 
exists. L ikewise , the inclusion o f E class  uses in the allocations  would allow for uses that 
would not normally be considered suitable f or those locations. These were classified in the 
Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) as ;B1: Business - 
includes  offices, research and development premises  (B1b)  and light industrial  B2: 
General industrial B8: Storage and distribution Taking a more flexible approach to uses 
such as industrial and storage and distribution operations is considered suitable given the 
similar nature of site requirements  given that t hey are generally considered uses that 
cannot be carried out in a residential area without detriment to its amenity.  Policy E1 
therefore identifies a requirement for Office and Industrial uses, with site allocation s 
considered flexible for any type of  office, industrial and warehousing/logistics employment 
use for reasons . 
   
 
182 
 
31 The floorspace requirement has been reduced by one year or 6,503 sq.m . to provide a 16 year 
period.  6.9 As from the 1st September 2020, the Use Classes Order was amended to include a new 
Class E. Class E includes all commercial, business and services uses including shops, 
financial and professional services, cafes, offices, research and development, industrial, 
clinics and  health centres, day centres and gyms. This amendment to the use class order 
means that employment uses for ‘B class’ uses is no longer appropriate, and likewise the 
use of E class would allow for uses not wholly suitable for their locations. As such, the 
policies in this Plan will categorise land for; Office, General Industrial and Warehouse and 
Distribution type uses.  
  
6.10 The floorspace requirement  in Policy E1  is based on consistent  an annualised figure of 
1,858 sq. m per annum for Offices and General Industrial, for a combined 3,716 sq.m, and 
2,787 sq. m per annum for Storage or Distribution. As the policies in this plan cover the 
period from 2021 to 2037, the total floorspace requirements are different from that 
identified in the Employment St udy (which covers the period from 2019 to 203631). These 
figures have been calculated based on three factors; a pragmatic estimation of annual take 
up, the available land supply and the additional growth based on sectorial changes. with 
the methodology for undertaking an economic needs assessment as prescribed by the 
Planning Practice Guidance  (PPG) . The guidance requires assessments to consider a 
number of set methods or approaches  to assessing employment requirements:  
• Past Take -up  
• Labour demand (economic forecasts)  
• Labour supply  
  
6.10.1  The Stantec assessment undertook a hy brid assessment of employment need.  For office  
floorspace requirements the need is based on a La bour Demand  model (economic 
forecast)  whereas for industrial it is based on past take -up. The study sets out the reasons 
for doing this and points to the strengths in the industrial market over the past five years 
as a key driver. However, using past take -up for  office need would have  result ed in a 
negative need, and that is neither desirable nor does it align with market conditions. 
Therefore, a positive approach based on labour  demand has been used for office 
requirements, but given the poor recent trend in office development, the requirement within 
the study is considered an aspiration al. This is therefore the case for this policy.  This 
projection of future employment levels and land requirements for the Borough is 
considered the most up  to date and realistic projection as it considers both past trends and 
labour demand as set out in the Planning Practice Guidance.  
  
6.11 The overall requirement  in the Stantec assessment  is for 140,749 sq. m of employment 
floorspace, based on the period 2019 to 2040. The Local Plan covers the period 2021 to 
2037.  Using a pro -rata adjustment to  align  the Stantec assessment to the Local Plan 
timescale  2021 to 2037 ( based on the indicative phasing set ou t in the assessment ) 
reduces the ‘need’ to 121,964  sq.m.  As completions (13,445 sq.m.)  for the years 19/20 
and 20/21  have been below the  suggested requirement  for those years , particularly office 
development,  the Council  feels it is prudent to include the requirement for those years  as 
set out in the Stantec assessment  within the  floorspace  requirement figure so  to reduce 
concerns/criticism regarding the employment floorspace in this Local Plan not addressing

6.12 It is important that Fareham Borough’s plans for an  employment need  that encourages 
economic development through promoting a choice of sites and is flexible enough to cater 
for unforeseen circumstances  is met in order to ensure compliance with as set out in  
chapter 6 of the N ational Planning Policy Framework . By planning for 104,048  sq.m of 
gross employment floorspace between 20 20 and 203 6 (table E2),  t  The Local Plan supply 
contained within the allocations provides for both the quantum of land but also a varied 
mix of site types, size and locations  consider ed necessary to achieve the economic growth 
identified within this policy . This approach towards employment land supply  Policy E1 is 
he Council will be planning for a quantum of floorspace that is consistent with national 
policy and guidance the approach  taken for housing , and allows for some flexibility in 
employment land supply  in order to enhance the choice and variation afforded to 
developers and occupiers.

 Strategic Policy E1: Employment Land Provision  
 
From 20 21 to 203 7, provision of  121,964 104,000 sq. m. of new employment 
floorspace  will be supported , consisting of:    
• 29,700  sq. m. Office  
• 29,700  sq. m. General Industrial . 
• 44,600 sq. m. Storage or Distribution  
 
The following sites, as shown on the Policies map, are allocated for employment 
uses:  
• Faraday Business Park,  Daedalus  
• Swordfish Business Park, Daedalus  
• Solent 2, Whiteley  
• Land North of St Margaret’s roundabout , Titchfield  
• Land at Military Road , Wallington  
• Little Park Farm , Segensworth  West  
• Standard Way , Wallington  
  
  6.12.1  The Stantec assessment confirms  that the recent past trends  in industrial growth  show an 
increase in demand for smaller warehouses and logistics services  including last mile 
delivery .  The requirement for this type of space is included in the overall need for industr ial 
space  identified in table 6. 2. Second guessing logistics in the future is hard, particularly 
given trends associated with the pandemic, but the growth in requirement of this t ype of 
space has a direct influence in the type and number of sites identified as allocations by 
this Plan.   
  
6.12.2  This Local Plan includes a supply of sites to ensure that a sufficient quantum and quality 
of employment sites can be provide d to meet the requirement. The Borough is privileged  
to contain two strategic sites at Welborne and Daedalus that will pro vide high quality, 
attractive employment floorspace for years to come, but the ir size and delivery nature 
means that a significant amount of floorspace is likely to be delivered later in the Plan 
period  or tied up in larger, more complex land  contract  arrangements.  
  
6.13 The Business Needs, Site Assessments and Employment Land Study assess ed the 
potential growth and decrease in employment numbers on a qualitative exercise within the 
Borough, based on knowledge of property requirements and which industry sectors are 
expanding and those in decline. The resulting projections translate into an additional 3,800 
to 4,000 jobs over the three use classes when adjusted to the plan period (250 jobs per 
annum). By comparison, the PfSH  study estimates a target of 6,000 new jobs in total by 
2034 (260 jobs per annum) which whilst desirable, is ambitious and as previously stated, 
caters for a period 7 years longer than this plan.  
  
6.14 This projection of future employment levels and lan d requirements for the Borough is 
considered the most realistic projection of future employment levels and land requirements 
as it considers both past trends and future projections.  
   
 
185 
How this policy works  
  
6.15 The Council’s evidence base for the Borough ’s employment  growth highlight s the need 
to provide a range of modern good quality floorspace to meet  employment forecasts in 
the Borough. The Council is  keen to encourage a  diverse range of  economic growth  and 
this policy will ensure that  the needs of new and growing businesses  are met , and the 
Council  will work with businesses and other partners to ensure th e sufficient supply of 
quality employment  floorspace.  
  
6.16 This strategic policy acknowledges the National Planning Policy Framework's (NPPF) 
approach to building a strong, competitive economy, and the commitment to securing 
economic growth in order to create jobs and prosperity.  By providing a range of types of 
site in different geographical locations suiting different needs, the Plan will ensure that 
both short and long term employment need can be provided for, as well as offering choice 
and flexibility in terms of suitable sites for different uses.  
  
 Employment Allocations  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
6.17 In order to meet the Borough’s employment floorspace requirement, the Council needs 
to identify suitable sites that provide a realistic chance of delivery and provide for flexibility 
and choice. A n assess ment of  the quality and quantum of employment floorspace which 
could be delivered  is contained within the Business Needs, Site Assessments and 
Employment Land Study. From the proposed sites identified in that study , the following 
(table 6. 3) have been identified as suitable to meet the floorspace requirements identified 
in this plan. These sites represent those which are consider ed suitable, available and 
deliverable through the SHELAA process and other technical evidence. These sites will 
form the Employme nt Allocations within this Plan.   
  
6.18 The approach proposed by this Local Plan is to allocate three seven  sites,;  Faraday 
Business Park (Daedalus East), Swordfish Business Park (Daedalus West) , and Solent 
2 Whiteley , Land North of St Margaret’s Roundabout, Land at Military Road Wallington, 
Little Park Farm and Standard Wa y in addition to the employment allocation at Welborne 
secured through the Welborne Plan . Four of those sites (Faraday, Swordfish, Solent 2 
and Little Park Farm) are existing allocations in the adopted  previously identified in Local 
Plan Part 2. The Busin ess Needs, Site Assessments  and Employment Land Study 
concludes that these remain viable and attractive sites and should be considered for 
allocation through this Plan.  In addition to these sites, t The allocation at Welborne (The 
Welborne Plan) will significa ntly contribute to meeting the B orough’s employment need 
but willis  not be allocated within this Plan as The Welborne Plan is not being superseded. 
The Welborne Plan secures 105,000 sq.m of mixed employment uses which are 
considered part of suppl y for the Borough . 85%36 of the Welborne allocation is included 
in the supply in table 6.3 due to the projected phasing of the site.  In addition to these 
sites,, which are enough  to meet the identified requirements,  additional floorspace will be 
delivered through extensions and intensification to the existing employment areas in the 
Borough as set out in Policy E5. Once the sites within this Plan have been completed, 
 
36 Welborne phasing within Plan period as of April 2021   
 
186 
Upon completion, the allocations within this Plan they will then be classed as Existing 
Employment Areas and any subsequent changes of use or redevelopment will need to 
accord with Policy E 5.

6.19 In order to meet the employment land supply figure in Policy E1 , unimplemented 
permissions and outstanding gains  and losses  should  also be counted towards the target 
need figure. As  of July April 20201 (latest available) these stand at 44,460 sq.m. and -
396 sq.m. 4,238 and 3 5,812 sq.m.  respectively.  Table 6. 4 shows how the plan proposes 
to meet the overall employment floorspace through a combination of unimplemented 
permissions, outstanding gains  and losses , and proposed  employment allocations (table 
6.3). This result of this supply mean s that the overall employment floorspace need  in the 
Borough of 121,590 104,000 sq.m  can be met  within the Plan period .  and allow for 
flexibility and choice through a substantial over provision.

6.20 The policies in this  Local Plan secure an overprovision of approximately 121,000 sq.m.  
compared to the requirement identified by the Stantec assessment . Whilst this is a 
significant quantum, it is considered an acceptable approach  to cater for  flexibility and 
choice  in supply both in terms of time and type of employment  space  as set out in the 
NPPF and PPG . To further promote flexibility and choice, alloc ations will be allocated for 
‘employment  use’, allowing the market to determine whether they come forward for office, 
industry or logistics. All Aapplications will be expected to address the site-specific  criteria

 How this policy works  
  
6.21 Daedalus is  a strategic employment site of sub -regional importance, recognised through 
its status as the Solent Enterprise Zone . The site comprises Faraday Business Park, 
Swordfish Business Park and Solent Airport.  Faraday Business Park provides the larger 
offer of a range of unit sizes for advanced manufacturing, both with and without airside 
access. Swordfish Business Park will comprise the second development phase  and is 
proposed to comprise hangars for com mercial aviation businesses and a commercial 
business park .   
  
6.22 The site currently has an outline planning consent for  around  50,000 sq.m across both 
business parks. The masterplan proposals for Faraday Business Park (93,100 sq.m.) and 
Swordfish Business Park (34,100 sq.m.) would see the delivery of around 127,000 sq.m 
of employment space to be achieved.  Approximately 20,000 sq.m of t he total floorspace 
of the whole site is identified as airside hangar space, categorised within the assessment 
as B8 employment use. The Council took  the decision in January 2019 to fund the 
construction of new industrial and business units at Faraday Busi ness Park. The decision 
to appoint a contractor for the development was agreed at the September 2020 Executive  
with practical completion of the units expected in the Summer 2021.   
  
6.23 Solent 2 is located on Rookery Avenue in Whiteley and forms part of the wider Solent 
Business Park (the majority of which is located within Winchester District).  The site is in a 
strategic location next to Junction 9 of the M27 and benefits from an existi ng employment 
allocation within Local Plan Part 2  (2015) .  Planning permission was granted in 2008 for 
23,500 sq.m of office floorspace, which has yet to be built out, however the permission 
remains extant  and the site is undergoing renewed marketing and p romotion for office 
uses .  The Business Needs, Site Assessments and Employment Land Study identifies the 
site as a commercially  attractive site for the proposed Office  or Industrial uses although 
the preference would be for office use . The location with it s access and  congestion 
constraints would make this site less suitable for  warehouse and distribution  uses . 
  
6.24 The allocation policies identify the sites considered suitable, available and deliverable to 
deliver the employment floorspace requirements identified in Policy E1. It is recognised 
that the proposed supply of employment floorspace exceeds the floorspace requirement 
identified , but this is consider ed desirable as it . This allows for flexibility in the delivery of 
sites over the plan period and flexibility for the market should actual take -up be greater 
than that which is anticipated and being planned for. The Ttake-up of sites will be subject 
to re gular monitoring and reporting through the Annual Authority Monitoring Report and 
should monitoring demonstrate that take -up is less than that being planned for, the 
floorspace requirement will be reviewed through the review of the Plan.  
  
6.25 A comprehensive summary of conditions and constraints for each site allocation, together 
with all other promoted or identified sites is available in the Strategic Housing and 
Employment Land Availability Assessment (SHELAA) and should be referred to alongsid e 
the Local Plan.    
   
 
202 
  6.26 The Policies Map shows all site -specific allocations together with other site -specific 
policies of the Local Plan such as urban area boundaries, designated public open space 
and the boundary of Fareham Town Centre.  
  
6.26.1  There are a number of specific points in relation to the allocations which will need to be 
addressed. With regards to the Faraday and Swordfish sites at Daedalus , any 
development will be expected to accord with the Daedalus Vision document. This  is a 
strategic employment site of sub -regional importance and is  recognised through its status 
as the Solent Enterprise Zone .  The site currently has an outline planning consent for 
around 50,000 sq.m across both business parks. The masterplan proposals for F araday 
Business Park (93,100 sq.m.) and Swordfish Business Park (34, 800 sq.m.) would see the 
delivery of around 127,000 sq.m of employment space to be achieved.  Approximately 
20,000 sq.m of the total floorspace of the whole site is identified as airside h angar space, 
categorised within the assessment as B8 employment use.  
  
6.26.2  Solent 2 is located on Rookery Avenue in Whiteley  and forms part of the wider Solent 
Business Park (the majority of which is located within Winchester District).  The site is in a 
strategic location next to Junction 9 of the M27 and benefits from an existing employment 
allocation within Local Plan Part 2  (2015) .  Planning permission was granted in 2008 for 
23,500 sq.m of office floorspace, which has yet to be built out, however the permission 
remains extant  and the site is now undergoing renewed marketing and promotion for 
employment  uses . Any proposals a t this site will be required to demon strate how they are 
compliant with Strategic Policy NE1 w ith regards to impacts on the local ecological network 
in this locality.  Applicants will be required to demonstrate how they will protect existing 
woodland and avoid habitat severance  on site  and include appropriate mitigation and 
compensation for any loss of protected trees.  
  
6.26.3  The sites at Land North of Military Road and Standard Way whilst benefiting from existing 
access to Standard Way  will see a distribution of traffic and increased use of Pinks Hill 
during peak times. Pinks Hill is not adopted public high way and is currently not suitable for 
such an increase in movements. The Highway Authority has recommended improvements 
required to this road  to make the development at these two sites acceptable  and ensure 
that the re is no  detrimental impact on public safety. Therefore, the sites at Land North of 
Military Road and Standard Way will be required to pay a financial contributi on to provide 
the improvements to Pinks Hill  through Po licy TIN2 and TIN4 as recommended by the 
Highway Authority .  
 
203 
  Existing Employment Areas  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
6.27 In addition to new employment floorspace that is required, the Council recognises the need 
to support the Borough’s existing businesses and allow changes in circumstances to be 
supported . This includes the need to secure  modern employment stock to replace 
properties that are reaching the end of their functional life.  
  
6.28 The majority of employment uses are located within the Borough’s allocated Existing 
Employment Areas, which generally provide the infrastructure and facilities required to 
enable their continued role and function. Maintaining a supply of employment land and 
premises is crucial to enhance the economic competitiveness of the Borough and del iver 
sustainable economic growth. Sites within the Employment Areas are particularly valuable 
and the loss of land in these areas to non -employment uses could generate the additional 
pressure for the release of land in less acceptable locations. The Employ ment Areas are 
therefore protected for B Class  uses  and as such the loss of these sites to alternative uses 
will not be acceptable unless the criteria set out in the policy can be satisfied.  
  
6.29 The overall target for new employment floorspace can be met through the proposed 
employment allocations. However, the Council does not want to prevent suitable economic 
development in existing employment  locations which contribute to the local economy. As 
such, the Existing Employment Areas policy enables business in those sites to intensify or 
expand, where appropriate and necessary.  The NPPF states that policy should be flexible 
enough to accommodate needs not anticipated in the plan, and allow for new an d flexible 
working practices, and to enable a rapid response to changes in economic circumstances. 
It is therefore part of this plan to look favourable on applications in existing employment 
areas  in situations where there is no other policy constraint.  
  
 Policy E 5: Existing Employment Areas  
 
The existing Employment Areas (as shown on the Policies map) will be protected 
for existing and new office, general industrial and storage and distribution 
employment uses .  
 
Proposals for the extension of new buildings and intensification of land for 
employment uses within an existing Employment Area will be supported where it 
can be demonstrated that:  
 
a. It would facilitate the creation of additional jobs;  and 
b. The development complies with Policy TIN1 and provid es acceptable levels 
of parking.   
 
Proposals  that will result in the loss of  land and /or buildings to uses other than 
employment within an Existing Employment Area will be permitted where policy 
requirements are demonstrated together with the following:  
 
i. The proposals are not for residential development; and   
 
204 
ii. All appropriate alternative forms of employment  use have been  dismissed 
as unsuitable or unviable ; and 
iii. It can be clearly demonstrated that the land or building is not fit for  purpose 
and modernisation or redevelopment for employment uses would be 
unviable ; and 
iv. The proposals are accompanied by details of marketing of the vacant 
site/building covering a period of not fewer tha n twelve months; and  
v. Where proposals are for 'main town centre uses’39, such as retail and leisure 
facilities, but excluding offices, a full sequential assessment will be required 
as part of a planning application . 
  
 How this policy works  
  
6.30 The re-use, regenerati on and making more efficient use of existing employment land is 
consistent with the principles of ‘sustainable economic growth’. Policy E 5 supports that 
intention by providing the framework to allow the regeneration and rejuvenation o f the 
Borough’s Existing Employment Areas.  The Council  also recognise s that the addition of 
complementary uses within Employment Areas can support the operation and function of 
those areas and can encourage prospective tenants/occupiers to these sites  by improving 
the viability of future  scheme s. 
  
6.31 As shown on the Policy map, the following sites are designated as existing employment 
areas:  
• Furzehall Farm , Wickham Road  
• Kites Croft Business Park , Southampton Road  
• Segensworth  South Industrial Estate , Southampton Road  
• Spurlings Industrial Estate  
• Swanwick Business Park & Oslands Court , Bridge Road  
• Fareham Industrial Estate and Broadcut  
• Castle Trading Estate & Murrills Estate , East Street  
• North Wallington, Standard Way  
• Newgate L ane & Speedfields Park  
• Fort Fareham , Newgate Lane  
• Palmerston Business Park , Newgate Lane  
• Segensworth East Industrial Estate, Brunel Way & Barnes Wallis Road  
• Segensworth West Industrial Estate , Little Park Farm  Road  
• Park Gate Employment Area , Botley Road  
• Park Gate Business Centre , Botley Road  
• Fareham Point , Wickham Road  
• West End (west) , Station Roundabout  
• Boatyard Industrial Estate , Mill Road  
• Funtley Court , Funtley Hill  
• The Tanneries , Titchfield Hill  
• Brook Avenue , Brook Lane  
• Warsash Village Centre , Shore Roa d 
 
39 As defined by the Framework   
 
205 
• Salterns & Delta Business Park , Salterns Lane  
• 242-248 Gosport Road  
• Blackbrook Road Industrial Estate  
• Waterside House , Delme Roundabout  
• Cams Estate , Cams Hill  
• National Air Traffic Services (NATS) , Sopwith Way  
• South of Solent Way, Whiteley  
• High Walls , East Street  
• Castle Court , Castle Street  
• Kiln Acre , Wickham Road  
• Parkway , Wickham Road  
  
6.32 Flexibility is provided to allow, under certain circumstances, the reuse of vacant land or 
buildings in Employment Areas with economic development , as defined by the Framework.  
Where proposals are for 'main town centre uses ’40, such as retail and leisure facilities , but 
excluding offices , a full sequential assessment as set out in paragraph 86 of the NPPF  will 
be required as part of a planning application.  
  
6.33 The redevelopment and change of use aspects of the policy identifies that market 
conditions  will be taken into account when determining applications for a non-employment  
use(s). The Council will require evidence that market conditions indicate that the site is 
unsuitable for future employment uses . Sites will need to have been marketed at a 
reasonable value for at least 12 months (ending within 3 months of the submission of the 
planning application) with no interest from prospective buyers/tenants. In order to establish 
whether the marketing exercise has been satisfactorily comprehensive, applica nts will be 
expected to submit details of the vacancy, the agents used to promote the sale/letting 
(including contact details), advertising methods used, information regarding any interest 
received during that time and why any interest (if any) was not pur sued.  
  
6.34 If the Council receives a proposal that will result in the loss of a property or site in 
employment use that is currently occupied when the proposal is submitted, information 
from the applicant will be required on ; the number of businesses occupying the 
site/premises, the remaining lease length for each of the occupiers, the number of 
employees at the occupiers and evidence that alternative accommodation is available in 
the local area that is suitable for the busine ss to enable them to relocate.  The Council also 
requires applicants to demonstrate that there are strong economic reasons to underpin the 
change of use away from employment uses.  Applicants should consider the following:  
• Whether the proposal would underm ine the function of the Existing E mployment 
Area by negatively impacting upon established neighbouring uses ; and,   
• Whether the proposals would harm the businesses currently established at the site, 
for example by requiring them to relocate (prior to the te rmination of their lease) 
when no suitable alternative accommodation is available in the local area and it can 
be demonstrated that the relocation of the business would impact upon its operation 
and sustainability.

 Waterfront Sites  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
6.35 Paragraph 82 of the NPPF requires policies and decisions to recognise and address the 
specific locational requirements of different sectors. Waterfront sites, including boatyards, 
are of primary importance to supporting the marine and maritime sector in th e Borough  
and wider South Hampshire area .  The importance of waterfront sites to the local economy 
is significant in terms of job creation and in terms of facilitating  boating tourism to the 
Borough.  The strategic importance of boatyards, and particularly  the clusters of them, is 
identified in the Maritime Futures: Solent Waterfront Sites (2015)41 study  and Local 
Industrial Strategy  produced by the Solent LEP.  
  
 Policy E 6: Boatyards  
 
The following e xisting boatyards ( as shown on the Policies map) will be retained 
for marine related employment uses unless it can be demonstrated that such uses 
are no longer financially viable : 
  
a. Eastlands Boatyard, Coal Park Lane, Swanwick  
b. RK Marine, Bridge Road, Swanwick  
c. Swanwick Marina, Bridge Roa d, Swanwick  
d. Universal Marina, Crableck Lane, Sarisbury Green  
e. Stone Pier Yard, Shore Road, Warsash  
f. Wicor Marine, Cranleigh Road, Portchester  
g. Lower Quay, Fareham  
 
The extension and intensification of existing boatyards will be permitted where it 
relates to boat building, repair, maintenance, fitting out or other ancillary uses . 
 
Proposals must demonstrate that they do not cause unacceptable harm to:  
i. safety and ease of navigation on the river or have a detrimental impact on 
the regime of the River Hamble;  and 
ii. public access along or to the coast . 
  
 How this policy works  
  
6.36 The retention of existing boatyards and allowing appropriate and necessary development 
are a key part of ensuring the marine industry continues to thrive in Fareham Borough.  
Such development should be in accordance with other policies in the Local Plan an d 
should not be at the expense of the special landscape c haracter and conservation value 
of the Borough's coastal areas.

Solent Airport  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
6.37 The airfield at Daedalus herein called Solent Airport, is steeped in military history but since 
being decommissioned in 1996 had fallen into disrepair until it was acquired by the public 
sector in the late 2000’s and secured status as one of 24 Enterprise Zones nationally, in 
2011.  
  
6.38 Solent Airport is mainly used for general aviation purposes, and comprises principal and 
secondary runways, taxiways, aprons and a number of buildings. Some of the buildings 
have reached the end of their useful life. Th e broad spectrum of aviation activity includes 
aircraft manufacture, flying schools, helicopter movements, unmanned aerial vehicles 
(UVAs), aircraft maintenance as well as private and commercial flying. Currently, Solent 
Airport has consent for up to 40,00 0 flight movements per year.  
  
6.39 HM Maritime and Coastguard Agency also operates its Search and Rescue helicopter 
service from the site and completed a new training facility in 2015.  The airport has seen 
recent runway improvements, and the airfield has successfully secured an Aerodrome 
license from the Civil Aviation Authority and obtained Border Force approval for overseas 
flights to/from the EU, Isle of Man and Channel Islands  
  
6.40 Fareham Borough Council acquired the site in 2015 and after extensive engagement 
formally adopted the Daedalus ‘Vision and Outline Strategy ’42. The aspiration for the airport 
is for it to become a premier location for aviation, aerospace engineering and advanced 
manufacturing businesses, creating many skilled employment opportunities for local 
people, which is under -pinned by a vibrant and sustai nable airport.  
  
 Policy E7: Solent Airport  
 
The area defined as Solent Airport (as shown on the Policies map) will be retained 
for airport related uses to support aviation activities, unless it can be demonstrated 
that such uses are no longer financially viable.  
 
  
 How this policy works  
  
6.41 To help deliver the vision, this policy will allow the airport to bolster and grow on the existing 
general aviation uses, supporting the airport to become an attractive destination for visiting 
aircraft, offering the hangars, facilities and services to attract more corporate and 
commercial aviation activities, allowing it to be self -sustaining in the medium term and 
contribute positively to the local community.

 Retail and Town /District  Centres  
  
7.1 The Council’s Corporate Strategy includes the priority to “Maintain and extend prosperity 
by working with others to support and promote the economic vitality of the Borough , 
developing and improving vibrant town and district centres offering a range of shopping, 
leisure and employment opportunities”. This is supported in the Local Plan’s vision that 
Fareham Borough will have a strong and diverse economy, with the retention of t he 
Borough’s retail areas  and the strategic priority to “Provide a sustainable and vibrant  future 
for Fareham Town Centre, D istrict Centres and other retail areas, maintaining and 
improving their vitality and viability”.  
  
7.2 This chapter explains  the r etail centre needs in the B orough having considered the 
position now, projections ahead unti l 203 7 and, where appropriate, retail an d leisure 
provision beyond the B orough boundaries.  The policies in this chapter have been 
reviewed in light of  the changes to the use class order41 which c ame into force on 1 st 
September 2020.  
  
 Retail Hierarchy and Protecting the Vitality and Viability of Centres  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
7.3 Town, district and local centres together with smaller parades of shops and services  are 
at the heart of the Borough’s communities and provide the focus for where people live , 
work, shop  and visit. The centres provide vital services  and facilities serving the 
surrounding population  and communities . In line with the NPPF, this policy establishes the 
hierarchy of centres in the Borough  and seeks to  support the continued, and where 
possible improved,  vitality and viability of the B orough’s centres , setting out the hierarchy 
of the centres to encourage the suitable location of shops and services . 
  
 Strategic Policy R1: Retail Hierarchy and Protecting the Vitality and Viability 
of Centres  
 
The retail hierarchy  (as shown on the P olicies map) in Fareham Borough is set out 
in table 7.1. 
 
Where planning permission is required, main town centre uses, as defined in the 
National Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF) , will b e permitted within the defined 
town, district and local centres and s mall p arades  in accordance with the retail 
hierarchy , provided that they : 
• are designed at a scale and character which reflects the role, function  and 
distinctive  qualities of the centre ; and  
• support or improve the centre’s vitality and viability ; and  
• contribute to meeting the identified retail floorspace need in the Borough 
as set out in table 7.2. 
 
Any development that would significantly harm the vitality and viability of a defined 
centre or small parade will not be permitted.  
 
Proposals shall  seek to enhance the vitality and viability of all centres or parades 
by: - 
 
41 https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/757/pdfs/uksi_20200757_en.pdf   
210 
 
 
a. retain ing an active shop window display and offer a direct service to the 
public; and  
b. maximis ing opportunities for the efficient use of upper floors through either 
the conversion to residential use or the provision of other main town centre 
uses ; and  
c. where possible , provide outside tables and seating (including covered 
seating areas) in pedestrianised areas of the town and district centres, 
where appropriately designed.  
 
Changes of use at any of the centres or small parades will be permitted where  any 
proposed increase  in the retail offer provides, or can be served by existing, 
satisfactory parking provision arising from the needs of the proposal.  
 
Proposals that will result in the expansion of existing local centres or parades will 
be permitted providing that the proposal  is of an appropriate scale and physically 
adjacent to the existing centre  or parade  and are in accordance with  the retail 
hierarchy.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
7.4 The retail  hierarchy as set out in table 7.1 identifies  the right type and scale of uses to the 
appropriate centre, so that every day needs are met at a local level and wider needs 
accommodated in the larger centres.  
  
 1. Primary Shopping Area, Fareham 
Town Centre  The town centre serves the Borough as a 
whole, being the main comparison  
shopping destination and is the main focus 
for leisure, entertainment and cultural 
activities.  
2. District Centres – Locks Heath, 
Portchester,  Stubbington,  Welborne  The district centres provide day to day food 
and grocery shopping facilities and non -
retail services serving their local 
communities.  
3. Local Centres - Broadlaw Walk 
(Fareham), Gull Coppice (Whiteley), 
Highlands Road (Fareham), Park 
Gate, Titchfield, Warsash and 
Welborn e 
 The local centres and parades providing a 
basic range of shops, community uses and 
services, meeting the needs of the local 
catchment.  
4. Small Parades - Fareham (Anjou 
Crescent, Arundel Drive, Fairfield 
Avenue, Gosport Road, Greyshott 
Avenue, Miller Drive, Westley 
Grove/Redlands), Hill Head (Crofton 
Lane), Portchester (White Hart 
Lane),  
Sarisbury Green (Barnes Lane, 
Bridge Road), Titchfiel d Common 
(Hunts Pond Road) and Warsash 
(Warsash Road/Dibles Road)  The small parades providing a basic range 
of small shops and services of a local 
nature within walking distance, reducing 
the need to travel by car for everyday 
essentials.  
Table 7.1: The R etail Hi erarchy   
211 
 
  
7.5 The centres are defined on the policies map and the hierarchy of centres underpins the 
town centre first approach, identifying it as the main focus for retail and leisure 
development.  
  
7.6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fareham Town Centre is the dominant town centre in the Borough. To ensure it continues 
to fulfil its role , the majority of  new retail and town centre development will be directed to 
Fareham Town Centre  in line with the Council’s Town Centre Vision 201742. The District 
Centres have an important role serving localised catchments and meeting more local 
needs. To ensure they fulf il this role and continue to complement and support the role of 
Fareham Town Centre new retail and town centre development will also be directed to the 
District Centres. The Local Centres serve smaller catchments and development here will 
be expected to me et the needs of the local area and not adversely impact on the vitality 
or viability of other nearby centres.  
  
7.7 All retail and town centre developments will be expected to be appropriate to the scale, 
role, function and character of the centres in which they are proposed. A sequential 
approach will be used to assess proposals for new retail and town centre developme nt. 
This will help to achieve the spatial strategy for the Borough and will focus development 
on identified centres in the first instance.  
  
7.8 Proposals in Fareham Town Centre which lead to a diverse range of complementary 
evening and night -time uses will be encouraged. Regeneration and redevelopment 
opportunities will be supported that reflect the role and relationships of the centres in the 
Borough’s retail hierarchy. Opportunities to provide further residential development in the 
centres (without undermining the shopping frontages) will be encouraged as residential 
development can play an important role in supporting the vitality of the centres  in the retail 
hierarchy and make a valuable contribution to the Borough’s housing need.  In all 
instances however, the location and provision of residential development should not 
undermine the core functions, and thus the vitality and viability of, the c entres.    
  
7.9 Units that sell hot food, including takeaways, can contribute to the vitality and viability of a 
centre particularly when they are also open during the daytime or are not excessively 
concentrated in one particular frontage. Such uses are most appropriately  located in town, 
district and local centres or small parades.  However, such uses can also cause amenity 
issues due to unreasonable noise, odour  and litter disturbances, due in part to opening 
times and the type of service provided.  Careful consideration will need to be given to 
proposals for hot food takeaway use to ensure that they respect the character of the area, 
protect the amenity of nearb y residents and have appropriate extraction systems. Other 
policies within this plan relating to design and amenity address the majority of these 
considerations.   
  
7.10 The Fareham Retail and Commercial Leisure Study Update (2020 )43 identified the relative 
health of the centr es in the Borough, which have a  vacancy rate  which is broadly 
consistent  with the national average. In 2018 there was a vacancy rate of 8.9% across all 
the town, district, local centres and parades compared to a national average at that time 
of 11.8%. To maintain and improve the health of the centres it is important that the quality 
of these centres is m aintained as this is critical to their success. This policy is intended to 
support the continued function, vitality and viability of the various centres by allowing

flexibility of town centre uses, maximising the use of upper floors and supporting the 
retention of an active street frontage.   
  
7.11 The retail floorspace expectations outlined in the adopted Welborne Plan (2015) have 
been reflected in the hierarchy, with the Welborne  centre being placed as a ‘District Centre’ 
and the village centre being placed as a ‘Local Centre’ in the Borough’s hierarchy of 
centres. The retail, commercial and leisure provision to be provided at Welborne Garden 
Village has been taken into account in  assessing the future needs of the Borough.  
  
7.12 With the exception of the Welborne  district and local centres, which will only be confirmed 
at the detailed planning stage of the proposals for the Welborne site, the boundaries of 
the town, district and local centres and small parades are identified on the Policies Map.  
  
 Future Retail and Leisure Need  
  
7.13 Evidence contained within the Fareham Retail and Commercial Leisure Study Update 
(2020 ) provides projections on the future need for convenience goods retail floorspace, 
comparison goods retail floorspace and food and beverage floorspace projections. Table 
7.2 below presents this need at a Borough wide level. In the case of co nvenience  and food 
and beverag e the need is proportionally  greater i n Fareham Town Centre than the D istrict 
or other centres .

 Table 7.2: Borough Wide Retail Floorspace Projections (sq.m. gross)  
  
7.14 A more detailed breakdown of the need between the Town, District and L ocal Centres is 
provided in Section s 7 and 8  of the Fareham Retail and Commercial Leisure Study Update 
(2020 ). This study also gives further detail on the assumptions of net to gross on 
floorspace projections.  
  
7.15 Vacant floorspace levels44 have the capacity to support the need up until 202 7 and it is 
therefore not essential for specific retail allocations to be identified. Fareham Town Centre 
has recently seen a number of units become vacant and the overall vacancy rate in the 
town increased from 5,345 sq.m to 10,300 sq.m  between 2016 and 2018. Providing 
additional floorspace when there are both large and small vacancies could undermine the 
function of the Primary Shopping Area and as such this approach is not considered 
necessary or appropriate at this time.   
  
 
44 Total vacant floorspace of Fareham Town Centre in 2018 was 10,300 sq.m.   
213 
 
7.16 It is acknowledged that the ne ed for additional floorspace increases in the period 202 7-
2037. However, the findings from the Fareham Retail and Commercial Leisure Study 
Update  (2020 ) recognise that projections beyond 202 7 are less reliable and are based on 
broad directions of growth. With the Government expectation that Local Plans will be 
reviewed more frequently (currently expected to be a requirement every 5 years)45, it is 
considered more appropriate to reconsider the future projected need at  the next Local 
Plan review and  if appropriate, consider the provision for additional floorspace at this time. 
This will allow more reliable projections to be formulated which can  take account of the 
constantly changing role of internet shopping and other economic and market factors.  
  
7.17 The Fareham Retail and Comme rcial Leisure Study Update (2020 ) identified that there 
may be emerging opportunities for commercial leisure uses within the Borough such as 
the potential for a replacement ten pin bowling centre or the introduction of an indoor 
trampoline centre. Together the existing retail floorspace in the Borough, the flexible 
approach to the use of upper floors in t he town centre (which could suit a leisure facility), 
and town centre regeneration opportunities will all provide opportunities for any specific 
needs that may arise should market providers seek to promote such leisure uses in the 
Borough.  
  
 Out-of-Town  Shopping  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
7.18 Out-of-town shopping relates to the existing larger retail warehouse areas that are not 
located within the defined retail centres.  Currently four such areas exist in the Borough, 
which provide an extensive choice of stores and attract customers both from the Borough 
and from surrounding areas;  
• Broadcut, Fareham  
• Speedfields Park (Newgate Lane), Fareham  
• Collingwood Retail Park (Newgate Lane), Fareham  
• Southampton Road, Titchfield  
  
7.19 Stores in these locations tend to accommodate retailers selling bulky goods and are often 
difficult to accommodate in the town and other centres. They provide an important 
contribution toward the Borough’s economy and shopping offer. However, in order to 
ensure that the T own, District and Local Centres retain their vitality and viability, further 
out-of-town retail development will be strictly controlled.  Where an application for a new 
store, an extension to existing store or a change of use is required, i t should be 
accompanied by a sequential test in line with the NPPF.  The Fareham Retail and 
Commercial Leisure Study (2019) recommends that an impact assessment is required for 
any development (over 500 sq.m.) to demonstrate that the proposal will not have  a 
negative impact on any relevant centre.  
  
 Policy R2: Out -of-Town Proposals for Town Centre Uses   
 
Proposals for main town centres uses outside of the Borough’s centres or 
parades46 will be permitted where they can demonstrate there is no significant 
harm, to the centres and parades where : 
 
 
45 Housing White Paper (2017) (DCLG)  
46 The centres and parades as identified in the Retail Hierarchy (Policy R1)   
214 
 
a) the proposal meets a demonstrable need for the use in the proposed location, 
a full sequential test has been carried out demonstrating that there are no 
sites  in the cent res or parades  that are available, suitable or viable;  and 
b) appropriate levels of parking are provided; and  
c) the site is located inside the defined urban area and is accessible, particularly 
by public transport; and  
d) the scale and design of the buildings are appropriate to their surroundings  
in line with Policy D1 ; and  
e) the proposal would not have any unacceptable environment, amenity or 
traffic implications  in line with Policy D2 . 
 
Where a proposal for main town centre  use over 500 sq.m  (gross), or an extension 
which increases overall floorspace beyond 500 sq.m (gross) is proposed outside 
of the defined retail centres, an impact assessment shall be carried out in 
accordance with the NPPF in order to demonstrate that there is no significa nt 
adverse effect on the vitality o r viability of existing or proposed retail centres  and 
parades . 
  
 How this policy works  
  
7.20 A sequential test as set out in the National Planning Practice Guidance47 will be required 
for main town centre use proposals which are located outside of the Borough's centres or 
parades.  
  
7.21 Conditions may be attached to permissions for new out -of-town shopping units to restrict 
the range of goods sold and to control the size of units (including mezzanines). Where an  
application fails to satisfy the sequential test or is likely to have signif icant adverse impact 
on the viability or vitality of the defined centre(s), then proposals will not be supported.   
  
7.22 The policy sets a local threshold for the preparation of impact assessments. This threshold 
is considered necessary as it will enable the Council to monitor and maintain the overall 
vitality and viability of the Borough’s centres which are generally more v ulnerable to 
proposals for edge and/or out -of-centre stores. Applications will be assessed on a case 
by case basis depending on the scale, location and format of the new retail proposals. The 
Council will be pragmatic as to the level of evidence required i n support of such proposals 
as this should be proportionate to the nature of the proposal under consideration.  
  
 Local Shops  
  
7.23 Outside of the defined retail centres and small parades, isolated or local shops provide an 
important and vital service in meeting the day to day needs of communities in the 
immediate area, reducing the need to travel.  The Council will therefore support the 
retention of these shops unless an alternative suitable provision is available nearby which 
meets the day -to-day needs of the local community.  
  
 Policy R3: Local Shops  
 
Outside the defined retail hierarchy, where planning permission is required, the  
change of use of local convenience shops from retail to non -retail uses will be  
 
47 Paragraph s 010 to 018  of NPPG : Ensuring the vitality of town centres   
215 
 
permitted where:  
 
a) There is an existing alternative local shop that can conveniently serve the area48 
or; 
b) The unit has been vacant for a reasonable period of time and rea sonable  
     attempts have been made to let it at an appropriate market value.  
  
The provision of new local shops to meet the day -to-day shopping needs of the  
 local community either within the urban area or in areas of new residential  
development, will be permitted provided that they are of appropriate floorspace 
scale . 
  
 How this policy works  
  
7.24 Planning applications for the loss of isolated convenience shops should be accompanied 
by clear justification to demonstrate why the loss of the particular unit is acceptable. Where 
a local shop has been vacant ‘a reasonable time’ is usually considered to be twelve 
months.  
  
7.25 Local shops are defined as units having a gross floor area of 150 sq.m  or less. Because 
they are intended to serve local needs, developments allowed under this policy must not 
include large, dedicated car parks. Conditions may be attached to planning permissions 
to restrict the range of goods to be sold, to ensure that the s hops continue to serve local 
day-to-day needs, rather than attracting customers travelling some distance.  
  
7.26 The Council encourages the provision of new local shops, especially in areas of new 
development where they are of an appropriate scale so as not to compete with or 
undermine the vitality and viability of nearby retail centres.  
  
 Community and Leisure Facilities  
  
 Why this is policy needed  
  
7.27 The Local Plan has a key role in ensuring community and leisure facilities are maintained 
and improved, and also that there are opportunities for new facilities where there is a need 
in the Borough. The NPPF requires local planning authorities to provide s ocial, 
recreational and cultural facilities and services that communities need and should do so 
through planning positively for the provision and use of shared spaces, community 
facilities and other local services to enhance the sustainability of communiti es and 
residential environments.   
  
7.28 Community facilities make an essential contribution to the health, well -being, and 
education of residents, as recognised in paragraph 92 of the NPPF. Access to community 
and leisure facilities can provide substant ial physical health benefits and can lead to 
improved mental health through increased social interaction. Any growth in jobs and 
homes should be supported by adequate infrastructure provision, which includes 
community and leisure facilities. It is importan t that these facilities and services are locally 
available and accessible to all.  
  
 
48 As set out in the  Accessibility Study  available at: www.fareham.gov.uk/planning/publicationplanevidence.aspx   
216 
 
7.29 The NPPF requires local councils to guard against the unnecessary loss of valued facilities 
and services, particularly where this would reduce the community’s ability to meets its day -
to-day needs, and ensure that established shops, facilities and services are able to 
develop and modernise, and are retained for the benefit of the community.   
  
 Strategic Policy R4: Community and Leisure Facilities  
 
Development proposals for new or extended community and leisure facilities will 
be supported where they meet the following criteria:  
 
a) It is demonstrated that there is a need for the facility that cannot be met by 
existing facilities elsewhere; and  
b) Appropriate consideration has been given to the shared use, re -use and/or 
redevelopment of existing buildings in the local  community ; and  
c) The proposals represent the provision of facilities that are of eq ual or better 
quality and function to existing facilities being replaced ; and  
d) The site is accessible and inclusive to the local communities it serves .  
 
Where proposals for community and leisure facilities are considered to be main 
town centre uses49, and are proposed outside of the identified centres, Policy R2 
shall apply.  
 
Development proposals that would result in the loss of community or publicly 
owned  or managed facilities will be permitted where:  
 
i. The facility is no longer needed ; and  
ii.i. Nno alternative community use of the facility is practical or viable; orand 
iii.ii. Any proposed replacement or improved facilities will be  of 
sufficient equivalent  or better in terms of quality, function and accessibility.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
7.30 A key strategic priority of the Plan is to create places that encourage healthy lifestyles 
through the provision of leisure and cultural facilities, recreation, and open space and the 
opportunity to walk and cycle to destinations. Therefore, in assessing the  location of new 
or replacement facilities, safe and easy accessibility by foot, cycle and public transport will 
be important considerations.  
  
7.31 The definition of community and leisure facilities as included in paragraph 83 of the NPPF 
is wide rangin g and includes:  
• local shops  
• Meeting places  
• Sports venues  
• Open space  
• Cultural buildings  
• Public houses  
• Places of worship  
  
 
49 As defined  in the NPPF   
217 
 
7.32 The Council completed a Community Facilities Needs Assessment50 for each of the 
Community Action Team (CAT) areas in the Borough.  The need assessment resulted in 
the provision of several new and improved community facilities51 for the Borough. This 
assessment has informed the development of the Infrastructure Deliver y Plan which 
supports this Plan. Community Facilities identified by the Council and other service 
providers have been included within the IDP and where applicable (in the case of large 
sites) have been included within site allocation polic iesy. 
  
7.33 Community and leisure facilities may be appropriate in residential areas where they do not 
have a demonstrably harmful impact on the amenities of nearby residential properties and 
other uses in terms of noise and traffic generation, or on the character of the surrounding 
area. Where a new or improved community or leisure facility would cause unacceptable 
impact, for example with regard to neighbouring amenity, which cannot be resolved by 
reasonable measures, the use will not be permitted.  
  
7.34 The Counc il will continue to work with partners and developers to explore opportunities to 
improve or expand upon existing community facilities particularly in instances where 
additional provision is required as identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP),  but 
where it may not be financially viable to provide a new facility. This could take the form of  
small changes to allow for multiple uses of an existing building or more significant additions 
or changes.  
  
7.35 Where edge of centre and out of town centre community and leisure facilities uses are 
proposed that fall within the definition of a ‘town centre’ use, a sequential test will be 
required to assess alternatives in accordance with the NPPF.   
  
7.36 The availability of community run services and facilities are important for the vitality of 
social wellbeing of communities. The loss of such facilities can have severe 
consequences, particularly when there is no alternative provision nearby. However, it i s 
recognised that there may be instances where a community or leisure facility is no longer 
fit for purpose. In such cases applicants will be expected to demonstrate that there is no 
longer a need for the facility in its current location and that alternati ve use is either 
unpractical or unviable.

 Strategic Policy on Climate Change  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
8.1 The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (2017 )51 states how climate change will increase 
risks to human health and well -being, agricultural food production, water resources and 
natural assets in addition to increasing the risks of new and emerging pests and diseases, 
flooding and coastal changes. The Environment Agency recently published a Climate 
Impacts Tool52 based upon UK Climate Projections da ta 2009 which predicts there will be 
on average: 75% more winter rainfall, 59% less summer rainfall, 105% higher peak river 
flows, 1m of sea level rise, an additional 70cm of storm surge and an 11.7oC increase in 
average summer temperatures this century. Fareham is particularly vulnerable to the 
effects of climate change due to its location on the south coast and the many rivers and 
streams that flow through the Borough. It is important therefore, to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions in order to limit the effects of climate change in the future.  
  
8.2 In order for the UK Government to meet its international obligations, the UK Climate Change 
Act 2008 requires the reduction of the nation’s greenhouse g as emissions by 100% (net 
zero) compared to 1990 levels by 205053. In combination with Section 182 of the Planning 
Act (2008)54 and the Planning and Energy Act (2008)55, the need to reduce the nation’s 
emissions was reinforced by the ratification of the Un ited Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change Paris Agreement in November 2016. The Paris Agreement’s central 
aim is to keep global temperature rise this century well below 2oC above pre -industrial levels 
and to pursue efforts to limit the temperatur e increase even further to 1.5oC above pre -
industrial levels.  
  
8.3 The Council as Local Planning Authority has a legal duty to help meet the requirements of 
the Climate Change Act 2008 by ensuring the Local Plan includes policies designed to 
secure that the development and use of land contribute to the mitigation of, and adaption 
to, climate change56.

 Strategic Policy CC1: Climate Change  
 
The Council promotes mitigation and adaptation to climate change through:  
 
a) A development strategy that minimises the need to travel by allocating 
sites and generally directing development to locations with better services 
and facilities, or where they are capable of being improved.  
b) Ensuring allocations in this Plan have taken account of climate change 
through the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment level 1 and 2 and through 
the sequential testing of sites, and the provision of a development 
management policy that ensures applications factor in climate change in 
their flood ri sk assessments.  
c) Integrating Green and Blue  Infrastructure into the design of developments 
through approaches such as mandatory biodiversity net gain which will 
help to reduce CO 2 concentrations and mitigate the urban heat island 
effect, and the use of Sust ainable Drainage Systems which helps reduce 
the risk of flooding.  
d) Adopting higher water efficiency standards to contribute to alleviating 
water stress and consumption across the Borough.  
e) Supporting the reuse and use of sustainably sourced materials and 
supporting the integration of energy efficiency , exceeding Building 
Regulations requirements , renewable and low carbon technologies into 
residential and commercial developments of all sizes.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
8.4 Critical to climate change mitigation is having the right spatial strategy that minimises the 
need to travel by private car and encourages the use of active and public modes of 
transport. The new Local Plan will seek to direct development to those places with better 
services and fac ilities and public transport links.  
  
8.5 There is an increased risk of flooding in the Borough due to climate change and this risk 
has been factored into the choice of site allocations, through the Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment level 1 and 2 and sequential testing report. Flood risk should also be 
factored  into more detailed development proposals and where necessary at the planning 
application stage. Policy CC2  Managing Flood Risk and Sustainable Drainage Systems  
ensures this, and provides opportu nities for mitigation through, for instance Sustainable  
Drainage Systems (SuDS). The policy can also be integrated with wider objectives such 
as to improve blue and green infrastructure and achieve net gains for biodiversity.  
  
8.6 The approach taken in Policy NE 6 Trees, is to maintain and improve tree canopy cover 
in the Borough where appropriate and possible to do so. This approach is not just to  
 
220 
 
improve biodiversity and visual amenity, but to also help offset the ‘urban heat island’ 
effect and pollution issues.  
  
8.7 Parts of the Borough are in areas of water stress from a supply point of view and 
considering the likely future eff ects of climate change, this  Local Plan will adopt higher 
technical standards for water efficiency across the whole Borough.  It also supports the 
aspirations of the water companies in supporting development that achieves even higher 
standards for water efficiency than that set out in  current building regulations.  Policy  D4 
Water Quality and Resources ensures this whilst protecting water quality across the 
Borough, including the Source Protection Zone in Wallington.  
  
8.8 Energy efficiency standards are primarily factored into new buildings through Building 
Regulations . Hhowever, the Council supports development that will exceed Building 
Regulations requirements  such as going above and  beyond the uplift to Building 
Regulations Part L and the n the new  Homes and Building Standards  when introduced , 
attaining net zero carbon  development  where possible.  and/or is consistent with the 
Governments Zero Carbon Buildings policy. The Council also supports development that 
reuses existing materials and/or seeks to use materials that have bee n sustainably 
sourced.  This is covered in Policy D1  Design . 
  
8.9 Designing and constructing developments using low carbon principles  as su pported in 
Policy  D1 Design  can ensure that energy consumption, overheating and the Borough’s 
carbon footprint is reduced. It can also lower the overall costs of running the building for 
the occupants and reduce the need for expensive retrofits later. This would also help 
meet the a spirations of the Government’s Clean Growth Strategy (2017) for all homes to 
be of an Energy Performance Certificate B and C standard by 2035.  
  
8.10 The scope for some types of large -scale renewable and low carbon energy development 
in the Borough is li kely to be limited to areas where it can be adequately accommodated 
within Fareham’s landscape. However, taking a landscape led approach to considering 
development proposals (in line with Policy DS3 Landscape) will be important in 
determining the appropriateness of renewable and low carbon energy development in 
Fareham. There may also be opportunities for decentralised energy and/or heating 
systems to be included as part of developments and these opp ortunities would be 
supported by the Council.  
  
 Flood Risk and Sustainable Drainage Systems  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
8.11 There are areas of the Borough at risk from flooding from a variety of sources such as 
rivers and the sea in addition to local sources of flooding such as surface water. With 
climate  
change, the risks from these types of flooding are likely to be exacerbated. The NPPF 
makes clear that development should be directed away from areas at highest risk of  
 
221 
 
flooding now and in the future.  The Local Plan has been informed by the PUSH Strategic  
Flood Risk Assessment 2016 Update  and the Council’s  Sites Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment  (2020) . 
  
 Policy CC2 : Managing Flood Risk and Sustainable Drainage Systems  
 
Planning permission will be granted where:  
 
a) The proposal meets  the sequential and exception tests as set out in the 
NPPF ; and   
b) The proposal does not prejudice land required for current or future flood 
management, including natural floodplains;  and  
c) The development will be safe over its lifetime, taking into account the 
increased risk of flooding due to climate change and without increasing 
flood risk elsewhere;  and  
d) Any proposed flood protection, prevention and resilience measures 
address the specific  requirements of the site and are appropriate to the 
character and biodiversity of the area ; and  
e) Run-off rates  from  proposed development  do not exceed existing run -off 
rates ; and  
f) Onsite surface water run -off is managed as close to the source as 
possible;  
All d evelopments that  are required to  incorporate Sustainable Drainage Systems 
shall ensure that:  
 
i. They are designed in accordance with the CIRIA C753 SuDs Manual or 
equivalent national or local guidance ; and 
ii. Surface run-off rates mirror greenfield rates b efore development;  and  
iii. Priority is given to SuDS which mimic and reflect natural drainage 
processes;  and; 
iv. Details for future maintenance over the lifetime of the development shall 
be included with the proposal.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
8.12 Sites that could be at risk of flooding57 that are  not allocated in the Local Plan, will need 
to be supported by their own  Sequential Test Assessment. This is because they are not 
covered by the Council’s own Sequential Test Assessment  which has only consi dered 
the allocations in this Plan . 
  
8.13 The aim of the sequential test is to steer new development to areas with the lowest risk 
of flooding. Development should not be permitted if there are reasonably available sites 
 
57 as defined by the Planning Practice Guidance or as stated by the Environment Agency   
 
222 
 
appropriate for the proposed development in areas with a lower risk of floodin g. The 
sequential approach should be used in areas known to be at risk now or in the future 
from any form of flooding.   
  
8.14 If it is not possible for development to be located in zones with a lower risk of flooding 
(taking into account wider sustaina ble development objectives), the exception test may 
have to be applied. The need for the exception test will depend upon the potential 
vulnerability of the site and of the development proposed. A site specific or strategic 
flood risk assessment should info rm the application of the exception test as a result.  
  
8.15 In order for the test to be passed it should be demonstrated that:  
• The development would provide wider sustainability benefits to the community 
that outweigh the flood risk; and  
• The development will be safe for its lifetime taking into account the vulnerability 
of its users, without increasing flood risk elsewhere and where possible, will 
reduce flood risk overall.  
  
8.16 Some minor development and changes of use as stated in paragraph 164 of the NPPF 
are not subject to the sequential or exception tests. However, they should still meet the 
requirements for site -specific flood risk assessments set out below.  
Minor development in relation to flood risk is explained in the Plannin g Practice 
Guidance as meaning:  
• Minor non -residential extensions: industrial/commercial/leisure etc ., extensions 
with a footprint less than 250 square metres.  
• Alterations: development that does not increase the size of buildings e .g. 
alterations to externa l appearance.  
• Householder development: For example; sheds, garages, games rooms etc . 
within the curtilage of the existing dwelling, in addition to physical extensions to 
the existing dwelling itself. This definition excludes any proposed development 
that w ould create a separate dwelling within the curtilage of the existing dwelling 
e.g. subdivision of houses into flats.  
  
 Site-specific Flood Risk Assessments  
  
8.17 A site -specific flood risk assessment should be provided for all development in Flood 
Zones 2 and 3. In Flood Zone 1, an assessment should accompany all proposals 
involving:  
• Sites of 1 hectare or more;  
• Land which has been identified by the Environment Agency as having critical 
drainage problems;  
• Land identified in a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment as being at increased flood 
risk in future or land that may be subject to other sources of flooding  such as 
surface water , where its development would introduce a more vulnerable use.  
   
 
223 
 
8.18 The Environment Agency regularly update the Flood Risk Zones and reference should 
be made to their website.  
  
 Flood Management  
  
8.19 Guidance set out by the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) shall be followed for 
developments in areas in Fareham which have been prioritised as high risk by the 
County wide Local Flood and Water Management Strategy . 
  
8.20 Where possible, natural flood management measures should be employed to reduce 
causes and impa cts of flooding. This will also have the added benefit of helping to 
achieve net gains for biodiversity.  Applicants should ensure that development will be 
safe for the course of its lifetime ; taking into account future climate change projections 
and ensuring that it  will not increase the risk of flooding in other areas.  
  
8.21 In line with the  Lead Local Flood Authority’s (LLFA) Local Flood Risk Management 
Strategy58, it is important that surface water run -off rates from new development do not 
exceed the existing baseline run –off rates for a site.  Surface water should also be 
managed as close to the source as possible.  This is to ensure that there is not an 
increase in runoff entering water bodies  which could pose a  potential  flood risk both to 
the site itself or in other areas .  
  
 Capital Schemes  
  
8.22 The Environment Agency and the Eastern Solent Coastal Partnership (ESCP) have 
developed plans to reduce the risk of flooding particularly along the coastal stretch from 
Portchester Castle and Port Solent. The project inv olves the installation of Defenc es to 
reduce the risk of coastal flooding, designed to a 1 in 200 year standard of protection for 
the next 15 years. However, the implementation of these defences relies on a substantial 
funding contribution which at the time of writing has not been identified.  Future phases 
of the scheme will also be necessary, as the current defenc es will be replaced as they 
reach the end of their useful life.   The aim of this work is to reduce the risk that is posed 
to existing development in these areas. However, it is important to note that the risk from 
flooding will not be removed entirely and a residual risk will remain. Further details about 
coastal defence is presented under Policy CC3. 
  
 Sustainable Drainage Systems  
  
8.23 Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) provide opportunities to reduce the cause and 
impacts of flooding whilst also removing pollutants and provide recreational, amenity 
and wildlife benefits.   
  
 
58 https://documents.hants.gov.uk/flood -water -management/LFRMSdocument.pdf   
 
224 
 
8.24 Whether a SuDS should be considered will depend on the proposed development and 
its location for example whether there are concerns about flooding  both now and in 
future . In particular  however , the NPPF states that all major developments should 
include sustainable drainage systems unless there is clear evi dence that this would be 
inappropriate. The provision of SuDS is  strongly  encouraged for all non -major 
development particularly residential and employment, where it is appropriate  to be 
provided . 
  
8.25 Development proposals should include an indicative drainage strategy to demonstrate 
how surface water disposal is to be dealt with . This should include how sustainable 
drainage will be incorporated into the development  if it is required . This strategy should 
be proportionate to the site and the proposed development  and include provisions for 
long term future maintenance of these systems  as well as any details on agreed step -in 
rights with an appropriate authority if a private management company  fails. Developers 
should consult the Borough Council, Hampshire County Council as LLFA and statutory 
consultee for surface water issues and the Environment Agency as appropriate about 
such proposals .   
  
8.26 SuDS  should be designed in accordance with the CIRIA C753 SuDs Manual59 or 
equivalent national or local guidance  and in consultation with the LLFA (Ham pshire 
County Council) and the C ouncil. In particular, the following destinations must be 
considered for surface runoff in order of preference:  
• Into the ground (infiltration);  
• To a surface water body;  
• To a surface water sewer, highway drain, or another drainage system;  
 
Clear justification for the choice of destination shall be given to ensure the most 
appropriate selection is made.  
  
8.27 Wherever possible, the Council will require Su DS to be as natural as possible and be 
integra ted well within the landscape. This has benefits in terms of providing opportunities  
for biodiversity , particularly  a development’s contribution towards biodiversity net gain 
and ensuring sustainable development . Having naturally designed SuDS  also helps to 
reduce the costs and burden of future maintenance for the lifetime of the development.  
  
8.27.1  SuDS  which  are proposed  as mitigation to ensure  development does  not result in  direct 
water quality impacts on designated sites , may require  additional treatment over and 
above that required for standard discharges.  This would be determined in consultation 
with Natural England.  Applications for development proposing  such SuDS  will need to 
provide a suitable framework  for the in-perpetuity monitoring, maintenance/replacement  
of those SuDS .

225 
 
Coastal Management  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
8.28 Coastal management in Fareham Borough is managed by the Eastern Solent Coastal 
Partnership (ESCP), a partnership of four local authorities60 set up to jointly oversee 
coastal flood and erosion risk across the 162km of coastline from the River Hamble to 
Emsworth , in Chichester Harbour.  
  
 
 
 Figure 8.1: Eastern Solent Coastal Partnership authorities and catchment boundary  
  
8.29 The National Planning Policy Framework requires Local Planning Authorities to reduce 
the risk from coastal change by  “avoiding inappropriate development in vulnerable areas 
or [avoiding] adding to and not exacerbating the impacts of physical changes to the 
coast.” In addition, LPA's should : 
 
• “identify as a Coastal Change Management Area (CCMA), any area likely to be 
affected by physical changes to the coast; and  
• be clear as to what development will be appropriate in such areas and in what 
circumstances; and  
• make provision for development and infrastructure that needs to be relocated 
away from Coastal Change Management Areas." 61 
  
  Policy CC3: Coastal Change Management Areas (C CMAs)  
       
Planning applications for development within the Coastal Change Management 
Area,  as shown on the Policies m ap, will only be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that it will not result in an increased risk to life or to any property.  
This must be demonstrated through the submission of a Coastal Change 
 
60 Fareham Borough Council, Gosport Borough Council. Havant Borough Council and Portsmouth City Council.   
61 National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). (2019). Paragraph 167.  
 
 
226 
 
Vulnera bility Assessment which is proportionate to the scale and cost of the 
development and the level of impact from and to coastal change.  
 
      Proposals for new residential dwellings or for the conversion of existing non -
residential buildings to residential use, will not be permitted in the Coastal 
Change Management Areas set out below:  
 
• Hook Spit to Workman’s Lane; and  
• Hook Park to Meon Shore.  
 
      Any activities that would involve forms of excavation shall be avoided within the 
Hook Park to Meon Shore Coa stal Change Management Area, unless it can be 
demonstrated, through the submission of a Coastal Change Vulnerability 
Assessment that it will not result in an increased risk to life or significantly 
increase the risk to any property.  
 
      Proposals for new or replacement coastal defence schemes will only be 
permitted where it can be demonstrated that the works are consistent with the 
relevant Shoreline Management Plan and that there will be no severe adverse 
impact on the environment,  the English Coast Path, and the rights of way 
network .  
 
      Essential infrastructure that requires a coastal location and/or proposals may 
be permitted provided there are clear plans to manage the impacts of coastal 
change, and it will not have an adve rse impact on rates of coastal change 
elsewhere.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
8.30 For the purposes of this policy, ‘development ’ within Coastal Change Management 
Areas uses the definition contained within the  Town and Country Planning Act  1990  as 
‘the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under 
land, or the making of any material change in the use of any buildings or other land’.  
  
8.31 A Coastal Change Management Area is defined by the NPPF as "an area identified in 
Local Plans as likely to be affected by coastal change (physical change to the shoreline 
through erosion, coastal landslip, permanent inundation or coastal accretion )"62. 
  
8.32 Two CCMAs are des ignated in the Borough and are shown on the Policies m ap.  The 
boundaries of the CCMAs are based on the areas of likely flood inundation and of coastal 
erosion risk. The  designated CCMAs and the justifications for their designations are set 
out in Table 8.1.

 Likely permanent flooding. The CCMA covers 
both 5B03 and 5C01 sections in the North 
Solent Shoreline Management Plan.  No active 
intervention policy identified for part of the 
frontage in the section covered by 5B03.  
Section 5C01 has a policy of no active 
intervention in epoch 1, managed realignment 
policy in epoch 2 and then a hol d the line policy 
in epoch 3. The area has significant nature 
conservation designations (SPA, SAC and 
Ramsar) with potential for environmental 
enhancements such as intertidal habitat 
creation. This could be created through the 
managed realignment process. The area is also 
in a flood plain.

 Coastal Erosion. No active intervention policy 
identified in Shoreline Management Plan across 
all epochs. This is to allow the soft cliffs to erode 
and evolve naturally. This section therefore has 
the greatest potential for coastal change due to 
policy dec ision to allow the rollback of the cliffs. 
There is a localised hold the line policy option for 
maintaining or implementing defences in order to 
protect cross -Solent National Grid operational 
assets whilst the short length of private defences 
at Solent Br eezes may also continue to be 
maintained through permissive development 
rights of private landowners.  
 
A buffer of 200m is added to erosion predictions 
when developing the CCMA.  
 
 Any Mineral extraction activities within this area 
could cause further destabilisation of cliffs.

 Evidence Underpinning Coastal Chan ge Management Area Designations  
  
8.33 A range of evidence documents have been used to identify and justify the designated 
Coastal Change Management Areas (CCMAs) in Fareham, these include:   
 
63 Special Protection Area (SPA) - give protection under the Birds Directive to rare and vulnerable birds, and for regularly 
occurring migratory species.  
64 Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) - given special protection under the European Union's Habitats Dir ective to a variety 
of wild animals, plants and habitats.

8.34 The North Solent Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) forms a key evidence document 
in the designation of the two Coastal Change Management Areas. This document 
provides a large -scale assessment of the risks associated with shoreline evolution, 
coastal flooding  and erosion. It also presents a policy framework to address these risks 
to people and the developed, historic and natural environment in a sustainable manner.  
The SMP provides broad scale assessment of the coastal flooding and erosion risks as 
well as ad vice to operating authorities and private landowners on the management of 
their defences.  
  
8.35 The North Solent SMP policy for the majority of Fareham Borough's coastline is 'Hold 
the Line' apart from the two Coastal Change Management Areas and a section of the 
East bank of the River Hamble which have a Shoreline Management Plan policy of 'No 
Active Intervention and Managed Realignment’ in the first and second epochs'.  
  
8.36 The River Hamble to Portchester Strategy built on the recommendations of the SMP. 
Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategies consider the various options 
available for protecting our coastline and propose management options or flood  
defence sche mes which are economically, socially and environmentally acceptable 
within the constraints which apply to that location.  
  
8.37 Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategies assess the impacts of 
implementing the policies which have been set within the corresponding, high level SMP 
and recommend the most appropriate way for delivering it. They do this by looking at 
much smaller sections of shoreline in much more detail than the SMP and include a 
detailed assessment of the various defence optio ns available.   
  
8.38 The key objectives of such a strategy is to recommend sustainable coastal flood and 
erosion risk management options that;  
• Reduce risk to life,  
• Protect and enhance the population’s well -being,  
• Defend property (residential and commercial),  
• Guard existing infrastructure and;

• To look after and enhance biodiversity, cultural heritage and landscape  
  
 Coastal Change Vulnerability Assessments  
  
8.39 To demonstrate the appropriateness of new development within the CCMAs a Coastal 
Change Vulnerability Assessment would be required. This assessment should be 
appropriate to the degree of risk and the scale, nature and location of the development. 
It should  be able to accord with the requirements in paragraph 168 o f the NPPF in 
demonstrating that the development:  
• Would provide wider sustainabil ity benefits including not impair ing the ability of 
communities and the the natural environment to adapt sustainably to the impacts 
of a changing climate;  
• The character of the coast is not compromised  
• Will be safe over its planned lifetime and not have an unacceptable impact on 
coastal change, without it increasing risk to life or property, or requiring new o r 
improved coastal defences;  and 
• Would not affect the natural balance and stability of the coastline or exacerbate 
the rate of shoreline change to the extent that changes to the coastline are 
increased nearby or elsewhere.  
  
8.40 In addition, the assessment can also consider measures for dealing with the 
development at the end of its planned life. Such measures can include procedures for 
removal.  
  
 Coastal Erosion Mapping  
  
8.41 The National Coastal Erosion Risk Mapping for Fareham71 illustrates the coastal 'erosion 
zone' for Hook Park to Meon Shore as being the area most likely to experience coastal 
change in the Borough. This is because of the existing management policy to 2030 of 
no active intervention in this area, allowing the na tural processes associated with coastal 
erosion to occur. The 'erosion zones' on the map illustrate the area of land predicted to 
be at risk from coastal erosion over 20, 50 and 100 years.  A number of existing 
developments are located within these 'erosio n zones', including the Solent Breezes 
Holiday Village.  
  
8.42 The annual rate of erosion at any point along the shoreline is often unpredictable, 
erosion frequently occurs in single events at particular places rather than in a steady, 
uniform manner.   The area from Hook Park to Meon Shore has potential for sharp sand 
and gravel extraction and is identified as a Mineral Safeguarding Area in the adopted 
Hampshire Minerals and Waste Plan72.  Mineral extraction is an activity that has the 
potential to change the stability of the cliffs and coastline in this location if carried out in

close proximity.   Therefore, a landward 'buffer zone' of 200 metres extending beyond 
the 'erosion zones' is inc luded within this CCMA due to both the unpredictability of the 
rate of erosion and to ensure proper consideration of the possible impacts of any 
proposed mineral extraction is made.   Further work will be needed to identify a rollback 
strategy for Solent Br eezes and those sites closest to the coastline within the site over 
the period of the next 20, 50 and 100 years.  
  
 Coastal Defences outside of the CCMAs  
  
8.43 In line with the Portchester to Emsworth  Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management 
Strategy (EA 2013), the ESCP with the Environment Agency is develop ing plans to 
improve coastal flood defences between Portchester Castle and Port Solent. The design 
of the new defences will provide 1 in 200 year standard of protection for the next 15 
years aim to reduce the risk of from flooding and coastal erosion from the sea in this 
area for the next 100 years. However, the implementation of these defences relies on a 
substantial funding contribution which at t he time of writing has not been identified.  
  
8.44 The ESCP has also produced The River Hamble to Portchester Coastal Strategy 
produced by the Eastern Solent Coastal Partnership73 which covers the 58km (36 mile) 
stretch of coastline from Portchester Castle in the east of the Borough to Burridge on 
the River Hamble in the west of the Borough.  The purpose of this particular Strategy is 
to guide coastal practitioners on the future delivery of coastal management along that 
particular Fareham and Gosport coastline. The strategy has benefits to existing 
development by planning to reduce the risk of coastal flooding in priority areas over the 
next 5 -15 years. However, many of the schemes identified rely on substantial funding 
contributions to be delivered. Even if schemes are delivered, a residual risk of flooding 
in these areas will always remain.  
  
8.45 In some areas of the Fareham coastline the coastal defences are privately maintained, 
such as those at Solent Breezes Holiday Park. The policy position in the North Solent 
Shoreline Management Plan is to allow the private defences, such as those at Solent 
Breezes, to continue to be maintained through permissive development rights of private 
landowners. Any such works would have to have reg ards to the provisions in the Coastal 
Change Management Areas policy and the relevant policies within South Marine Plan74 
as well as other relevant policies within the Local Plan such as the effects on the 
designated sites in the Solent  Special Protection Areas policy.  
  
8.46 Proposals for essential infrastructure and Ministry of Defence installations within Coastal 
Change Management Areas will need to demonstrate that the impacts of coastal change 
on the development can be adequately managed. Proposals s hould also ensure that it

will not have an adverse impact on other parts of the coast through, for example, the 
disruption of coastal processes.  
  
 Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Authorities: Roles and 
Responsibilities  
  
8.47 The following paragraphs provide an outline of the roles and responsibilities of the 
different Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Authorities in England.  
  
8.48 Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra)  
Defra has overall national responsibility for policy on flood and coastal erosion risk 
management (FCERM) in England. The department provides funding for flood risk  
management through grants to the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal 
draina ge boards.  
  
8.49 The Environment Agency (EA)  
The Environment Agency supervises and works with other organisations to manage the 
risk of flooding and coastal erosion in England. It also directly manages flood risk from 
main rivers, the sea and reservoirs. There is however, no legal obligation for the EA to 
undertake these works, and as such, the EA can stop maintaining defences if the cost 
is judged to outweigh the benefits .  
  
8.50 Hampshire County Council (HCC)  
Hampshire County Council is the Lead Local Flood A uthority and has the lead 
operational role in managing the risk of flooding from surface water and groundwater.  
  
8.51 Fareham Borough Council (FBC)  
Fareham Borough Council are a Risk Management Authority and have permissive 
powers to undertake coastal protection and flood defence works but only do so where 
there is a wide public benefit; such as flood risk to life and property. FBC do not have 
responsibility or any legal obligation to maintain defences. FBC do however act to try 
and secure funding and deliver projects where  there are sufficient benefits to the public, 
i.e. when there is a clear economic benefit to developing coastal defence works, when 
there is an appropriate engineering solution that is achievable and where environment 
legislation is not contravened. The Ea stern Solent Coastal Partnership which Fareham 
Borough Council is a member of, provides the functions and responsibilities of the Local 
Authority with regards to flood and coastal erosion risk matters.  
  
8.52 Private Landowners  
Private land owners  and homeowners have ultimate responsibility for protecting their 
own property and land from flooding and erosion and they must act within statutory 
planning regulations and other applicable legislation to do so.  
  
   
 
232 
 
Planned Schemes and Maintenance  
  
8.53 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) August 2020, published alongside this Publication 
Plan, details the infrastructure requirements for future coastal defences. Subject to 
funding the following schemes have been identified in the IDP:  
• Fareham Qua y Coastal Flood and Erosion Risk Management Scheme - To 
protect former landfill and 56 properties at risk from flooding and erosion until 
2060.  
• Harbour View to Cador Drive Coastal Flood and Erosion Risk Management 
Scheme. To protect former landfill and 78 properties at risk from flooding and 
erosion until 2060  
• Managed Realignment / Regulated Tidal Exchange at Hook Lake. This is to 
create intertidal habitat to offset losses elsewhere and allow Hold the Line 
policy of SMP to be implemented across the Solent region. This is being 
investigated as part of  the Regional Habitat Creation Programme.  Funding 
from the EA has been secured to begin progressing the Outline Design Study 
(Hook Lake Coastal Management Study’) . 
  
 Funding   
  
8.54 While the Shoreline Management Plan provides a framework for future decisions, the 
implementation of the policy relies on the availability of funding. A policy of hold the line, 
advance the line or managed realignment does not mean that public funding is s ecured 
or guaranteed for ensuing strategies or schemes.  
  
8.55 In general, where there are large numbers of properties at risk and the benefits of the 
scheme outweigh the costs, schemes are likely to be fully funded. Where there are lower 
numbers of properties at risk and the benefits do not significantly outweigh the  costs, 
schemes may be part grant funded and there will be a need to fund the shortfall to unlock 
the grant element. This can be through a number of sources such as: Regional Flood 
Committee Local Levy, community contributions, Public Funding, Community 
Infrastructure Levy or may be through private developer funding if the works are needed 
in part to protect new development.  
  
8.56 There is limited funding for the ongoing maintenance regime which is generally met by 
Local Authority Budgets and prioritise d using a risk -based approach. An annual 
maintenance programme of works carried out by the Environment Agency is published 
on its website75.

233 
 
 Marine Planning and the Marine Management Organisation  
  
8.57 A new marine planning system was introduced through the Marine and Coastal Access 
Act. The South Marine Plan adopted in 201876, is similar to land use -plans in terms of 
enabling sustainable development however, it covers areas and activities within the 
marine environment such as ports, aggregates, fishing, tidal and offshore wind energy 
and submarine cables. The intertidal zone be tween high water and low water mark is 
where both land and marine planning systems often overlap.  
  
8.58 The Council has a legal Duty to Co -operate and consult with the Marine Management 
Organisation (MMO) in particular when it is determining any planning application where 
there is likely to be an impact on the marine area.  
  
8.59 The South Marine Plan and  its specific policies should be taken into account by any 
potential developer when considering development which has a marine relevance. In 
some cases, additional site -specific assessments may be required to inform proposals. 
Early engagement with the MMO  is advised when appropriate to ensure any impacts 
are promptly addressed. It should be noted however that this is not restricted to 
development in the intertidal zone. For example, a land -based development that affects 
a river may eventually discharge int o the sea and therefore would be covered by this 
requirement.  
  
 Renewable and Low Carbon Energy  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
8.60 It is recognised that increasing the use of renewable and other low carbon technologies 
is a key part of meeting the CO 2 emission reduction targets set by the Government  in 
the Climate Change Act. 2008.  As well as incorporating low and zero energy production 
into the construction of new development, Local Planning Authorities need to encourage 
standalone schemes that contribute to national and regional targets for renewable 
energy production. This includ es the target set in the UK Renewable Energy Strategy 
(2009) for 15% of energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. Low carbon 
technologies are those that significantly reduce emissions (compared to the 
conventional use of fossil fuels).  
  
8.61 The NPPF requires Local Planning Authorities to  support the transition to a low carbon 
future by helping to  shape places in ways that contribute to radical reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions and support ren ewable and low carbon energy and 
associated infras tructure.  Communit y-led initiatives for renewable and low carbon 
energy should also be supported.  This needs to be carried out in ways which ensure 
that any adverse impacts are adequately addressed.

   Policy CC 4: Renewable a nd Low Carbon Energy  
 
Proposals for the delivery of renewable and low carbon energy (excluding wind 
turbines proposals) and the associated infrastructure will be supported 
provided that the there are no adverse impacts on:  
  
a) The character and sensitivity of the surrounding landscape and 
designated landscape features; and  
b) Designated and undesignated heritage assets; and  
c) Ecology, including designated biodiversity and geodiversity sites, priority 
habitat and species and ancient woodland (including veteran trees) and  
the flight paths of birds and bats (where appropriate); and  
d) Water quality and water resources (including groundwater)  
e) The surroundings (including air quality, shadow flicker, waste, odour and 
noise) of local residents and businesses; and  
f) Traffic arising from the construction, decommissioning and maintenance 
of the infrastructure and/or, where appropriate, the transportation of fuel.  
 
Proposals for renewable and low carbon energy requiring mitigation for any 
identified adverse impacts will need to be accom panied by a fully costed 
management and maintenance plan for the lifetime of the development.  
 
Proposals will only be supported where the benefit of the development clearly 
outweighs the harm caused by the development . 
 
All proposals should , where possible, be resilient and ensure they are safe from 
future impacts as a result of climate change by avoiding areas of flood risk  both 
now and in the future.  
 
Proposals for solar energy development should have due regard to the areas 
identified as being least constrained, shown  within the Renewable and Low 
Carbon Energy Study . Proposals outside of these areas will be required to 
provide suitable justification to demonstrate their suitability.  
 
Proposals shall demonstrate that the site will be reinstated to an acceptable use 
appropriate for the area should the development cease to be operational.  
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
235 
 
How this policy works  
  
8.62 The Council commissioned a renewable energy capacity study (produced by Parsons 
Brinckerhoff) in 2013  and has recently produced an update77 to identify the potential for 
types of renewable and low carbon energy in the Borough and the options for policies in 
the emerging Local Pla n. The study also shows that there is good  capacity for solar 
energy in the Borough, but more limited capacity for  other types of technology such as : 
wind energy, hydro -energy, combined heat and power (CHP), biomass and district 
heating. The  study  presented and  assessed some of the main  constraints and 
opportunities for each major type o f renewable and low carbon energ y however  it is 
recommended that  applicants conduct their own studies to ensure their particular type 
of energy development is viable.  
  
8.63 All renewable and low carbon energy proposals will be considered on their individual 
merits with regard to  scale, location, technology type and long -term impacts. Proposals 
with adverse  impacts on quality of life, landscape, wildlife, heritage impacts and traffic 
will not be supported.  
  
8.64 The Borough has a number of areas which are covered by a variety of designations for 
ecology, historic and landscape reasons. Renewable and low carbon energy proposals 
will therefore need to  ensure that there will be no direct and indirect adverse  impacts  
upon these designated sites and assets. In addition, the impact of development on the 
amenity of local residents and businesses must be carefully and adequately assessed. 
In all cases, proposals will be judged against the other relevant policies within the  Local 
Plan including but not limited to: Landscape, Biodiversity, Historic Environment and 
Living Conditions to ensure no adverse  impac ts. 
  
8.65 Where adverse  impact s are identified , these shall be appropriately mitigated . A costed 
management and maintenance  plan for the lifetime of the development would be 
required for mitigation proposals ; particularly those required to make the development 
acceptable under the relevant nature, wildlife and habitats legislation.   
  
8.66 It is recogn ised that there are  opportunities  created  when renewable and carbon energy 
forms  reach the end of their useful life and have to be  decommission ed. It is expect ed 
that once the development ceases to be operational, it should be returned  to an 
acceptable use that is appropriate  for the area. What is appropriate  will be highly 
dependent  on the  site location , known constraints  and what is bein g proposed . However 
acceptable  uses  could  include, wildlife habitat creation , public open space  creation , 
return ing the site  to its former use  or redevelopmen t for residential or employment 
purposes. Proposals for reinstatement will be assessed on a case by case basis , taking 
in to account the other policies  within the Local Plan.  Early engagemen t with the C ouncil 
is strongly re commended.

8.67 The PUSH Solent Energy Strategy was published in January 2015 and refers to a 
number of low carbon schemes within the PUSH a rea, including the use of Newlands 
Farm as a solar farm. The Council approved the installation of the solar farm at 
Newlands in 2013, which has a total installed capacity of approximately 16.87MWe and 
provides electricity to approximately 5,200 households.  Any proposals for solar energy 
outside of  areas identified as ‘least constrained’ on the maps  within the Council's 
updated Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Study  (in appendix B ) will need to provide 
justification for the location in supporting evidence.  Furthermore, the proximity of 
Fareham to Southampton and Solent Airports means that any developers approaching 
the C ouncil with solar PV proposals, should consult with both the aviation bodies and 
the airports themselves to ensure there are no pa rticular issues.  For information about 
the Areas of Least Constraint Map, please see the Council's updated Renewable and 
Low Carbon Energy Study.  
  
8.68 In June 2015, a Ministerial Statement78 was issued stating that planning applications for 
wind energy development involving one or more wind turbines should only be granted 
planning permission where the development site is an area identified as suitable for wind 
energy development in a Local or  Neighbourhood Plan. In addition, following 
consultation it can be demonstrated that the planning impacts identified by affected local 
communities have been fully addressed and therefore the proposal has their backing.  
  
8.69 The Council will not be allocating sites for the development of wind turbines in the Local 
Plan. Therefore, the policy does not relate to wind turbines which will be considered 
against the criteria set out in the Written Ministerial Statement. This plan (including the 
policy abov e) represents the policy framework in which planning applications will be 
considered, should they come forward as a result of a Neighbourhood Plan allocation 
and are supported by local communities.  The Council's updated Renewable and Low 
Carbon Energy Stud y Appendix B  also highlights areas which offer the least constraints 
for wind energy development.

 Nature Conservation , Biodiversity and the Local Ecological Network  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
9.1 An extensive, high quality natural environment is a key part of the environmental pillar of 
sustainable development . There are legal duties placed on Local Authorities with regards 
to biodiversity such as the duty contained within Section 40 of the Natural Environment 
and Rural Communities Act 2006 requiring all public authorities in England and Wales 
to have regard, in the exercise of their functions, to the purpose of conserving 
biodiversity.  The NPPF also amongst other things, sets out the framework for how Local 
Plans should protect and enhance biodiversity  (chapter 15 of the NPPF) .  
 
Protecting and enhancing the natu ral environment can result in a variety of benefits such 
as: 
 
• Allowing people to reconnect with nature and  improv ing people’s quality of life  and 
mental well -being;   
• Support ing and improv ing biodiversity ;  
• Protecting the Borough’s landscape and cultural heritage which helps to create a 
sense of place and identity ;  
• Protecting the Borough’s water resources, such as groundwater reserves, springs 
and rivers ; 
• Provid ing resilience to and mitigat ing the effects of climate change.  
  
9.2 There are a variety of rich and unique habitats which are of high ecological value in and 
around the Borough  some of which are protected by both international and national 
legislation.  There is a hierarchy of designations  which  ranges from internationally 
protected sites  through to national and locally protected  sites.  
  
 International/ European Sites  
  
9.3 The Solent is internationally important for its wildlife with over 90,000 waders and 
wildfowl and 10 to 30 per cent of the global population of Brent Geese. Four Special 
Protection Areas (SPAs) have been designated in the region to protect these important 
bird populations. These are Solent & Southampton Water, Portsmouth Harbour , 
Chichester and Langstone Harbours  and Solent and Dorset Coast . The region is also 
home to a variety of important coastal habitats such as Atlantic Salt Meadows, Smooth 
and Small Co rd-grass and Estuarine Mud Flats amongst others. Two Special Areas of 
Conservation (SACs) to protect these important habitats have also been designated in 
parts of the Solent .  These are Solent Maritime and Solent and Isle of Wight Lagoons.  
  
9.4 Additio nally, the wetland areas of the Solent are designated under the Ramsar 
Convention for their international importance. These include Solent & Southampton 
Water, Portsmouth Harbour and Chichester and Langstone Harbours.  Paragraph 176 of 
the NPPF states that Ramsar sites as well as any potential SPAs and possible SACs 
that are likely to be designated in future  are afforded the same level of protection as 
designated SPAs and SACs  under the NPPF . They should therefore be treated and 
included accordingly.   
  
  
238 
 
 National Sites  
  
9.5 There are also a number of n ationally designated sites within the Borough such as 
Special Sites for Scientific Interest (SSSI) which are also designated for their biodiversity 
or geodiversity values.  National Nature Reserves also fall within this category, 
particularly as many are also SSSIs.  Irreplaceable habitats such as areas of ancient 
woodland and  ancient or veteran trees are also nationally designated features.  
  
 Local Sites   
  
9.6 Locally designated sites in Fareham include  Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SINC)  and Local Nature Reserves . 
  
 All designated areas are shown on the Policies m ap. The hierarchy of nature 
conservation designations is presented in Figure NE1 below:  
  
 Figure 9.1: Hierarchy of UK Nature Conservation Designations  
  
9.7 Within the Borough , there are many other non -designated priority habitats and species 
identified within the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) which are  of important  ecological 
value and should also have proportionate protection. The non-designated habitats as 
well as the designated sites are shown on the Ecological Network Map for the Borough.  
  
9.8 The statutory and non -statutory sites and  habitats  combined, act as coherent ecological 
corridors function ing as an integrated network of ecosystems  making up the Ecological 
Network of the Borough . They also provide various social and economic benefits to the 
residents of Fareham and many help support the internationally designated sites.

9.9 The protection , restoration  and enhancemen t of designated sites and  habitats and 
species that reside within them is important for maintaining a diverse Borough for 
residents to live in and halt the continued loss of biodiversity . Development that takes 
place in Fareham Borough is expected to make a positive contribution to the existing 
natural environment. It is considered that development which does not do this , 
contributes to the continuing decline of biodiversity and would therefore not constitute 
sustainable development.   
  
9.10 Protected sites in general are under pressure from a variety of sources such as climate 
change, air quality and water resources as a result of development proposed in both the 
Borough and across South Hampshire. There is potential for these pressures to ha ve 
significant effects on protected sites. Therefore, an assessment in accordance with the 
Habitats Regulations79, termed a Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) , has been 
undertaken in respect of  the Local Plan to ensure that the implementation of the Loc al 
Plan will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of these sites . 
  
 Strategic Policy NE1: Protection of Nature Conservation, Biodiversity and 
the Local Ecological Network  
 
Development will be permitted where : 
 
a) Designated international , national sites and local sites of nature 
conservation value are protected and enhanced, reflecting their status in  
the hierarchy of nature conservation designations; and  
b) Protected and priority habitats  and species , including breeding and 
foraging areas are protected  and enhanced ; and 
c) Proposals do not prejudice the Ecological Network or result in its 
fragmentation . 
 
Development  within the Borough whose primary objective is to conserve and 
enhance biodiversity (including the Local Ecological N etwork), geodiversity and 
natural resources through restoration, re -creation or management will be 
supported .  
  
 How this policy works  
  
 Protected Sites, Habitats and Species  
  
9.11 The amount of weight given to the protection of an area with biodiversity  interests 
depends upon the hierarchy of nature conservation designations  and the legislation 
through which the site is protected . Protection may apply to the habitat(s)  or species 
concerned , or both . The Council will ensure that any development will be strictly 
controlled in areas of international , national  and local importance following the hierarchy 
of nature conservation. In all cases  except where imperative reasons of overriding public 
interests occur , there is an expectation that development will adhere to the principle s of 
the mitigation hierarchy. This means,  if a development has the potential to harm 
biodiversity  directly or  indirectly, the impact should be avoided ( such as  by finding an 
alternative  site or through appropriate design). If harm cannot be avoided, then adequate 
mitigation, (or as a last resort) compensation  amounting to the lifetime of the 
development  should be arranged.  This mitigation hierarchy is separate from any 
 
79 The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017   
240 
 
consideration unde r the C onservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 .  
Development should demonstrate clearly that the mitigation hierarchy has been 
followed.  
  
9.12 Development impacts directly or indirectly on International/European designated sites 
(SPAs , SACs , Ramsar, pSPAs, pSACs and pRamsar ) are subject to stricter  protection 
tests as set out in the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 . Unless  
there are  Imperative Reasons of Overriding Public Interest , the Council will only agree 
to the project after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of these 
designated sites. This will be achieved through  the Council as competent authority  
conducting an assessment in accordance with the relevant nature, wildlife and h abitats 
legislation. This will determine if the project will have a likely significant effect on the 
sites, and if so, whether it can proceed with adequate measures in place to mitigate any 
of those effects  so as to ensure no adverse effect on the integrit y of those sites.  
  
9.13 Three pathways have been identified where it is known that development is likely to have 
significant effects on the international and European designated sites. These particular 
pathways are covered under Policies NE3, NE4 and NE 5.  
  
9.14 Development on land within or outside a SSSI and which is likely to have an adverse 
effect on it (either individually or cumulatively) will not be permitted unless the benefits 
of the development in the location proposed clearly outweigh both its likely im pact on the 
features of the site that make it of special scientific interest, and any broader impacts on 
the national network of Sites of Special Scientific Interest . 
  
9.15 Development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats (such as 
ancient woodland and ancient or veteran trees) should be refused, unless there are  
reasons of overriding public interests  and a suitable compensation strategy . 
  
9.16 Paragraph 174b of the NPPF states that Plans should promote the conservation and 
enhancement of priority habitats, ecological networks and the protection and recovery of 
priority species. Development proposals within the Borough are therefore expected  to 
contribute to achieving this objective.  
  
 Application Requirements  
  
9.17 Planning a pplications for development must include adequate and proportionate 
information to enable a proper assessment of the implications for biodiversity and 
geodiversity.  Natural England provides guidance to applicants and Local Planning 
Authorities (LPA's) on what potential species/habitat surveys may need to be carried out 
and the relevant supporting ecological information that is required to accompany a 
planning application80. In addition, the Council has a list of Local Information 
Requirements which further supports when applicants should undertake an Ecological 
Assessment81. 
  
9.18 Any assessment must highlight any impacts from development on the natural 
environment as well as demonstrating the mitigation hierarchy has been followed . This 
means  impacts are at first avoided, then mitigated and as a last resort compensated.

81 Fareham Borough Council, Local Information Requirements 
http://www.fareham.gov.uk/planning/applications_and_advice/localrequireddocs.aspx   
241 
 
The need for an assessment and its scope would be discussed at the pre -applic ation 
stage.  Any development proposals that require mitigation and/or compensation 
measures shall be accompanied by a costed management and maintenance plan for the 
lifetime of the development . 
  
9.19 Data searches should be used to inform ecological ass essments accompanying 
development proposals. These can be obtained from the Hampshire Biodiversity 
Information Centre.  
  
9.20 Householder applications relating to roof materials or voids may impact upon roosting 
bats and nesting birds, whilst applications to trees and other vegetation will need to be 
mindful of impacting on nesting birds. Offences in respect of nesting/ roosting birds and 
bats are covered under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. 1981 (as amended).  
  
9.21 It is important to note that whilst some sites may appear to have little or no ecological 
value through a desktop survey, the ecology of a site can be unpredict able and there 
may in fact be some value present on site. As such, the information about the site’s 
ecological status could change through the lifetime of the planning process and further 
information and/or mitigation may be needed in order to determine th e application and 
prevent ecological harm.  
  
 The Local Ecological Network  
  
9.22 The Mapping of the Local Ecological Network (LEN) has been undertaken by the 
Hampshire Biodiversity Information Centre on behalf of the Hampshire Local Nature 
Partnership. The mapping is available through a request to the Hampshire Biodiversity 
Information Centre.  
  
9.23 The effect of the proposed development on components of the LEN must be assessed 
in terms of its proximity, the proposed end use and the impact of the proposed use on it. 
The impacts of any construction activity must also be considered.  
  
9.24 There are several ways in which the impacts to the LEN can be mitigated and 
improvements to it achieved. Advice from an ecologist should be sought to ensure the 
appropriate mitigation/enhancement measures are provided. The LEN mapping contains 
an opportunity area la yer which highlights those areas of the LEN which have the 
potential to be improved or managed in a way that can achieve measured biodiversity 
net gain. The Council has a commitment to securing net gain for biodiversity in line with 
national policy, this i s covered in Policy NE2.  
  
9.25 The Council will use planning conditions and/or obligations to secure appropriate 
enhancement and site management measures. Where impacts are unavoidable, 
mitigation and/or compensation measures will be required. Any development proposals 
that require miti gation and/or compensation measures shall be accompanied by a costed 
management and maintenance plan for the lifetime of the development.  
  
9.26 Development which meets and contributes to the restoration, re -creation or management 
of the LEN  will be sup ported. In addition to the LEN ecological opportunities mapping, 
the Council’s Green Infrastructure Strategy  also provides  some  opportunities for 
enhancements across the Borough.  
   
242 
 
9.27 Frequent updates to the LEN map will show where new connections have been made or 
where opportunity areas have been realised (and have turned from opportunity areas to 
statutory/non statutory habitats.  
  
   Mandating Biodiversity Net Gain  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
9.28 The approach taken towards biodiversity net gain is based upon the emerging legislation 
contained within the Environment Bill, the commitments within The 25 Year Environment 
Plan82 and the guidance contained within the National Planning Practice Guidance, 
Biodiversity Net Gain. Good Practice Principles for Development produced by The 
Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management83 as well as the 
responses from Natural England to the various stages that led to the formulation of this 
Local Plan .  
  
9.29 The Council will seek to halt the loss of biodiversity and provide net gains across the 
Borough. In line with  the emerging Environm ent Bill and  national policy the Council 
expects development proposals to achieve demonstrable net gains in biodiversity.  This 
can be secured through incorporating and enhancing existing wildlife habitats into 
development and encouraging the inclusion of further biodiversity enhancements as part 
of the design. It is Important to recognise that biodiversity net gain should be additional 
to any habitat creation required to mitigate or compensate for impacts particularly those 
involving irreplaceable habitats . Any mitigation and/or compensation requirements for 
international/ European sites will be dealt with separately under either policy NE1  NE3, 
NE4 and NE5 . 
  
9.30 This policy does not apply to land contained within the Welborne Plan.  
  
 Policy NE2: Biodiversity Net Gain  
 
The development of one or more dwelling or a new commercial/leisure building 
should provide at least 10% net gain for biodiversity  for the lifetime of the 
development .  
  
 How this policy works  
  
9.31 Measures  for biodiversity net gain  can include but  are not limited to, green walls/roofs 
and Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), providing woodland, ponds, wildflower 
areas, nesting and roosting features. They could form part of a broader package of 
measures desi gned to improve or mitigate the wider impacts of development or help to 
deliver overall environmental gains . Almost any development can achieve some level of 
biodiversity net gain. Any measures used to achieve net gain should be accompanied 
by a costed management and maintenance plan to ensure gains remain in place.  
  
9.32 The Council expects Biodiversity Net Gain provision for applications  for development of 
one or more at least every net new dwelling or  commercial building  (including

243 
 
redevelopment)  to be able to provide  some  net gains . This includes those on brownfield 
sites subject to the exemption tests which is set out below. This is in recognition that 
Biodiversity Net Gain can also be provided offsite where it is demonstrated that  it cannot 
be adequately accommodated onsite. Small er wildlife f eatures such as bat boxes and 
swift bricks could be included as part of a wider biodiversity enhancement and mitigation 
plan, separate to biodiversity net gain commitments . relatively small features  such as  
incorporating  wildflower meadows,  ‘swift bricks’ and bat boxes in developments and 
providing safe routes for hedgehogs between different areas of habitat  can often achieve 
important benefits for wildlife.   
  
9.33 However, in line with the Government’s respo nse to the Defra consultation on 
biodiversity net g ain, there will be a targeted exemption for brownfield sites that in 
particular, meet a number of criteria including that they can clearly demonstrate to the 
Council that they:  
• Do not contain any priority  habitats84; and  
• Face genuine difficulties in delivering viable development.  
  
9.34 In line with the Government’s respons e to the Defra consultation on b iodiversity net gain, 
permitted development and householder applications such as extensions are also 
exempt from the mandatory requirement for providing net gains for biodiversity.  
  
9.35 A biodiversity calculation tool, such as the Defra Biodiversity Metric85 , should  be used 
to assess and demonstrate that a biodiversity net gain outcome can be achieved. Such 
a biodiversity metric enables the calculation of losses and gains by assessing a habitat’s 
distinctiveness, condition and extent. These factors are translated into a score which is 
presented in biodiversity units. Special multipliers are also used to account for risks in 
delivering habitat creation or enhancement. To achieve net gain, a development must 
have a sufficiently higher biodiversity unit score after development than before 
development .  
  
9.36 A minimum  figure of 10% above the existing biodiversity baseline is to be used  to ensure 
measurable improvements to biodiversity.  This figure has been chosen to be in line with 
the emerging Environment Bill86. A Biodiversity Gain P lan or a Biodiversity Mitigation and 
Enhancement Plan should be submitted to the Council alongside the planning 
application  which demonstrates that a 10% gain in biodiversity value is being achieved 
through development and how it is to be maintained/ managed. E vidence and rationale 
supplied by applicants in r espect of biodiversity net gain should be supported by 
appropriate scientific expertise and local wildlife knowledge.  Planning conditions and/or 
obligations may be used to ensure that a planning permission provides for works that 
will measurably increase b iodiversity.   
  
9.37 In some instances w here it has been agreed that Biodiversity Metric calculations and the 
requirement for 10% net biodiversity gain will not be applied due to very low ecological 
baseline value  (such as proposals for a single dwellin g), it will still be expected to 
demonstrate general biodiversity enhancements by provision of , for example,  integral 
bat roosting features and integral bird nesting features. This is in -line with the 
NPPF  Guidance (July 2019  para. 23) which refers to Swift Bricks and bat boxes.

principles -and-governance -bill-2018/environment -bill-summer -policy -statement -july-2019    
244 
 
9.38 There should also be provision made for the ongoing management and mainte nance of 
habitats to ensure net gain is delivered and achieved in the short and long term.  It is also 
important that measures for biodiversity net gain are resilient to pressures from further 
development and climate change. The emerging Environment Bill  as well as the  
Government  response  to the Defra consultation on biodiversity net gain suggest s that 
net gains should be maintained for a minimum of 30 years. Therefore, the Council would 
expect a costed management and maintenance plan for habitats created for biodiversity 
net gain to include enough funding to last for a minimum period of 30 years. H owever, it 
is recognised that sometimes, a 30 year minimum can amount to funding in perpetuity if 
the funds are invested prudently. As a result, the aim should always be to have wildlife 
and nature protected and maintained for the life -time of the developm ent with which it is 
associated.  
  
9.39 The Council expects biodiversity net gain to be provided on -site in the first instance. 
However, where it can be shown that biodiversity net gain cannot be adequately 
achieved on-site, either a combination of on -site and off -site measures or entirely  off-site 
measures are acceptable. Off -site measures should  be made  in reasonabl e proximity to 
the development as far as possible. This is to ensure that habitats do not become 
fragmented and the occupiers of the new  development and surrounding residents are 
able to benefit from the ecosystem services that being close to nature provides. Early 
discussions with the Council’s ecologist is encouraged to ensure biodiversity net gain is 
achieved.  
  
9.40 The use of the Local Ecological Network Map can be an effective  way to identify 
opportunity areas to achieve credible net gains. It can also ensure that creation is in a 
location where it can contribute to the wider ecological network and reduce habitat 
fragmentation. A map of the Local Ecological Network is presented  in Appendix C  of the 
Local Plan. Consulting the databases held within the Local  Environmental Record 
Centre87 could also provide useful baseline biodiversity information. This can help to 
target specific biodiversity enhancements for any protected or priority species and 
habitats that maybe near to the development, therefore delivering biodiversity net gain.  
  
9.41 The use of ‘habitat banks '88  to secure off -site gains  away from the development  can also 
be considered if net gains cannot be effectively provided in the vicinity of the 
development.  Discussions with local wildlife organisations can help to identify 
appropriate solutions. Using a biodiversity metric can also be used to assess whether a 
biodiversity net gain outcome is e xpected to be achieved on a particular parcel of land.  
  
9.42 There are several measures that can be integrated into development which can also 
deliver wider environmental gains enabling the Borough to mitigate the potential future 
effects of climate cha nge, water/air quality and flooding. Such examples are green roofs 
which in addition to enhancing biodiversity, absorb rainfall, improve the performance of 
the building, reduce the urban heat island effect and can improve the appearance of a 
development.  
  
9.43 Using the baseline biodiversity value (score) of a site and comparing this to the future 
biodiversity value with the development (score) can be used to calculate the uplift in 
biodiversity value. This information can be drawn out from the Biodiversity Metr ic 2.0 that

88 Such as the Environment Bank https://www.environmentbank.com/    
245 
 
will be submitted by applicants to demonstrate that they have achieved at least 10% net 
gains for biodiversity.  
  
9.44 The Council may prepare and adopt further detailed guidance in the form of a 
Supplementary Planning Document to assist the determination of planning applications 
in accordance with this policy . 
  
 Recreational Disturbance on the Solent Special Protection Areas  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
9.45 The Council is part of the Solent Recreation Mitigation Partnership (SRMP)  referred from 
now on as Bird Aware Solent, which is formed of the Pf SH authorities as well as Natural 
England, the RSPB, Hampshire & Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust and Chichester Harbour 
Conservancy. The Council has worked proac tively with the partnership  to produce , 
identify and implement a programme of mitigation measures which form part of a 
Mitigation Strategy to cou nteract the likely significant effect s of recreational disturbance , 
(either alone or in -combination ) associated  with residential development  within a 5.6km 
zone of influence on  the Solent SPAs  (Solent & Southampton Water, Portsmouth 
Harbour Chichester and Langstone Harbours  and Solent and Dorset Coast) . In-
combination  effects occur where one development considered on its own would not 
result in a likely significant effect on the Solent SPAs, but  when assessing the impacts 
alongside other dev elopments occurring in the B orough and surrounding areas , there  
would  exist a likely significant  effect.  
  
9.46 Development p roposals resulting in a net increase in residential units  will need to 
demonstrate that the negative effects can be avoided or mitigated , or they must  
contribute towards the strategic mitigation measures put in place by Bird Aware Solent.  
Some  other types of development (such as new hotels, student accommodation, care 
homes  and camping and caravan sites ) may also need to address recreational 
disturbance impacts, both alone and in -combination. Such development will be assessed 
on a case by case basis.  
  
 Policy NE3: Recreational Disturbance on the Solent Special Protection 
Areas (SPAs)  
 
Planning permission for proposals resulting in a net increase in residential units 
will be permitted where a financial contribution is made towards the Solent 
Recreation Mitigation Strategy.  
 
In the absence of a financial contribution toward s the Solent  Recreation 
Mitigation  Strategy , proposals  will need  to avoid or mitigate  any ‘in combination’ 
negative effects  from recreation  through a developer -provided package of 
measures  for the lifetime of the development . 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
246 
 
How this policy works 
  
9.47 The strategic measures set out in the Bird Aware Solent Recreation Mitigation Strategy 
(SRMS)89 require a financial contribution to be made for each residential dwelling built 
within 5.6km of the boundary of the Solent SPA.  This 5.6km buffer encompasses the 
whole of Fareham Borough and is the identified zone o f influence for recreational 
disturbance on the Solent  SPAs. This financial contribution covers the quantum of 
mitigation needed for the development to avoid having an adverse effect on the 
surrounding SPAs. However, some proposals by nature of their size and/or proximity to 
the coast may have additional effects on the Solent SPAs. As a result, these types of 
development may require additional site -specific mitigation but will be determined on a 
case by case basis.  
  
9.48 It is expected that the majority of schemes will mitigate their effects by payment of a 
contribution. The scale of the financial contribution is based on the number of net 
additional dwellings, and the number of bedrooms per dwelling. These figures will be  
updated on the 1 st of April each year in line with the Retail Price Index. Further 
information on the SRMS can be found on the Council’s or Bird Aware Solent website90.  
  
9.49 Development proposals which chose not to  pay the  financial contribution in a ccordance 
with the SRMS will have to demonstrate that an alternative package of mitigation 
measures, separate from the SRMS, would satisfactorily mitigate the adverse effects 
from recreational disturbance on the Solent SPAs. This should be carried out in 
consultation with Natural England.  
  
 Eutrophication in the designated sites in the Solent area  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
9.50 New housing schemes and other proposals which includes a net gain in overnight 
accommodation necessitates the provision of new connections to t he foul water drainage 
network. This causes an increase in the amount of sewage influent at W astewater 
Treatment  Works (WwTW). Waste water from Fareham  discharges into Peel Common  
WwTW which enters the Solent via a long sea outfall. The increase in wastewater effluent 
from Peel Common both individually and cumulatively with other WwTWs could cause 
nutrient enrichment and is likely to lead to significant effects on  the internationally 
designated  sites in Solent. If a significant effect from new development an d other 
proposals which include  a net gain in overnight accommodation on the  internationally 
designated  sites in Solent  is likely, then mitigation will  need to be provided  before 
planning permission can be granted.  
  
 Policy NE4 : Water Quality Effects on the Special Protection Areas (SPAs), 
Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Ramsar Sites of the Solent.  
 
Planning permission will be granted where the integrity of the designated sites is 
maintained, having regard to the effect of nutrients on the designated sites 
arising from increased wastewater production.

Strategy/pdf/Solent_Recreation_Mitigation_Strategy.pdf   
90 https://www.birdaware.org/   
247 
 
 How this policy works  
  
9.51 All new development  that would result in a net gain in overnight accommodation  which 
is likely to  have  a significant effect on designated sites through increased wastewater 
production will need to provide a Nutrient Budget.  Natural England have produced advice 
on achieving  nutrient  neutrality for new development resulting in an increase in overnight 
accommodation in the Solent Reg ion. There is a non -technical summary91 and a more 
detailed guidance document92. It is recommended that applicants  read this guidance 
to ascertain  if their development needs to  demonstrate  nutrient neutrality  or not.   
  
9.52 Unless there are Imperative Reasons of Overriding Public Interest , the Council will only 
agree to the project after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity 
of the designated sites  in the Solent . This will be achieved through  the Council as 
competent authority  conducting an assessment in accordance with the relevant nature, 
wildlife and habitats legislation.  This will determine if the project will have a likely 
significant effect on the sites, and if so, whether it can proceed with adequate measures 
in place to mitigate any of those  effects  so as to ensure no adverse effect on the integrity 
of those sites. To demonstrate that adequate measures are in place for development to 
achieve nutrient neutrality, the Council  recommends  using the Natural England 
methodology calculator and accompanying mitigation  guidance93.  
  
9.53 Proposals that require a mitigation package in order to be nutrient neutral shall be 
accompanied by a costed management and maintenance plan for th e lifetime of the 
development.  to ensure no likely significant effects. They should be accompanied by an 
appropriate management and monitoring framework.  
  
9.54 When the designated sites are in an unfavourable condition as a result of eutrophication, 
development proposals should be expected to provide a net reduction such that they 
can contribute to the objective or restoring the condition to favourable . 
  
 Solent Waders and Brent Geese   
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
9.55 Fareham is an internationally important wintering location for protected Brent Geese and 
Wading Bird species, with the Fareham coast designated as a Solent Special Protection 
Area (SPA) as a result.  The Solent Wader and Brent G oose  (SWBG)94 Strategy explains 
that Brent  Geese and Waders (SPA Birds) are also dependent on a network of habitats 
which provide feeding and roosting opportunities outside of the SPA boundaries. These 
‘supporting sites’ are the areas shown as Core, Primary, Secondary or Low Use in Policy 
NE5 and on the Policies m ap. There is another category of site where the importance is 
not fully known (due to limited survey data), these areas are classed as ‘Candidate’ in 
Policy NE 5. At present, there are no Candidate Sites within the Borough however , this 
could change with future updates to the Solent Wader and Brent G oose  Strategy, and 
if/when new data records emerge to show an area as a possible Candidate for Brent 
Geese and Waders.

9.56 The known supporting sites of value have been defined and iden tified in the S WBG 
Strategy after much surveying and data collection . The Strategy sets out more detail as 
to which sites are the most valuable and why.  Ongoing survey work may result in 
amendments to the network of sites and the policy shall alway s apply to the latest 
Policies m ap as updated or superseded.  
  
9.57 The identified supporting sites are key to the functional integrity of the designated  Solent 
SPAs . As a resu lt, any adverse impact  on these supporting habitats has the potential to 
be detrimental to the overall integrity of the surrounding Solent SPA s. Development that 
adversely affects a n SPA or its supporting habitat sites  will not be permitted . Any 
potential impact would require an assessme nt in accordance with the relevant nature, 
wildlife and habitats legislation.  
  
 Policy NE5: Solent Wader and Brent Goose Sites  
 
Sites which are used by Solent Waders and/or Brent Geese (as shown on the 
Policies map) will be protected from adverse impacts commensurate to their 
status in the hierarchy of  the Solent Wader and Brent Geese Network .  
 
Core and Primary Support  Areas  
Development on ‘ Core and Primary Support Areas’ (as shown on the Policies 
map) will only  be permitted  where:   
 
a) The proposal has avoided or adequately mitigated impacts on -site and there 
is an overall net gain  to the Solent Wader and Brent Geese Network ; or 
 
b) Where it can be clearly demonstrated that criteria a is not feasible or 
practicable , a suitable, readily available replacement site which conforms 
entirely to the specific requirements for the Solent Waders and Brent Geese 
species concerned and is satisfa ctorily agreed by the Council and other 
appropriate bodies is provided and secured for the lifetime of the 
development .  
 
Secondary Support Areas  
Development on ‘ Secondary Support Areas’ (as shown on the Policies map) will 
only be permitted where either:  
c) Adequate o n-site mitigation is provided; or  
d) A suitable replacement habitat is provided on a like for like basis broadly 
close to the site; or  
e) Where it can be demonstrated that compliance with either criteria c and d is 
not appropriate, a smaller suitable habitat replacement area is agreed and 
secured in perpetuity through a costed Habitat Management and Monitoring 
Plan and a financial contribution (consistent with the approach taken to 
mitigating and off -setting adverse effects on the Sole nt Wader and Brent 
Geese Network) is provided towards a suitable identified site for Solent 
Waders and Brent Geese.   
 
Low Use  
Development on Low Use Sites (as shown on the Policies map) will only be 
permitted where:  
f) On site mitigation is provided which is agreed by the Council ; or  
249 
 
g) Where it can be demonstrated that criteria f is not appropriate , off-site 
enhancement and/or  a financial contribution (consistent with the approach 
taken to mitigating and off -setting adverse effects on the Solent Wader 
and Brent Geese Network)  is provided towards a suitable identified site for 
Solent Waders and Brent Geese.  
 
Candidate Sites  
Development on Candidate Sites (as shown on the Policies map) will only be 
permitted where:  
h) Consecutive survey s are  undertaken to determine the classification of the 
site; and  the above requirements are met according to the status of the site 
which must first be established and agreed with the Council.  
 
Indirect effects  
Indirect effects to a Solent Wader and Brent Gees e site from development 
proposals shall be avoided or (where this not feasible or practicable)  a suitable 
package of mitigation measures should be agreed and secured.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
9.58 Development impacts  (including direct and indirect)  on all the identified supporting sites 
for Solent Waders and Brent Geese will  be assessed  on a case by case basis, however 
all impacts should be avoided in the first instance , where possible .  
  
9.59 Where required, a suitable program me of mitigation measures will be sought which 
should be proportionate to the value attributed to the identified Solent Wader and Brent 
Geese site . Proposed m itigation  should be  consistent with the measures set out in the 
SWBG  Strategy Guidance on Mitigation and Off -setting Requirements95 or any 
subsequent mitigation strategy produced . All mitigation measures proposed, should be 
agreed i n consultation with the Council. M embers of the Solent Wader and Brent Geese 
Steering Group96 may also be consulted to ensure measures will be effective in 
preserving the Solent Wader and Brent Geese Network . The Network should be 
protected and where possible, enhanced to achieve biodiversity net gain. Development 
proposals that directly or cumulat ively impact on supporting sites and do not provide 
mitigation or compensation will be refused.  
  
9.60 Development proposals on Solent Wader and Brent Geese  sites will require an 
assessment in accordance with the relevant nature, wildlife and habitats legislation to 
determine the level of impact alone and in combination with other plans and projects. 
Information to enable the Council to undertake the assessmen t will need to be provided 
as part of the planning application to demonstrate that there would be no likely significant 
effects arising from the development. If required, a further detailed assessment will also 
need to be undertaken to conform to the requi rements of relevant nature, wildlife and 
habitats legislation.

96 Steering Group Members include: Natural England, Hampshire and Isle  of Wight Wildlife Trust, The Royal Society for 
the Protection of Birds, Hampshire County Council and the Eastern Solent Coastal Partnership.   
250 
 
 Indirect Effects  
  
9.61 There is potential for new development on land adjacent to or in close proximity to Solent 
Wader and Brent Geese sites to impact on the continued ecological function of the 
network. Indirect effects may arise from increased recreational pressure and access to 
sensitive sites; overshadowing and lighting from new buildings; or noise and visual 
disturbance from con struction work on land adjacent to sensitive sites. These activities 
and the presence of built form may reduce the functional area of a site available to 
roosting and foraging SPA Birds.  
  
9.62 Appropriate mitigation will be required where new development or changes to access 
and management has the potential to adversely impact the function of the ecological 
network. Detailed consideration will need to be given to the design and layout of new 
development adjacent to sites used by SPA birds to en sure there is no disturbance. 
Consideration should be given to potential impacts from new walking and cycling routes, 
access to open space, over -shadowing from built development and lighting. In the first 
instance, consideration should be given to avoidanc e measures, following which 
bespoke mitigation should be proposed.  The level of mitigation necessary will be 
determined on a case by case basis  in consultation with the Council and members of the 
Solent Wader and Brent Geese Steering Group such as Natural England.  
  
 Replacement Habitats and their Management  
  
9.63 Where replacement habitat is required in accordance with policy NE5, the replacement 
land shall be located as close as possible to the site being adversely affected; unless in 
consultation with the Council, it has been determined to not be feasible or appr opriate. 
The replacement site must be provided upfront and already be managed in a suitable 
condition for waders and/or Brent Geese prior to the loss or damage to the site proposed 
for development. It is expected that the land is owned or leased by a Non -Government 
Organisation (NGO) partner and with an agreed and costed Habitat Management and 
Monitoring Plan with sufficient funds provided to cover the costs in full, for the lifetime of 
the associated development . The long -term funding should be secured for  all 
replacement habitat to provide an endowment whereby i t is used for on -going 
maintenance. This approach would secure the long -term funds required to mitigate for 
the lifetime of development . It is expected that applicants proposing mitigation for the 
Solent Wader and Brent Geese  network consult with the Council’s Ecologist  and other 
appropriate bodies such as Natural England  to ensure that mitigation of any impacts is 
satisfactorily accounted for.  
  
 Core Areas  
  
9.64 Core Areas are considered essential to the continued function of the Solent Wader and 
Brent Geese network. This is because they have the strongest functional linkage to the 
designated Solent SPAs in terms of their frequency and continued use by Solent waders 
and Brent Ge ese. Therefore, unmitigated loss of a Core Area will not be permitted due 
to the negative impact this would have on the Solent SPAs.  
  
9.65 It is considered difficult to replace Core Areas as there is limited availability for alternative 
sites in close proximity to the SPA. The options for off -setting will be considered on a 
case by case basis and will be subject to maintaining in full or grea ter, the continued 
ecological function and providing net gain benefits to the Solent Wader and Brent Geese  
network. The replacement habitat must have a freehold or long -term lease (in  
251 
 
perpetuity97) and must be passed to an appropriate conservation body or the Council in 
a suitable condition and managed in perpetuity as a nature reserve for Wader and/or 
Brent Geese.  
  
 Primary Support Areas  
  
9.66 Primary Support Areas are important to the continued function of the Solent Wader and 
Brent Geese network. These areas can, when under suitable management, support 
similar numbers of birds or fulfil a similar ecological function to a Core Area. Therefore, 
like Core Areas, the unmitigated loss of a Primary Support Area will not be permitted due 
to the negative impact this would have on the Solent SPAs and Solent Wader and Brent 
Geese network.  
  
9.67 The loss or damage to a Primary Support Area from development is only acceptable 
where such loss or damage is either adequately avoided or mitigated onsite or replaced. 
The options for replacement will be considered on a case by case basis and will be 
subject to maintaining the continued ecological function and providing net gain benefits 
to the Solent Wader and Brent Geese network. This should be achieved through the 
creation and on -going management of a suitable, readily available replacement habitat. 
A replacement habitat may be either:  
 
• A new site(s) identified as being suitable to fulfil the same or greater contribution 
and ecological function, for the same species of bird(s), to that of the area being 
lost or damaged; or  
• An existing site(s) that if brought into better/more appropriate condition can fulfil 
the same or greater contribution and ecological function, for the same species of 
bird(s), to that of the area being lost or damaged . 
  
9.68 An early assessment of viable offsetting replacement ha bitats, along with how the 
necessary management can be secured and delivered upfront, will need to be 
undertaken. The assessment will need to demonstrate how the proposed replacement 
habitat will clearly meet the requirements of Solent Waders and Brent Gee se species.  
  
9.69 It is considered difficult to replace Primary Support Areas as there are limited 
opportunities available for alternative sites close to the SPAs.  
  
 Secondary Support Areas  
  
9.70 Secondary Support Areas ensure a geographical spread of sites available to Solent 
Waders and Brent Geese, offering a supporting function to the Core and Primary Support 
Areas. Although these sites are generally used less frequently by significant numbers of 
Solent Waders and Brent Geese, they become important when the habitat is suitably 
managed, and when the bird populations are higher due to large numbers of juvenile 
birds.  
  
9.71 The loss of or damage to a Secondary Support Area will be refused unless appropriate 
mitigation measures are secured. The preferred approach is to avoid and /or mitigate 
the impact onsite in the first instance. However, where this cannot be adequately 
achieved, then a n offset through the provision of a suitable replacement habitat on a like 
 
97 The term in perpetuity relating to SW&BG sites is defined in the SWBG Guidance on Mitigation and Off -setting 
Requirements as being a minimum of 80 years.   
252 
 
for like basis to that being lost or damaged shall be secured in perpetuity. The 
replacement site shall be provided as close to the site that is being lost where possible. 
However, as Secondary Support Areas are generally utilised less frequently than Core 
Areas or Primary Support Areas it may be acceptable in some cases for the replacement 
habitat to be located at a greater distance from the original site. However, this will be 
asse ssed on a case by case basis and in consultation with the Council and members of 
the Solent Wader and Brent Geese  Steering Group  where appropriate . 
  
9.72 If the replacement habitat is to be provided on a smaller scale than that being lost, then 
the applicant will also need to provide a financial contribution consistent with that set out 
in the SWBG Strategy Guidance on Mitigation and Off -setting Requirement s or any 
subsequent mitigation strategy produced,  in addition to the replacement habitat being 
proposed. The financial contribution will be used for the management and enhancement  
of an agreed suitable identified site for Solent Wader and Brent Geese.  
  
 Low Use Sites  
  
9.73 Low Use Sites have the potential to be used by and support the Solent Wader and Brent 
Geese  network. As such, the in -combination loss of these sites would impact on the 
continued ecological function of the network.  
  
9.74 For development proposals of all kinds, proportionate mitigation, enhancement and/or 
offsetting will be required. Measures  should avoid an d/or adequately mitigate the impact 
of development on site in the first instance. However, where it is demonstrated that this 
is not practical or feasible, off -site options and / or a financial contribution for mitigation 
should be consider ed. The applicant will need to provide a financial contribution 
consistent with that set out in the SWBG Strategy  Guidance on Mitigation and Off -setting 
Requirements  or any subsequent mitigation strategy produced . The financial 
contribution will be used fo r the management and enhancement  of an agreed suitable 
identified site for Solent Waders and Brent Geese.  
  
 Candidate Sites  
  
9.75 Candidate Sites contain some records of Solent Waders and Brent Geese. However, 
these numbers encountered have been recorded less frequently compared to other sites 
in the Solent Wader and Brent Goose network. There is the potential that these sites 
could be classified as Core, Primary Support, Secondary or Low Use Areas, but further 
surveys are necessary to determine the classification of these sites.  
  
9.76 To confirm the classification of a Candidate Site, the following amount of survey data as 
per the agreed methodology with the appropriate site management conditions will be 
required;  
• Two consecutive years survey where there has only been one survey to date . 
• One-year survey where there has been two or more surveys to date  
  
9.77 The level of survey information will depend on the amount of existing survey data 
available. It is expected that applicants consult with the appropriate bodies such as 
members of the Solent Wader and Brent Geese  Steering Group and the Council’s 
Ecologist a nd follow an appropriate survey methodology such as that set out in the 
Solent Wader and Brent Goose Strategy. Once the site classification has been 
confirmed, the requirements for development on Core, Primary Support, Secondary 
Support and Low Use Areas w ill need to be adhered to.   
253 
 
  
9.78 At present there are no Candidate Sites within Fareham, however this could change with 
subsequent updates to the Solent Wader and Brent Goose Strategy and if new 
records/survey data comes to light showing an area as havi ng potential for Solent 
Waders and Brent Geese.  
  
 Trees, Woodland and Hedgerows  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
9.79 Trees, woodlands  and hedgerows are under increasing threat from pollution, disease 
and the pressures of the developing world. As a result, over the last 100 years the tree 
canopy in our towns and cities has significantly declined.  
  
9.80 The loss of trees, woodlands and hedgerows in our built environment reduces liveability. 
Balancing our Borough’s growth, whilst protecting the environment, maintaining vibrant 
public spaces, creating  recreational opportunities  and fostering economic growth is an 
increasing and on -going challenge.   
  
9.81 Trees, woodlands and hedgerows contribute to the environment in many ways; they 
improve the quality of the air removing dust particles and h armful g as emissions such as 
carbo n dioxide. In urban areas they help to reduce the heat island effect, reduce soil 
erosion and flash flooding by slowing down and capturing fast flowing water. In addition, 
trees, woodlands and hedgerows help to improve biodiversity and provide landscape 
character whilst also adding a sense of place in our communities. These benefits all help 
to improve the health and wellbeing of people and in turn improve the quality of life for 
those who live and work in Fareham.  
  
9.82 The challenge will be to constantly increase awareness of the long -term benefits of trees, 
woodlands and hedgerows within the urban environment. As Fareham continues to 
urbanise, this need increases, as does our obligation to enhance the quality of life i n 
Fareha m by delivering high quality and well -maintained green infrastructure . 
   
9.83 The Council has a  Corporate Tree Strategy98 in line with section 197 of the Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990, which provides guidance to developers on the protectio n, 
enhance ment and creation of high quality and well -maintained green infrastructure within 
the Borough.  The Council is also working on an update to the current 2012 -2017 Strategy 
a draft of which should be available soon.  
  
 Policy NE6: Trees, Woodland and Hedgerows  
 
Development will be permitted which:  
 
a) Avoids the unnecessary loss of non -protected trees, hedgerow s and 
woodland, particularly those which have high amenity value ;, 
b) Where their loss is unavoidable, provides for their replacement  in a 
suitable location ; and  
c) Where practicable, provides for new and suitable trees , woodland and 
hedgerows.  
 
98 http://www.fareham.gov.uk/pdf/planning/treestrategy.pdf   
254 
 
 
The removal of protected trees, groups of trees  (including veteran trees) , 
woodland (including ancient woodland) or hedgerows will only be permitted in 
exceptional circumstances . Where protected trees , woodland and hedgerows  are 
subject to removal , a replacement of an appropriate number, species and size in 
an appropriate location will be required.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
9.84 All trees, woodlands and hedgerows within the Borough provide benefits in terms of 
habitats, biodiversity, climate change mitigation and adap tation as well as being 
important to the character and amenity value of the Borough’s urban and rural 
landscap es. There is a presumption that loss and damage to trees, woodland and 
hedgerows should be avoided. Therefore, where it can be demonstrated that t he loss or 
damage to non -protected trees, woodland and hedgerows is unavoidable, the Council 
will seek replace ment and/or compensation where appropriate.  
  
9.85 The loss of Veteran Trees, Ancient Woodland and other protected trees, woodland and 
hedgerows will only be permissible in exceptional circumstances and any proposed loss 
will be considered on a case by c ase basis. The applicant mu st demonstrate clear and 
robust reasoning for any proposed loss, setting out why any loss is unavoidable and 
justified. The loss of any protected trees, woodland and hedgerows  should be 
compensated for by the replacement of an ap propriate number, species and size and in 
an appropriate location. This should be done in consultation with the Council’s Tree 
Team.  
  
9.86 Where development proposals affect existing trees, woodlands and hedgerows, 
applicants shall be required to submit their development proposals with an ecological 
and/or arboricultur al survey.  
  
9.87 To prevent damage to tree roots and branches, developers will be required to provide 
tree protection prior to and during the site clearance, demolition and construction 
phases.  
  
9.88 Where appropriate, the Council will seek opportunities for the planting of new trees, 
woodlands and hedgerows in suitable locations. This can be included as part of a 
development’s proposal to achieve net gains for biodiversity or to enable the 
development  to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change such as through a 
reduction in the urban heat island effect. Any new planting should be suitable for the site 
conditions, use native species where appropriate and be informed by and contribute to 
local c haracter, and enhance or create new habitat linkages. The Ecological Network 
Map produced by the Hampshire Biodiversity Information Centre (HBIC) which covers 
the whole of Hampshire, highlights areas where additional planting could help improve 
habitat lin kages and biodiversity.   
  
9.89 Appropriate costed ongoing maintenance specifications and plans will be necessary to 
protect any newly planted and existing trees, woodlands and hedgerows; and ensure 
they establish successfully and thrive so their long -term benefits can be delivered.  
  
 
  
255 
 
 Impact of New and Replacement Moorings  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
9.90 Fareham’s coastline contains a variety of moorings due to its location on the Solent, one 
of the best sailing areas in the country.  The River Hamble and the upper parts of 
Fareham Lake are very popular locations for boats and as such, include many areas for 
moorings and pontoon berths.  Given this popularity, there may be future demand for 
additional moorings.  However, the proximity of th e international designated sites in the 
Solent means that any new moorings need to be carefully balanced with the sensitive 
nature of these designated important sites.  In addition, new moorings need to be 
sensitively designed and located to ensure that lan dscape character, heritage and 
navigation are also not adversely affected.  
 
 Policy NE7: New Moorings  
 
New moorings will be permitted provided that  they are located outside of the 
Mooring Restriction Areas (as shown on the Policies map) and they would not 
have an adverse effect  on the integrity of internationally designated sites.  
 
Within designated Mooring Restriction Areas, the replacement or reloc ation of 
existing moorings will be permitted where there are no alternative locations 
outside of these areas and provided that they neither : 
• Impede the movement of craft or otherwise compromise navigational safety 
on the river ; nor 
 
• Disrupt existing recreational users or areas where there is existing or 
proposed public access ; nor  
 
• Adversely affect the nature conservation, landscape or heritage value of the 
River Hamble . 
  
 How this policy works  
  
 Mooring Restriction Areas  
  
9.91 To protect the visual amenity in and around the River Hamble and Fareham Lake, the 
following Mooring Restriction Areas (MRAs) are designated:  
• Fareham Lake  
• South of Warsash Sailing Club Jetty  
• Between Warsash Ferry and Hamble Village  
• South of Crableck  
• South of Swanwick Public Hard; and  
• The Upper Hamble and Curbridge Creek.  
  
9.92 For clarification purposes, the term “mooring” includes all facilities for securing yachts 
and other vessels, including berths at marinas.   
  
9.93 The River Hamble Harbour Authority (Hampshire County Council) manages moorings in 
the River Hamble, and has produced a Strategic Plan, Strategic Vision and a Business  
256 
 
Plan99. Previously the Authority imposed a limit of 3,261 moorings on the a reas of the 
river within their area of control.  Because boat sizes have increased, the number of 
moorings is currently some 200 below that total. The Council's planning jurisdiction 
extends to the administrative boundary which runs down the centre of the river. Planning 
permission is required for the construction of jetties, pontoons and related boardwalks 
and the driving of piles. Planning permission is usually required for the laying down of 
ground tackle for swing moorings. The Council will consult the River Hamble Harbour 
Authority accordingly on proposals particularly those which could impact on safety or 
navigation within the River.  
  
9.94 For Portsmouth Harbour, the Queens Harbour Master (QHM) Portsmouth is the 
regulatory authority and as such any development proposals like, replacement and/or 
demolition of moorings within Portsmouth Harbour should consult the QHM Portsmouth.  
  
9.95 Proposals for new moorings should also have regard and conform to the relevant policies 
within the Marine Management Organisation’s (MMO) South Marine Plan100. The Council 
shall consult the MMO on all applications where there is likely to be an impact on the 
marine area.  
  
9.96 New moorings, as well as the replacement and relocation of moorings in MRAs are also 
guided by the policy relating to likely significant effects on designated sites, as 
development of the site has the potential to result in likely significant effects on 
internationally designated sites such as the Portsmouth Harbour SPA and Ramsar, 
Solent and Southampton Water SPA and Ramsar, Solent and Dorset Coast SPA and 
Solent Maritime SAC . This can occur during the construction and/or operational and/or 
decommissioning  phase of a development proposal.  Where impacts on designated sites 
are likely to occur, ecological mitigation to address these impacts will need to be 
identified in detail at the planning application stage and accompanied where necessary 
by an assessment  in accordance with the relevant nature, wildlife and habitats 
legislation. The policy would also apply to any pSPAs or pSACs that may in future be 
designated in the area.  
  
9.97 Development proposals which implement measures that result in improvements to 
navigation and the appearance of either the River Hamble or Fareham Lake by relocating 
piled and buoyed moorings from within the MRAs to more appropriate locations are 
encouraged.  
  
 Air Quality  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
9.98 It is recognised that air quality is a major environmental factor that can affect human 
health, as well as significantly influence and alter local ecosystems. There are set limit 
values for air pollutants which are contained within Schedule 2 of the Air Qu ality 
Standards Regulations 2010101. Paragraph 181 in the NPPF seeks to ensure that 
planning decisions sustain and contribute towards compliance with relevant limit values 
or national objectives for those pollutants.  The Council has taken steps to improve A ir 
Quality in the Borough since the original identification of two Air Quality Management

Areas (AQMAs) and corresponding Air Quality Action Plan102. Both AQMAs we re 
extended in November 2017 following on from the results of the Annual Status and 
Detailed Assessment of Air Quality Report103. Whilst the Air Quality Action Plan s focus  
primarily on the A27 and the A32, the Council monitors over 40 locations throughout the 
Borough.

9.99 In July 2017, the Government published its UK plan for tackling roadside nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2) concentrations104. It identified Fareham Borough Council as being one of the local 
authorities where the annual mean European Limit Value for NO2 (40 µg/m³) is at risk of 
being exceeded in  the near  future.  In order to ensure no areas exceed the NO2 
thresholds in the future, it i s essential for the Council to identify measures to reduce the 
NO2 emissions across the Borough and make improvements to local air quality105 . The 
UK plan for tackling roadside nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations  stated that as well 
as Air Quality Action  Plans, Local Plans should seek to target air pollution measures so 
as to minimise the impact on local residents and businesses . The Local Plan therefore 
aims to ensure that future development does not contribute to or make worse the levels 
of air quality within Fareham.  
  
9.100  In November 2019, the National Planning Policy Guidance was updated to reflect the 
requirement that Local Plans should seek opportunities to actively improve air quality

through plan -making and development management decisions. Following these 
changes and in light of recent discussion on air quality with neighbouring authorities 
through PfSH, it is now considered appropriate to include a policy specifically on air 
quality within the Local Plan.  
  
9.101  Twenty four per cent  of all emissions across the UK c an be directly attributed to 
Transport106. Road transport is the most significant source of emissions in this sector, in 
particular passenger cars. The Council recognises that most development in Fareham 
could increase road transport emissions, both during the construction and operational 
phases.  However, it is also recognised that the Local Plan can positively influence air 
quality through the promotion of sustainable development. The approach to this Air 
Quality Policy will be to  ensure that areas of the Borough remain within safe legal limits 
of pollutants  by minimising  road transport emissions wherever practicable to sustainable 
levels, while also seeking to counter the cumulative impacts arising from the aggregation 
of incremental emissions arising from each development scheme.  Developments  will 
therefore be required where possible to provide infrastructure supporting the use of 
alternative vehicle types and fuels in support of both Government and Council ambitions 
in improving Air Quality.    
  
9.102  In formulating the Local Plan it is necessary to consider:  
 
• The observed trends in recent air quality monitoring data and what would happen 
to these trends in light of the proposed allocations ; 
• Any impacts from point sources of air pollution;  
• The potential cumulative impact of a number of smaller developments on air 
quality as well as the effect of more substantial developments, including their 
implications for vehicle emissions ; 
• Ways in which new development could be made appropriate in locati ons where 
air quality is or is likely to be a concern, and not give rise to unacceptable risks 
from pollution ; and,  
• Opportunities to improve air quality or mitigate impacts, such as through traffic 
and travel management and green infrastructure provision a nd enhancement.  
  
9.103  The Sustainability Appraisal  (SA) of the Local Plan is the basis for including these 
considerations and has informed the  selection of development allocations which  make 
up the Development Strategy for the Local Plan. Using the S A process has ensured a 
strategic approach to air quality has been undertaken to ensure as far as possible that 
the selected development allocations are located in areas where air quality is  not likely 
to be a concern now or in the future.  The approach will  also enable the Council to help 
secure net improvements in overall air quality where possible through measures such 
as traffic and travel management and green infrastructure provision and  enhancement 
in areas at risk of being above air quality limits.  
  
9.104  Local air quality improvements can be achieved through good practices, careful design 
of neighbourhoods and actions such as ensuring public services are joined up, and 
easier to access via public transport, active travel modes or other sustainable transport 
choices. Improvements can also be accomplished through highway improvement 
measures, such as modifications to junctions to improve flows, achieved through 
physical works or developer contributions to future highway improvement schemes.

259 
 
9.105  Additionally, the provision or enhancement of Green Infrastructure (GI)  (in line with Policy 
NE9)  should be considered in conjunction with any mitigation measures aimed at 
reducing vehicle emissions. Certain forms of GI such as trees can create a barrier o r 
maintain separation between sources of pollution and receptors.   
  
 Policy  NE8: Air Quality  
 
Major development shall minimise emissions and contribute to the improvement 
of local air quality and the delivery of Green Infrastructure. Minor  development 
should  reduce its impacts on air quality.  
 
Development which may be affected by poor local air quality will be permitted 
where no unacceptable harm is likely to be caused to its occupants or visitors . 
 
Excluding the land within the Welborne Plan, d evelopment will be permitted 
where it:  
 
a) Provides for the charging of plug -in and other ultra -low emission vehicles 
in safe, accessible and convenient locations  as follows : 
• One EV charging point installation per residential dwelling with off -
street parking; and , 
• At least one EV fast‘rapid  charge ’ point in shared parking areas per 10 
residential dwellings or 1,000m2 of commercial or leisure floorspace; 
and  
b) Demonstrates good p ractice and principles of design, minimising 
emissions and contributing to the reduction of transport impacts on local 
air quality ; and   
 
c) Where relevant, p ositively contributes to the delivery of the Council’s Air 
Quality Action Plan by mitigating any ide ntified effects of development on 
air quality within Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) and/or any Clean 
Air Zones;  
  
 How this policy works 
  
9.106  It is important that applicants engage  early on with the Council, including Environmental 
Health, to establish the need and scope of any assessment to support an application.  
All major developments  as defined by the NPPF (see glossary) will be expected to 
produce an Air Quality Assessment and should include the consideration of increased 
exposure for relevant receptors affected by the development. This is in recognition that 
the Borough was identified as being one  of the local authorities where the annual mean 
European Limit Value for NO2 (40 µg/m³) is at risk of being exceeded in future years . 
  
9.107  Consideration should be given to the potential impacts of neighbouring pollutant sources 
on the site and whether the development will expose future occupiers to unacceptable 
levels of air pollution, even if an assessment of impacts of the development on th e 
surrounding area is screened out. The assessment should also demonstrate that the 
development will minimise emissions and contribute to the reduction of impacts on local 
air quality  and state how this could be achieved through for example, design and 
provision of Green Infrastructure.  
   
260 
 
9.108  Minor developments  which  includes those schemes that are not covered by the definition 
of major development as explained in the NPPF are not required to produce an Air 
Quality Assessment  (AQA)  except where the development is likely to expose future 
occupiers to unacceptable levels of NO2 and/ or particula te matter; for example, by being 
in close proximity to an existing source of poor air quality (M27 motorway or major A 
road) or located within  or close to an Air Quality Management Area or area  that has  
existing poor  levels of air quality .  
  
9.109  There is a recognition that minor developments may not in themselves create an 
additional air quality problem  but will cumulatively add to local air pollution and potentially 
introduce more people likely to be exposed to existing levels of poor air quality. 
Therefore , minor developments will be expected  to reduce their air quality impacts  and 
mitigation may still be required to offset air qua lity concerns in the area. This can be 
achieved through encouraging modes of active travel and / or the provision and 
enhancement of Green Infrastructure.  
  
9.110  For minor developments, an assessment of the likelihood of needing an AQA will be 
determine d using the following criteria:  
• The proposal is adjacent to or within an AQMA; or  
• The proposal is sited less than 20m from roads at or above the relevant national 
objective s highlighted on the DEFRA GIS modelled maps107   
• The proposal is one of the following Land Use types and within 20m of roads with 
>10,000 annual average daily transport  movements:  
• Hotels, Residential Institutions (including secure) and Dwelling 
Houses ;  
• (Homes of Multiple Occupation  (including those with more than 
six residents ; or 
•  Non-residential Institutions  
  
9.111  The provision or enhancement of Green Infrastructure (GI) should be considered in 
conjunction with any mitigation measures aimed at reducing vehicle emissions. Certain 
forms of GI such as trees can create a barrier or maintain separation between sources 
of pollution and receptors.  
  
9.112  Other mitigation options to improve local air quality can be achieved through good 
practices, careful design of neighbourhoods and actions such as ensuring public 
services are joined up, and enabling easier to access via  public transport, active travel 
modes or other sustainable transport choices. Improvements can also be accomplished 
through highway improvement measures, such as modifications to junctions to improve 
flows, achieved through physical works or developer con tributions to future highway 
improvement schemes.  
  
9.113  Mitigation options will need to be related to the development in terms of nature and 
proportion to the likely impact. The Council will work with applicants to consider 
appropriate mitigation to en sure new development is appropriate for its location and 
unacceptable risks are prevented. Planning conditions  and obligations  may be used to 
secure mitigation where the relevant tests are met.   
  
9.114  Environmental Health  department with of the Council will be consulted  with regards to 
air quality impacts on or resulting from all development where:  
 
107 http://uk -air.defra.gov.uk/data/gis -mapping    
261 
 
• The development is in close proximity to an existing source of poor air quality 
(M27 motorway or major A road) or located within or close to an Air Quality 
Management Area; or  
• When  the development is likely to create emissions by for example,  substantially 
increasing traffic movement, or is an industrial process, 10 or more dwellings or 
a site of 0.5  ha or more, or 1,000 sqm or more of commercial, leisure or industrial 
use. 
  
9.115  Planning applications will need to consider the effects of development and its inherent 
increased demand on the road networks leading to increasing detrimental effects on air 
quality. Whether air quality is relevant to a planning decision will depend on the proposed 
development and its location. Conside rations that may be relevant to determining a 
planning application include whether the development would :                                                                    
• Lead to changes (including any potential reductions) in vehicle -related emissions 
in the immediate vicinity of the proposed development or further afield:  
• Introduce new point sources of air pollution.  
• Expose people to harmful concentrations of air pollutants, including dust. This 
could be by building new homes, schools, workplaces or ot her development in 
places with poor air quality;  
• Give rise to potentially unacceptable impacts (such as dust) during construction 
for nearby sensitive locations;  
• Have a potential adverse effect on biodiversity, especially where it would affect 
sites designated for their biodiversity value.  
  
9.116  The Council may prepare and adopt further detailed guidance in the form of a 
Supplementary Planning Document to assist the determination of p lanning applications 
in accordance with this policy . 
  
9.117  Developments shall consider and employ the principles of good design stated in the 
Institute of Air Quality Management (IAQM) Land -use Planning & Development Contro l: 
Planning for Air Quality:  
 
• New development should not contravene the Council’s Air Quality Action Plan, 
or render any of the measures unworkable;  
• New development should not create a new street canyon, or a building 
configuration that inhibits effective pollution dispersion;  
• New development m inimise public exposure to pollution sources e.g. by 
locating habitable rooms away from busy roads or directin g combustion 
generated pollutants through well sited vents or chimney stacks.   
• The provision of at least 1 Electric Vehicle (EV) “rapid charge” point per 10 
residential dwellings and/or 1000m2 of commercial floorspace. Where on -site 
parking is provided for  residential dwellings, EV charging points for each 
parking space should be provided (this also accords with the aspiration of 
Government as set out in the publication Road to Zero  Next Steps108 towards 
cleaner road transport and delivering our Industrial Strategy)

zero.pdf   
262 
 
• Where development generates significant additional traffic, provision of a 
detailed travel plan (with provision to measure its implementation and effect) 
which sets out measures to enc ourage  sustainable means of transport.  
• All gas -fired C ombined Heat and Power  plant s must  meet a minimum 
emissions standard of:  
• Spark ignition engine: 250 mg NOx/Nm3;  
• Compression ignition engine: 400 mg NOx/Nm3;  
• Gas turbine: 50 mg NOx/Nm3109. 
• A presumption s hould be to use natural gas -fired installations. Where biomass 
is proposed within an urban area it is to meet minimum emissions standards 
of:  
• Solid biomass boiler: 275 mgNOx/Nm3 and 25 mgPM/Nm3.  
  
9.117.1  In respect of EV charging facilities for new development, the IAQM Guidance states:  
 
• The provision of at least 1 Electric Vehicle (EV) “ fast charge” point per 10 
residential dwellings and/or 1000m2 of commercial floorspace. Where on -site 
parking is provided for residential dwellings, EV charging poin ts for each 
parking space should be provided .  
 
The use of the word “fast” within Policy NE8 refers to installing a charging facility that 
takes the least amount of time to charge vehicles whilst still being financially viable to 
vehicle users. This is rec ognition that in a shared parking environment, it is often 
necessary to charge vehicles as quick as  possible in order to adequately service the 
expected number of users within that shared space. Policy NE8 also proposes that at a 
minimum, one EV charging f acility is required per residential dwelling with off -street 
parking . This is  slightly different  from the IAQM Guid ance and is  in recognition that EV 
facilities will often be built into the fabric of the new development and often it is only 
possible to get one vehicle at a time close enough to the building to charge it. The 
approach of Policy NE8 in  requiring EV charging facilities within new development 
accords with the asp iration of Government as set out in the publication Road to Zero  
Next Steps110 towards cleaner road transport and delivering our Industrial Strategy . 
  
9.118  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Whilst Policy NE8: Air Quality focuses on the human aspect of negative changes in air 
quality, i t is recognised that poor levels of air quality can also lead to environmental 
issue s; causing  likely significant effects on the internationally designated sites in the 
Solent and South Hampshire  region . Policy NE1 of this Local Pl an ensures that 
development will only be permitted where internationally designated sites are protected 
and enhanced. This means that development that results in negative changes to air 
quality may not be permissible under Policy NE1 because of the signifi cant effects it may 
have on the internationally designated sites. In addition to Policy NE1 and a s part of the 
local plan process, the Council has produce d a Habitats Regulations Assessment  (HRA) 
which determines whether the P lan, its Policies and Developm ent Allocations will have 
any significant effects on internationally important habitats and species in the immediate

 and wider geographical area. The HRA111 for the plan assessed the Local Plan's impact 
on air quality and concluded that it will not result i n adverse effect s on the  integrity  of 
designated sites would not have a likely significant effect on the internationally important 
habitats and species  present in the area.  
  
 Green Infrastructure  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
9.119  Green Infrastructure (GI) is a network of multi -functional green spaces, green links, 
Rights of Way network and other green areas which link urban areas to the wider 
countryside. It has multiple environmental and socio -economic benefits such as: 
providing mitigation and adaptation to climate change and pollution control, promoting 
healthy, active lifestyles and associated natural capital. GI can also have a positive role 
in enhancing and protecting heritage assets and historic landscape character within the  
Borough whilst also facilitating better access and enjoyment.  
  
9.120  The Council is working with the Partnership for South Hampshire (PfSH ) to support and 
deliver the sub -regional strategic green infrastructure network set out in the PfSH Green 
Infrastructure Strategy 2017 and Implementation Plan 2018. The strategy promotes a 
variety of strategic projects such as the Forest of Bere, watercou rse and river corridor 
restoration and enhancement as well as projects which will help direct recreation 
pressure away from sensitive European sites.  
  
9.121  In addition, the Green Infrastructure Strategy for Fareham Borough 2014 and the list of 
GI proje cts detailed in the IDP sets out the local projects within the GI network helping 
to connect the local network to those links being created at Welborne, neighbouring 
districts and the sub -regional level. The Fareham strategy identifies several projects 
which can help support and maintain ecological networks, and promotes sustainable 
modes of transport through increased pedestrian and cycling opportunities across the 
Borough created by the formulation of new public rights of way links. The Council is 
committ ed to improving the Green Infrastructure network for Fareham and will continue 
to work in partnership with the local community, PfSH, developers, landowners, 
Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust and other organisations to protect, provide 
and enhance  the Borough and Sub -regional’s Green Infrastructure network.  
  
 Policy NE 9: Green Infrastructure  
 
Where appropriate, development shall  provide Green Infrastructure (GI) which is 
fully integrated into development and maximises opportunities to connect to the 
wider GI Network.  
 
Development proposals that reduce the quality  of the existing GI network will only 
be permitted where suitable m itigation is identified and secured.  
 
Development that directly impact s upon, or is adjacent to  proposed  GI projects 
that are included within the PfSH Green Infrastructure Strategy/Implementation 
Plan or Fareham Borough Infrastructure Delivery Plan should  not prevent its 
 
111 Available at : www.fareham.gov.uk/planning/publicationplanevidence.aspx    
264 
 
future delivery and  provide a physical connection to the proposed GI Project.  
Exceptions will only be permitted where :  
• Suitable alternative GI provision of equivalent benefit is provided  as part of 
the development; or  
• A financial contribution is secured for suitable alternative GI provision by 
the relevant authority.  
  
 How this policy works 
  
9.122  Development proposals which could adversely impact upon existing Green Infrastructure 
(GI) assets will only be granted permission where suitable mitigation is satisfactorily 
agreed and secured. This is to ensure that the local GI network is continually 
safeguarded and does not become fragmented. There are many features and 
components of the GI network that are also associated with the Local Ecological 
Network. Proposals that relate to Policy NE9 should also ensure they comply with Policy 
NE1 Protection of B iodiversity, Nature Conservation and the Local Ecological Network.  
  
9.123    Development proposals which are located close to or on future identified GI projects 
within the PfSH Green Infrastructure Implementation Plan112 or listed within the Council's 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) should ensure they do not impact on these futu re 
projects. This is by means of preventing their future delivery, blocking/fragmenting or 
destroying the GI network. Exceptions will be made where alternative provision which is 
the same or better quality is secured or a financial contribution for the cre ation of an 
alternative GI project nearby is obtained by the relevant authority. The relevant authority 
in this case would be Fareham Borough Council or Hampshire County Council.  
  
9.124    Some examples of the network of multi -functional green infrastruc ture can include:   
• Public Rights of Way  
• Cemeteries and churchyards  
• Parks and gardens  
• Amenity open space in residential developments including incidental areas of 
green space such as grass verges  
• Allotments and community gardens  
• River and wildlife/ green corridors  
• Local nature reserves  
• Accessible countryside and woodland  
  
9.125    The Council will continue to use appropriate funding mechanisms to invest in appropriate 
management, enhancement a nd restoration, of the existing network. Ensuring links and 
buffers to established sites are maintained and new areas of Green Infrastructure are 
created. The Council will support development proposals which provide Green 
Infrastructure on site and which m aximise opportunities for connections to the wider GI 
network.  
  
 Protection and Provision of Open Space  
  
 Why this policy is needed

June -2019 -.pdf  
265 
 
9.126    Access to high quality open spaces and opportunities for sport and recreation can make 
an important contribution to the health and well -being of communities. These spaces are 
also valuable areas for wildlife and biodiversity and make a valuable contributio n to the 
Borough’s adaptation and resilience to climate change. The NPPF provides protection 
for open space, sports and recreational buildings and land, including playing fields, which 
should not be developed unless very specific circumstances arise (parag raph 97). It is in 
the interest of the Borough’s residents to retain existing areas of open space whilst 
providing new areas as part of new development and addressing identified deficiencies 
to ensure the Borough retains a high -quality environment in which  to live in.  
  
 Policy NE 10: Protection and Provision of Open Space  
 
Development  on open space will be permitted provided:  
• The open space , or the relevant part, is clearly shown to be  surplus to local 
requirements and will not be needed in the long -term; or  
• The loss of open space is to be replaced by at least equivalent or better in 
terms of quantity, quality and accessibility and there will be no overall 
negative impact on the provis ion of open space; or  
• The development is for alternative sports and recreational provision, which 
meets locally identified needs and clearly outweighs the loss of the current 
or former use.   
 
Residential development will be required to provide open and play space to meet 
the needs of new residents. Where possible, development shall address any 
additional identified deficiencies in open space highlighted within the most 
recent Open Space study.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
9.127    Any proposals for development on  all or part of  open space should be accompanied by 
a detailed assessment of that open space. The quantity, type and primary purpose of the 
open space in question will determine the  extent and type of  assessment required. For 
example, open space which is primarily parks and amenity open space would perhaps 
have an assessment that had greater emphasis on the recreational value of the open 
space , whilst natural greenspace would have more detail on the ecological values. If the 
open space is multi -functional in terms of acting as a buffer/ aesthetic value as well as 
being of ecological value, then an assessment would be expected to clearly demonstrate  
that the loss of that open space would not be detriment al to any of the functions and 
purposes of that open space.  
  
9.128    In addition to allocated open space and Public Rights of Way, the Council will seek to 
protect any open space which has pub lic value, including those not shown on the 
adopted Policies m ap. Non -designated open space can have additional value which c an 
include visual, usable, recreation and biodiversity benefits.  
  
9.129    In the circumstance where the Education Authority has received approval for the disposal 
of surplus school playing fields from the Secretary of State, in accordance with Section 
77 of the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998, an exception may be made to 
this policy where equivalent or greater community benefits are provided . 
   
266 
 
9.130   There is a wide range of multi -functional recreational, amenity and natural greenspaces 
within the Borough. These open spaces can be defined as space which acts as a focus 
for the community, contributes to community cohesion and development, landscape 
cons ervation, biodiversity conservation, visual amenity and tranquillity, environmental 
sustainability and climate change resilience, active and passive recreation, and the local 
economy. Examples of multi -functional green space provision can include:  
 
• Parks and gardens  
• Recreational grounds  
• Playing fields  
• Amenity open space in residential developments, including incidental green space  
• Allotments and community gardens  
• Cemeteries and churchyards  
• Open spaces of historic significance  
• Woodland  
• Natural grasslands and wetlands  
• Informal provision for children and young people  
• Public Rights of Way  
• River and green corridors  
  
9.131  The NPPF requires local planning authorities to ensure that sufficient open space is 
provided to meet the needs of communities. The Open Space Study (2018)113 describes 
the quantity, quality and accessibility of open spaces within the Borough. It utilised 
evidence studies gathered in support of previous Local Plans, and available best practice 
guidance to derive a serie s of quantity, quality and accessibility standards for assessing 
current open space provision in Fareham. The results showed that overall, the Borough 
has a relatively good provision of Natural Greenspace , Parks and Amenity Open Space 
and Young People Prov ision (includes children’s play equipment and youth provision). 
However, there is a noticeable shortage of  some of these types of open spaces  in a few 
wards against the standards. The Open Space Study provides further details on  this. 
   
9.132  It is expe cted that development proposals which need to provide open space should 
have regard to the most recent Open Space Study to address  any specific open space 
deficits of a particular area.  
  
9.133  Where the provision of onsite open space has been clearly shown not to be possible, the 
Council will also seek to enhance and improve the quality of existing open spaces within 
the Borough particularly where there are quality deficiencies identified. To do this, the 
following approaches will be pursued:  
• Improve the accessibility to and within existing open spaces  
• Improve the overall quality of existing open spaces in terms of planting, furniture, 
outdo or gym and provision for children and young people etc.  
• Delivering open space projects included within the Fareham and P fSH Green 
Infrastructure Strategies  
• Support and work with par tnering organisations such as Pf SH to provide 
additional strategic open sp ace such as S uitable Alternative Natural 
Greenspace s (SANGs) . 
  
9.134  It is proposed that the standards for open space provision contained within the  Planning 
Obligations Supplementary Planning Document should continue to be used as a 
 
113 Accessible at: www.fareham.gov .uk/planning/publicationplanevidence.aspx    
267 
 
minimum guide for new parks and amenity open space and play provision114. In addition, 
where accessible natural greenspace may need to be provided as part of new 
developmen t but separate to any parks and amenity open space, it is considered that 
using 2ha of natural greenspace per 1,000 population is appropriate. This particular 
standard is based on the work of previous open space studies and the recommendation 
of Natural En gland (at the time known as English Nature) minimum ANGST standard of 
all people having 2ha of natural greenspace within 300m walk115. It is recognised that 
development may be required to provide more open space above what is required by 
the standards to ma ke the development more acceptable. This is why the proposed open 
space standards should be considered as a minimum requirement for development 
which they apply.  
 
  
Parks and Amenity Open Space   
 1.5 ha per 1,000 Population.  
 
Natural Greenspace  2 ha per 1,000 Population  
Children’s Play Equipment  14 pieces of equipment per 1,000 1 -12 
year olds   
 
 Table 9.1. Minimum Open Space standards suggested for new development  
  
9.135 Proposals for offsite contributions of open space in lieu of onsite provision is only 
considered appropriate where there is sufficient viability and land constraints and it can 
be clearly demonstrated that the needs of new residents can be met by existing open 
space, which is close by, and without adversely impacting on th e needs of existing 
residents in the area.  
  
9.136 Open space has fundamental links to green infrastructure whereby provision together 
can help to improve the interconnectivity of the wider green grid within and beyond the 
Borough. The delivery of open s pace can help to support the delivery of green 
infrastructure and vice versa. As such, open space requirements should be considered 
alongside green infrastructure.  
  
 Local Green Space  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
9.137 Local Green Spaces are designated green areas which are demonstrably special to the 
local community. The designation affords a level of protection against development 
except in exceptional circumstances. Local Green Spaces can be anything from sports 
pavilions and allotments to urban spaces that provide a tranquil oasis. In most cases, a 
Local Green Space designation is not required because adequate protection from 
development can be provided from existing designations and policies. Paragraph 100 of 
the Nat ional Planning Policy Framework provides the circumstances where Local Green 
Space designations are appropriate, such as:  
• Where the greenspace is in a reasonably close proximity to the community it 
serves;  
• Where the area is demonstrably special to the community and holds a particular 
local significance for, beauty, historic significance, recreational value, tranquillity or 
richness of its wildlife; and  
 
114 Please note there is a specific Planning Obligations SPD for Welborne.   
115 http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/65021    
268 
 
• Where the green area concerned is local in character and is not an extensive 
tract of land.  
  
9.138 There were previously  no designated Local Green Spaces within the Borough. However, 
as a result of the Issues and O ptions c onsultation carried out by the C ouncil in 2019, a 
number of areas of the Borough were submitted for consideration for Local Green Space 
designation. These were assessed within the Local Greenspace Background Paper116 
using the criteria within the NPPF. As a result of this  three  have been designated.  
 
• Mullberry Avenue Open Space  
• Dore Avenue Open Space  
• Oxley's Coppice  
  
   Policy NE11: Local Green Space  
 
Proposals that protect or enhance Local Green Space  designations  as shown on 
the Policies m ap or designated through future Neighbourhood Plans, will be 
permitted.  
 
Appropriate forms of development that would be permitted within Local Green 
Spaces are :   
• The construction of new buildings or facilities (in connection with the 
existing use of land) for: outdoor sport or recreation; allotments; cemeteries 
and burial grounds or community uses;  
  
• The extension or alteration of an existing building provided it does not 
result in disproportionate additions relative to  the original building;  
 
• The re -use or replacement of existing buildings, provided that a new use 
does not conflict with the reason for  designation of the Local Green Space 
and any replacement building is not materially larger than the existing 
building; and  
 
• The carrying out of engineering or other operations required for public 
safety or to provide essential infrastructure.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
9.139 Paragraph 101 in the NPPF states that policies for managing development within a Local 
Green Space should be consistent with those for Green Belts. Paragraphs 145 -146 of 
the NPPF  highlight the forms of development that are considered appropriate for Green 
Belt land. Policy NE11 details which forms of development listed are considered 
appropriate Local Green Spac e.  
  
9.140 It is not considered appropriate for example, to allow limited infilling in villages or 
buildings for agriculture and forestry on Local Green Spac e. However, it  may be  
considered appropriate to allow the construction of new buildings or facilities in 
connection with the existing use of land providing the  construction of new or replacement 
 
116 Available here: www.fareham.gov.uk/plan ning/publicationplanevidence.aspx    
269 
 
buildings does not conflict with the primary reasons why the Local Green Space was 
designated , for example,  for its beauty and wildlife values.  
   
 
 
 
270 
    
 Sustainable Transport  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
10.1 A convenient, efficient, resilient  and safe transport network within the Borough is vital in 
supporting residents, businesses and visitors to the Borough, and to the wider economy 
of the Solent area.  
  
10.2 Paragraph 102 of the  NPPF  places a requirement on plan making authorities to ensure 
the identification of transport issues are considered from the earliest stages of plan -
making. Plans should ensure that the potential impacts of development on transport 
networks are addressed, opportunities from existing or proposed transport infrastructure 
and changing technology are realised, opportunities to promote travel by alternative 
modes are identified and pursued, an d that the environmental impacts of traffic and 
transport infrastructure are identified, assessed and taken into account. The planning 
system should actively manage patterns of growth in support of these objectives.  
  
10.3 The Hampshire Local Transport Plan 2011 to 2031116 (LTP) sets out the vision and 
priorities of the Highway Authority (Hampshire County Council). Fareham Borough 
Council works  in partnership with the Highway Authority and other stakeholders117 to 
reduce the need to travel and promote a transport system  that seeks to improve journey 
time reliability, accessibility to services and key destinations and manage congestion. To 
facilitate this the Local Plan will require development to accord with the following 
principles outlined in th e LTP:  
• Maximise the potential of the Borough’s key location between the cities of 
Portsmouth and Southampton, through facilitating integration and improvement 
to the strategic road and rail network to the wider region;  
• Promot e transport choice through the  delivery of high -quality improvements to 
public transport services and supporting infrastructure, including Rapid Transit 
options ; 
• Ensuring convenient cycling and walking networks which contribute towards a 
modal shift away from less sustainable modes of travel, providing genuine 
alternative options to the motor car;  
• Securing accessibility improvements to town, district and local centres and 
transport hubs by all modes of transport, ensuring good integration and 
interchanges between transport modes; and, 
• Facilitate management of network congestion which contributes to achieving 
consisten t journey times throughout the B orough.  
  
10.4 
 
 
 The Highway Authority’s preferred approach to mitigation of highway impacts, is to focus 
on active and sustainable modes of travel and reducing the need to travel by motor 
vehicle. Motor vehicle traffic capacity enhancements at junctions should be considered 
the “worst -case” mitigation scenario and should not be considered by developers as the 
default solution to be co nsidered through their respective planning applications. Only

 Strategic  Policy  TIN1: Sustainable Transport  
 
New development should reduce the need to travel by motorised vehicle through 
the promotion of sustainable and active travel modes, offering a genuine choice 
of mode  of travel .  
 
Development will be permitted where it:  
 
a) Contributes to the delivery of identified cycle , and pedes trian  and other 
non-road user  routes and connects with  existing  and future public  
transport networks  (including Rapid Transit), giving priority to cycling and 
pedestrian non-motorised user  movement ; and  
 
b) Facilitates access to public transport services, through the provision of 
connections to the existing infrastructure, or provision of new 
infrastructure through physical works or funding contributions; and 
 
c) Provides an internal layout which is compatible f or all users , including 
those with disabilities and reduced mobility , with acceptable  parking  and 
servicing provision, ensuring access to the development and highway 
network is safe, attractive in character, functional and accessible  
  
 How this policy works  
  
10.5 Applications should be supported by a Travel Plan118 that will identify measures to 
facilitate and encourage the use of sustainable and active travel modes, thereby reducing 
the need to travel by motor vehicle. The Highway Authority Local Cycling and Walking 
Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP) identifies a network of key walking  and cycling routes across 
the B orough and recommends actions along those routes where improvements are 
needed. Applications will be required to contribute to the delivery of the LCWIP to raise 
the profiles of cycling and walking as viable al ternatives to driving, contributing to the  
objective of reducing the level of car usage in Fareham.  
  
10.6 Sustainable transport and active travel modes are an essential consideration when 
developing a site and determine how the site will function in ter ms of travel patterns. To 
encourage the uptake and continued use of sustainable modes of transport, the location, 
design and layout of development will need to show significant prominence and priority 
being given to pedestrian and cycle movements and then to sustainable transport 
initiatives , maximising the catchment area  and integration with bus or other public 
transport  networks .   
  
10.7 Developments should be  designed with accessibility, permeability  and integration with 
existing networks  in mind, con sidering  all users,  ensuring provision of, or access to, local 
services and facilities.  Where applicable, LCWIP routes are identified within site 
allocation policies to enable measures  to ensure new developments generate as little 
 
 
118 https://www.hants.gov.uk/transport/deve lopers/travelplans   
 
 
272 
    
additional vehicular mov ement on the existing road networks as possible are considered 
from the outset.   
  
10.8 For a site to be considered sustainable outside of existing settlement urban area  
boundaries in respect of accessibility , it will need to be demonstrated that the intended 
use and occupiers ha ve a reasonable prospect of a choice of modes of transport to key 
destinations. Where it is proposed to improve the transport credentials of a site by means 
of contributions to the transport in frastructure serving it, it would need to be demonstrated 
that the suggested measures were feas ible, viable and sustainable.  
  
10.9 It is essential that new developments provide safe and suitable  internal layouts and 
access to the highway network and pro vide an internal layout that minimises the 
likelihood of conflict between road users, whether vehicular, pedestrian or cyclist.   Where 
new accesses or additional use of existing unsatisfactory access( es) or minor roads are 
required, t he Highway Authority will need to be satisfied that it is safe and that the 
appropriate visibility for all highway users can be provided . 
  
10.10  Where appropriate,  relevant and in accordance with other policies in this Plan, the 
Council will seek, by means of legal agreements, implementation through section 278 
agreements, or financial contributions through section 106 towards improvements to 
local transport network s and cycling and walking routes. Contributions may take the form 
of improvements to infrastructure such as road junctions, cycle and walking routes, 
enhancement to existing bridleways and footpaths, or the provision of additional or 
improved public transp ort services such as Bus Rapid Transit or Rail.  
  
10.11  All development should af ford appropriate parking provision, and cycle storage facilities 
in terms of amount, design  and layout, in accordance with the adopted Fareham 
Residential Car and Cycle Parking Sta ndards Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) 
and Non-Residential Parking Standards SPD.  
  
 Highway Safety  and Road Network  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
10.12  Fareham Borough Council (L ocal Planning Authority) and Hampshire County Council 
(Highway Authority) jointly have a responsibility to consider the impact of development 
proposed through the Local Plan on the highway network. As Highway Authority, the 
County Council is responsible for the upkeep, improvements and expansion of the 
highway network within Hampshire borders. The primary focus of the highway authority 
within Fareham is to:  
• Maintain the function of the M27 and A27 for strategic connectivity;   
• Maintain and where appropriate improve the safety and capacity of the networks 
linking local communities to the A27 and beyond;  
• Further develop the concept and provision of public transport includin g Bus Rapid 
Transit within the B orough and with links to  adjoining areas; and,  
• Promote access to local services and facilities by sustainable transport modes 
(public transport, walking and cycling).  
  
10.13  The Local Plan has  a responsibility to consider the impact of development on the highway 
network. Paragraph 109 of the NPPF states that new development should not undermine  
 
 
273 
    
highway safety or have a severe adverse effect on the highway network. New 
development should conside r alternative  mitigation options  which would follow a 
sequential approach to assess their impact on the local road  network and the role they 
can play in traffic reduction and reducing transport emissions  starting with measures to 
avoid the need to travel, active travel measures, public  transport and finally localised 
junction improvements.  
  
10.14  The Local Plan is supported by a Strategic Transport Assessment ( STA). The TA model s 
the transport impacts of the development proposed through the Local Plan, test 
measures to mitigate severe negative impacts, and consider whether the level of 
proposed development is appropriate.  The TA is based on a sub -regional model 
assessing the impac t of the Local Plan development in combination. It is imperative that 
all proposals are supported by suitable evidence to show that any significant impacts 
from the development on the transport network, or on highway safety, can be cost 
effectively mitigat ed to an acceptable degree.  
  
 Policy TIN2: Highway Safety  and Road Network   
  
Development will be permitted where:   
 
a) There is no unacceptable impact on highway safety, and the residual 
cumulative impact  on the road  networks  is not severe ; and 
 
b) The impac ts on the local and strategic highway network  arising from the 
development itself or the cumulative effects of development on the 
network  are mitigated  through a sequential approach consisting of 
measures that would avoid/reduce the need to travel , active travel , public 
transpor t, and provision of improvements and enhancements to the local 
network  or contributions towards necessary or relevant off -site transport 
improvement schemes.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
10.15  This Local Plan is accompanied by a Strategic Transport Assessment which has 
identified five key locations  on the road network where mitigation measures are needed 
to address the cumulative impact on the highway network from the scale and location of 
development proposed in the Local Plan up to 2037. These locations are : 
• Parkway/Leafy Lane  (Winchester City Council area) ; 
• A27 The Avenue/Redlands Lane/Gudge Heath Lane;  
• Warsash Road/Abshot Road;  
• Delme Roundabout; and,  
• A27 The Av enue/Bishopsfield Road.  
  
10.16  Where applications are shown to impact on one or more of these junctions identified in 
the Strategic Transport Assessment, contributions will be sought to deliver mitigation 
schemes  in line with Policy TIN2 . The Parkway/Le afy Lane junction  does not warrant a 
mitigation scheme for increased junction capacity  because the junction arm leads to a 
20 mph zone, residential area with vertical speed reduction measures. This scheme wil l 
therefor e require an environmental based traff ic constraints solution to continue to 
reduce the likelihood of ‘rat running ’ at this location.  The nature of this scheme will require  
 
 
274 
    
further discuss ions with the local highway authority and Winchester City Council to 
establish the form of any mitigation scheme required.  
  
10.17  The Council is mindful that the Strategic Transport Assessment document represents a 
strategic level assessment and that it is only when development schemes come forward 
as a planning application that the detailed transport assessment work can be prepared 
to determine the specific impact of development. As a result, some of the transport 
infrastructure schemes may n eed amending or removing as more detailed assessment 
work is undertaken.  
  
10.18  Developments which generate a significant amount of vehicular movement , or where 
there a re potential cumulative negative effects on the highway network as a result of 
propos ed developments in close vicinity of each other,  will require a n individual  Transport 
Assessment to assess the likely impacts of the proposal119. The Highways Authority will 
require a Transport Assessment for sites larger than 50 residential units or 2,500 sqm of 
commercial floorspace, or where there are potential cumulative effects with sites lower 
than these thresholds.  
  
10.19  The Transport Assessment should reflect the scale of the development being proposed, 
the impact on the strategic and local highway network and identify measures which can 
be put in place to reduce its impact to an acceptable degree. Local requirements should 
also be taken into consideration; information on these requirements can be viewed on 
the Fareham Borough Council website . The Council will seek mitigation by means of on -
site delivery or financial contributions through legal agreements (section 278 agreements 
or section 106 agreements) towards improvements to local transport network 
improvements.  
  
 Safeguarded Routes   
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
10.20  Fareham Borough Council is working with neighbouring authorities (Portsmouth City 
Council, Gosport Borough Council, Havant Borough Council and Hampshire County 
Council), to address the performance and sustainability constraints on the existing 
transport network and build upon the success of the existing Rapid Transit services . This 
is to support housing and employment growth, not only in Fareham but the South -East 
Hampshire region.   
  
10.21  With a fo cus on serving both key current and future anticipated commuting markets, and 
in response to the need to enhance the transport network and public transport proposition 
in the sub -region, proposals for further development of the Rapid Tran sit offer are bein g 
developed. The aim is to deliver improved cross -mode and cross -authority integration 
with the introduction of fast and reliable Rapid Transit services that are recognised to 
genuinely offer an d enhanced service and experience from conventional bus servic es. 
  
10.22  To deliver the vision for Rapid Transit across the Borough and sub -region, the Council 
and Highway Authority will need to protect and enhance the routes and links to Rapid 
Transit services .  
 
 
119 https://www.hants.gov.uk/transport/developers/transportassessments   
 
 
275 
    
  
 Policy  TIN3: Safeguarded Routes  
 
Development will not be permitted : 
 
Where proposals may compromise the ability of the Highway Authority to deliver 
public transport highway interventions at the safeguarded locations as shown on 
the Policy map at: Delme Roundabout, the A27 from Delme Roundabout to 
Portsmouth boundary, Quay Street Roundabout and Fareham Bus Station . 
 
 How this policy works  
  
10.23 The Council seek s to safeguard land to provide  a high quality, integrated and sustainable 
transport system which contributes to a reduction in demands on the existing network.  
To aid the delivery of the South East Hampshire Rapid Transit scheme to improve access 
to Fareham and Gosport this Plan will s upport the delivery of highway interventions at 
the following locations:  
 
Fareham Bus Station  
• Interventions between Quay Street and Fareham Bus Station to avoid Quay Street 
roundabout;  
• Redeveloped bus station and improved interchange;  
 
Fareham Delme Roundabout  
• Bus infrastructure interventions to avoid peak hour queues;  
• Increased highway capacity to aid both general traffic and buses;  
• New bus lane onto roundabout from East Street;  
 
Fareham – Portchester corridor  
• Bus priority along A27 in the form of bu s lanes, bus gates and priority at junctions;  
• Shared use path along A27 corridor;  
 
Current Castle Street Roundabout  
• Alterations to existing road layout;  
• Removal of subways and replacement crossings;  
• East-west bus lanes with bus gates at junctions  
 
Portches ter – Cosham corridor  
• Bus priority along A27 in form of bus lanes, bus gates and priority at junctions  
• New pedestrian and cycle link across M275 link road  
  
10.24  These routes (as shown on the Policies map) will be safeguarded from any development 
that would compromise the ability of the Highway Authority to deliver the identified public 
transport interventions. The Council will support applications that contribute to the 
provision of a high quality, integrated and sustainable public tra nsport system  including 
future extensions of the SEHRT network to the west of Fareham towards Segensworth, 
Swanwick Station, Whiteley and the North Whiteley major development area and to serve 
the Solent Enterprise Zone at Daedalus and adjacent coastal set tlements . Applications  
 
 
276 
    
will be required to ensure the integrity of these sites is not impacted and contribute to the 
provision or delivery of local walking and cycling links to the route.  
  
 Infrastructure Delivery  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
10.25  Development proposed in the Local Plan will have a likely impact upon infrastructure 
provision in the Borough. In complying with national planning policy, it is important that 
the Council sets out its strategic priorities for the Borough  in the Local  Plan, including the 
provision of infrastructure  required to support local plan development . Paragraph 20 of 
the NPPF requires Local Plans to make sufficient provision for infrastructure through 
policy. The definition of infrastructure includes transport, telecommunications, security, 
waste management, water supply, wastewater, flood risk and coastal change 
management, and the provision of minerals and energy. In addition, the framework states 
that community facilities (such as health, education and cultura l infrastructure) should 
also be sufficiently planned for. The Council recognises that it is important that the 
necessary infrastructure is provided for to support the Borough’s housing and 
employment delivery targets.   
  
10.26  Local planning authorities are required to work alongside other authorities and 
infrastructure providers to assess the quality and capacity of infrastructure for their areas 
and identify any deficits and requirements along with opportunities for addressing  them. 
The Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) published in support of this Plan provides an  
assessment of all types of infrastructure potential impacts as a result of the Local Plan  
and the potential sources of funding identified to support the delivery of  housing , 
employment and retail for  the Borough  to 203 7.  
  
10.27  All developments (excluding householder applications)  will be required to contribute to 
the delivery of supporting infrastructure identified in the IDP, through either on site 
provision (s ection 278 works in the case of highways) or financial contributions to off -site 
mitigation. Financial contributions will be sought through the Community Infrastructure 
Levy and Section 106 developer contributions to fund improvements to existing or new 
infrastructure.  
  
10.28  As a live evidence document, the IDP will be regularly monit ored and amended to reflect 
any changes in circumstances regarding the provision of infrastructure.  The Council will 
continue to work with infrastructure providers and stakeholders to assess the quality and 
capacity of its infrastructure which should also take account of the need for strategic 
infrastructure including that of national significance.  
  
 Strategic  Policy  TIN4: Infrastructure Delivery  
 
Development s (excluding householder applications) will be required to provide 
and contribute towards the delivery of new or improved infrastructure , or other 
mitigation,  to mitigate the impacts of the development . Planning permission will 
be granted where:  
a) The new or improved infrastructure will be delivered at a rate, scale and 
pace taking account of phasing on larger schemes, to mitigate the impacts  
arising from the de velopment; and   
 
 
277 
    
 
b) The new or improved infrastructure will be provided on -site as an integral 
part of the development , unless the nature of the provision is better 
provided off -site. 
  
 How this policy works  
  
10.29  All new development is required to deliver the necessary infrastructure that  is needed to 
mitigate the impact of the development. The NPPF and Planning Policy Guidance require 
planning authorities to identify the infrastructure requirements to support deve lopment, 
as well as how they will be funded and brought forward.  Other mitigation, other than 
infrastructure, and including financial contributions, may be required to make the 
development acceptable, for example financial contributions to meet the net ga in 
requirements of Policy NE2, where on -site provision is not possible.  
  
10.30  As part of Local Plan, an Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) has been developed  in 
collaboration with infrastructure and service providers,  which considered the current and 
forecast infrastructure requirements for a suite of infrastructure types, including transport, 
utilities, green infrastructure and water supply. The IDP schedule details the key 
infrastructure improvements required to meet the Plan’s proposals.  The IDP is a  ‘live’ 
document and will be kept under review.  
  
10.31  The Council will also continue to use the adopted Planning Obligations Supplementary 
Planning Document120 (SPD)  or future equivalent, which provides  guidance for 
developers and other interested parties on the Council’s approach to the use of Planning 
obligations to secure satisfactory development and essential infrastructure, particularly 
the level associated with on -site provision .  
  
10.32  Paragra ph 54 of the NPPF states that planning obligations (whether on -site or financial) 
should only be used where it is not possible to address unacceptable impacts through a 
planning condition. Where obligations are imposed, they should be kept to a minimum 
and only where they are necessary, relevant to planning and to the development to be 
permitted. Paragraph 56 states that obligations must only be sought where they meet all 
of the following tests:121 
a) Necessary to make the development acceptable in planning ter ms; 
b) Directly related to the development; and,  
c) Fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development.  
  
10.33  The Council recognises that in some cases, t here may be a requirement for new or 
improved infrastructure to be delivered before the development is commenced, whereas 
in other scenarios, the delivery of infrastructure will be required in line with completions 
or occupations. The Council will look to secure t he delivery and timescale for delivery of 
necessary infrastructure through suitably worded planning conditions and/or obligations 
in legal agreements . 
  
 
 
120 http://www.fareham.gov.uk/PDF/planning/local_plan/PlanningObligationsSPD.pdf  
121 Set out in Regulation 122(2) of the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010.   
 
 
278 
    
10.34  Prior to seeking any financial contributions, the Council will need to be satisfied that  
provis ion cannot be provided as part of the development.  Where required the Council 
will seek contributions via a legal agreement towards the enhancement of either on -site 
and/or off -site facilities, including strategic infrastructure in line with Regulation 12 2 of 
the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010122 and the Council’s Planning 
Obligations SPD . Where on -site provision  of infrastructure is made,  financial 
contributions or other appropriate mechanisms may also be required  for the on -going 
maintenance of that infrastructure . 
  
10.35  Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)  receipts  will be the primary mechanism for 
contributing towards the provision of Borough -wide off-site strategic infrastructure to 
support the wider infrast ructure needs of the Borough.  Section 106 legal agreements will 
be drawn up where financial contributions towards specific off -site or on -site 
infrastructure  works are required to mitigate the impact of the development.  
  
10.36  CIL spending priorities are set out in the Infrastructure Funding Statement (IFS) 
published by the Council annually, starting in December 2020. The IFS will set out the 
anticipated funding from developer contributions, CIL and s106, and the choices the 
Council has made  about how these contributions will be used. This will demonstrate the 
delivery of infrastructure throughout the plan -period. Fareham Borough Council is 
required to publish a statement annually, from December 2020 onwards, supporting the 
development of the  Local Plan.  
  
10.37  To ensure that the scale of development and site allocations set out in the  Local Plan are 
deliverable, the IDP specifies the type of planning obligations required. Where 
applications are made in accordance with Plan policy, they will be assumed to be viable. 
As stated in paragraph 57 of the NPPF, it is up to the applicant to dem onstrate whether 
circumstances justify the need for a viability assessment at the application stage.  
  
10.38  Other sources of funding for the provision of off -site infrastructure may also be available 
such as Government , non -departmental public body and LEP funding. The Council will 
continue to work with statutory bodies and organisations which provide infrastructure 
funding to facilitate social cohesion, environmental improvements and economic growth 
to the benefit of t he Borough and wider sub -region.  
  
10.39  Developers will be required to undertake early engagement with the Council as well as 
other infrastructure providers in advance of proposals being submitted to ensure the 
infrastructure that is needed to serve th e site is provided.  Where practical , the possibility 
of sharing infrastructure facilities should be fully explored. For example, this  could include  
telecommunications companies utilising existing masts,  health care provi sion linked to a 
community hall  or a school providing additional opportunities for community use  or adult 
learning. Proposals for new infrastructure will need to be fully justified where 
opportunities for utilising or sharing existing infrastructure are identified. All infrastructure 
provis ion will be expected to be appropriately designed in accordance with  the wider 
policy objectives of this Plan.

279 
    
10.40  Development deemed to be CIL liable will be expected to pay in compliance with the 
adopted CIL Charging Schedule123 and CIL Instalments Policy124. Where financial 
contributions will be sought through Section 106 agreements, as set out in the policies in 
this plan, this will be progressed alongside the Planning Application process.

 High Quality Design and Placemaking   
  
11.1 Fareham Borough has developed significantly over the last hundred  years and continues 
to grow , responding to development need and pressure . Distinct and attractive 
settlements, neighbourhoods and places have been created  and new ones are being 
planned and designed.  The Council recognises that  a key part of the strategy to deliver 
buildings , spaces and places in the right locations that people want to live, work, visi t, and 
invest in, is to ensure that all new development achieve s high quality design .  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
11.2 The National Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF) states  that achieving high quality 
buildings and places is fundamental to the planning and development process.  It 
recognises that achieving high quality in the design of buildings and spaces  will help to 
deliver the economic, social and environmental objectives of sustainability. Such 
development will be beneficial in its own right but will also lead to improvements in the 
quality of the existing environment and the health and well -being of its users . 
  
11.3 The NPPF, as supported by Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) , and the National Design 
Guid ance (NDG)  and the National Model Design Code  (NMDC) , states that that t he design 
quality of new development is more than just the appearance, form, materials and detail 
of buildings. It includes the arrangement  of buildings within a layout,  how close together 
they are , the spaces in between  buildings , the views and vistas they create, landscap e 
and planting , biodiversity, other uses and activities, the richness of users’ experience both 
visual and aural, and how they connect with existing and proposed essential services and 
facilities.  National guidance also includes directions on how buildings and spaces  must be 
able to cope with the effects of climate change, including the impacts of severe weather 
and be designed and constructed to reduce the causes of a changing climate.   
  
11.4 The NDG  and NMDC , in support of the NPPF and PPG provides more detailed guidance 
on the key characteristics of what constitutes well -designed development and the pre -
conditions that deliver quality places. These are set out under the following headings:   
• context  
• identity  
• built form  
• movement  
• nature  
• public spaces  
• uses  
• homes and buildings  
• resources  
• lifespan  
  
11.5 All of  these characteristics need to be considered and combined to ensure the delivery of 
high-quality development. The extent to which all characteristics are relevant will depend 
on the scale and nature of a development proposal.  Each of the characteristics an d 
associated design and development criteria is explained and set out below.  
  
   
 
282 
 
 Context  
  
11.6 Understanding the nature of a place is essential to ensuring that the design of new 
development within or related to it, is responsive to that context. Analysing the character 
of a place includes many elements, which are applicable to a greater or lesser extent 
depending on the scale and sensitivity of a proposal and its location. These existing 
elements include:  
  
11.7 • Layout and spaciousness including 
views inwards and outwards  
• The pattern of uses and activities 
including flood risk  
• Built form and architecture, 
including scale, proportion, 
materials and detailing  
• Environment including landscape 
and visual impact, microclimate, 
flood risk  
noise, air and water quality  
• Ecology, habitat and biodiversity  
 • Landscape  character including 
topography, planting, drainage and visual 
impact  
• Access, movement, accessibility and 
connectivity  
• The function of place now and in the future 
including demographics, economy and the 
aspirations, concerns and perceptions of 
local communities  
 
 
  
11.8 A well-designed, contextual development  demonstrate s that it is:  
• based on a sound understanding of the features of the site and the surrounding 
context, that should include those identified above; and 
• integrated into their surroundings so it relates well to them;  and 
• influenced by and influence their context positively;  and 
• responsive to loca l history, culture and heritage  
  
 Identity  
  
11.9 Creating places that the user experiences as attractive, memorable, distinctive and of 
strong character are well designed places. The identity of a development, whether one 
new home or a new office block will be derived from an appropriate response to the site’s 
context, including the architectural language of a building. The response should focus on 
the important and high quality, positive design attributes and characteristics of existing 
adjacent places. Where adjacent places are not well designed, a new distinctive identity 
of place and architectural language can be created through the nature of the landscape 
and the site’s location, whether the site is on the edge of existing settlements or within 
existing suburban or town centres. The strength of identi ty will come from how the different 
built elements and the spaces in between are brought together, in a coherent and 
attractive manner. There are many such elements, including:  
• the composition of street scenes, individual buildings and their detailing ; and 
• the height, scale, massing and relationships between buildings;  and 
• views, vistas and landmarks and roofscapes;  and 
• the degree of symmetry and variety of building facades, the pattern and 
proportions of their windows , doors,  details and materials,  and 
• planting, colours, textures, shapes and patterns , including the architectural 
language of individual buildings . 
   
 
283 
 
11.10  The way a development functions and contributes to an existing place also creates a 
strength of identity. Creating a coherent attractive place that appeals to all the user’s 
senses, encourages and prioritises walking and cycling as a mode of movement will be a 
well-designed place. By contrast development shou ld avoid being a place that is 
dominated by vehicular access and movement priority.  
  
 Built Form   
  
11.11  Built form is the three -dimensional pattern or arrangement and scale of development 
blocks, streets, buildings and open spaces.  The pattern should be coherent and attractive. 
At a smaller scale it is the shape and proportion of extensions or other additions to 
individual buildings.  
  
11.12  Well-designed buildings, spaces and places are derived from an appropriate analysis of 
context, taking on the surrounding area’s positive design attributes. Well-designed places 
will also have:  
• compact forms of development that are walkable, contributing p ositively to well -
being and placemaking;  and 
• accessible local public transport, services and facilities, to ensure  a high level of  
sustainab ility; and 
• recognisable streets and other spaces with their edges defined by buildings, 
making it easy for anyone t o find their way around, and promoting safety and 
accessibility; and  
• memorable features or groupings of buildings, spaces, uses or activities that create 
a sense of place, promoting inclusion and cohesion  for all users . 
  
 Movement  
  
11.13  Moving to and from a development, linking key services and facilities, leisure and 
employment destinations, as well as movement corridors within new development, are all 
essential elements to well -designed places. Movement takes place in a variety of public 
spaces i ncluding roads, streets, squares and foot/cycle paths and, whilst they must be 
functional, they must also be visually attractive, follow existing and new desire lines, but 
allow for passive activity and social interaction.  
  
11.14  Well-designed places will have  movement corridors that create a coherent pattern and 
hierarchy  and: 
• are safe and accessible for all;  and 
• function efficiently to get everyone around, taking account of the diverse needs of 
all its potential users and provide s a genuine choice of sustainable transport 
modes;  and 
• limits the impacts of car use by prioritising and encouraging walking, cycling and 
public transport, mitigating impacts and identifying opportunities to improve air 
quality;  and 
• promotes activity and social interaction, contributing to health, well -being, 
improved accessibility and inclusion; and  
• incorporates green infrastructure, including street trees to soften the visual impact 
of built form and car parking, help improve air qu ality and contribute to biodiversity.  
  
   
 
284 
 
 Nature  
  
11.15  Bringing nature into new development is both a functional and visual element in delivering 
quality to place making. Planting and associated management creates habitat and 
biodiversity, can support drainage systems and helps to combat climate change. 
Appropriate planting softens built form and enhances the attractiveness and quality of 
streets and spaces, helping the well -being and health of users. It is critical therefore t hat 
such planting and habitat creation is designed with optimal space and conditions so th at 
it will be robust in the long term and allow for proper maintenance and management.  
Native species should be used to generate optimal biodiversity net gain , particularly with 
regard to trees, hedgerows and natural greenspace.  
  
11.16  Well-designed places:  
• positively integrate existing, and incorporate new natural features into a 
multifunctional network that supports quality of place, biodiversity and water 
management, and addresses climate change mitigation and resilience;  and 
• prioritise nature so that diverse ecosystems can flourish to ensure a healthy natural 
environment that su pports and enhances biodiversity;  and 
• provide attractive open spaces in locations that are easy to access, with activities 
for all to enjoy, such as play, food production, recreation and sport, so as to 
encourage physical activity and promote health, well -being and social inclusion . 
  
 Public Spaces  
  
11.17  Public space  has many forms and scales and is more than public parks or open spaces. 
Public space includes, roads, streets, squares and other hard surfaced incidental spaces. 
They should be visually attractive, include planting and a variety of habitats, connected to 
desire lines as well as being safe and secure for all users. Public space should be 
designed to be the focus and the heart of new development, ensuring priority for people.  
  
11.18  Well-designed places:  
• include well -located public spaces that support a wide variety of activities and 
encourage social interaction, to promote health, well -being, social and civic 
inclusion;  and 
• have a hierarchy of spaces that range from large and strategic to small and local 
spaces, including parks, squares, greens  and pocket parks ; and  
• have public spaces that feel safe, secure and attractive for all to use . This includes 
ensuring that:  
o spaces are overlooked and are fronted by buildings, not located to the rear ; 
and 
o buildings create the edge to a space with active f rontages that have their 
entrances as well as their principal windows and balconies fronting; and  
o have trees and other planting within public spaces for people to enjoy, 
whilst also providing shading, and air quality and climate change mitigation ; 
and 
o Have high quality street furniture, including seats, benches, light columns, 
notice boards, bollards and fencing that are visually attractive in their own 
right, complimentary to one another as well as functionally appropriate . 
  
  
  
 
285 
 
Uses  
  
11.19  High quality design helps to create sustainable places, which include a mix of uses that 
support everyday activities to live, work and play. It is important that the scale and nature 
of such uses is commensurate with the development and does not undermine the retail 
hierarchy and the vitality and viability of existing nearby centres or facilities. New 
neighbourhoods require a range of local services and facilities including schools, 
nurseries, workplaces, healthcare, spiritual, recreational, community and c ommercial 
uses. These should be co -located to create a focus and heart for the neighbourhood, 
vibrancy and social interaction. Such places will also require a variety of housing tenure 
to create mixed, integrated and flexible accommodation over time.  
  
11.20 It is recognised that not all development will contain a mix of uses due to their scale, such 
as for small scale development and householder extensions. However, where new 
housing development is proposed, the Council will ensure that it is located so that it is well 
related and connected to existing centres and areas of mixed use activity, helping them to 
be vibrant and viable, and helping to support local public transport services.  
  
11.21  Well-designed places have:  
• a mix of uses including local services and facilities to support daily life;  and 
• an integrated mix of housing tenures and types to suit people at all stages of life; 
and 
• well-integrated housing and other facilities that are designed to be tenure neutral 
and socially inc lusive.  
   
 Homes and buildings  
  
11.22  Homes and other buildings provide the internal and associated external environments in 
which people live , work , play and visit. Ensuring that the environment is of a high quality, 
in terms of space, temperature, noise, air, light, and access all combine to ensure optimal 
conditions to support the health and well -being of their users and deliver sustainable 
develop ment. Homes and buildings must also be of a form, materials and detailing that 
are visually attractive and sit comfortably within and add to the quality and character of 
public space, as well as shared or private gardens, parking and servicing space.  
  
11.23  Well-designed homes and buildings:  
• provide good quality internal and external environments for their users, promoting 
health and well -being;  and 
• relate positively to the private, shared and public spaces around them, contributing 
to social interactio n and inclusion; and  
• resolve the details of operation and servicing so that they are unobtrusive and well -
integrated into their neighbourhoods.  
  
 Resources  
  
11.24  New buildings and places contribute directly and indirectly to greenhouses gases and 
climate change. The embodied energy in construction and manufacture, operational 
energy use and the location, form and connectivity of new development by motorised 
vehicles all play a part. High q uality buildings and places conserve natural  resources 
including land, water, energy and materials.  Their design responds  and adapts  to the 
impacts of climate change.   
 
286 
 
  
11.25  Well-designed places  have a layout, form and mix of uses that reduces their resource 
requirement  for land, energy and water . This approach means that designs:  
• creat e compact and attractive forms and in convenient, connected locations that 
encourage walking and cycling and reduce the need to travel by motorised 
transport;  and 
• are orientated to take advantage of natural resources and renewable energy  
utilising passive design strategies;  and 
• have planting  to create shade and shelter for their users, improve air quality, 
mitigate the effects of pollution and reduce the heat island effect.  and 
• utilise green sustainable urban drainage systems to create habitats, biodiversity 
and improved water quality, as well as controlling surface water runoff ; and   
• are fit for purpose and adaptable over time, reducing the need for redevelopm ent 
and unnecessary waste;  and 
• use materials and adopt technologies to minimise their environmental impact . 
  
 Lifespan  
  
11.26  The use of quality materials, appropriate structural design and construction technique, 
together with suitable  planting and on -going stewardship and maintenance are elements 
that need to be carefully combined to ensure enduring high -quality buildings, spaces and 
places. Long term attractiveness relies on these elements whilst also needing to be 
functionally effici ent. This does not mean that low -cost, low maintenance, is the overriding 
factor in design and decision making. The use of natural materials, that weather well and 
retain their attractiveness with minimal maintenance have been used extensively and well 
in Fareham over time.  
  
11.27  Well-designed places, buildings and spaces are:  
• designed and planned for long -term stewardship by landowners, communities and 
local authorities from the earliest stages;  and 
• robust, easy to use and look after, and enable their users to establish a sense of 
ownership and belonging, ensuring places and buildings age gracefully;  and 
• adaptable to their users’ changing needs and evolving technologies; and  
• well-managed and maintained by their users, owners, landlords and public 
agencies.  
  
 Policy D1 : High Quality Design and Place Making  
  
Development proposals and spaces will be of high quality, based on the principles  
of urban design and sustainability to ensure the creation of quality  
places.  
 
Development proposals will be permitted where compliance with the following  
key characteristics of high quality design, as set out in paragraphs 11.5 -11.27,  
has been demonstrated:   
i. Context - where proposals appropriately respond to the positive 
elements of local character, ecology, history, culture and heritage ; and  
ii. Identity - where proposals create places that are attractive, memorable, 
distinctive and of strong chara cter; and   
 
287 
 
iii. Built form - where proposals create a three -dimensional pattern or 
arrangement and scale of development blocks, streets, buildings and 
open spaces, that are coherent, attractive and walkable;  and 
iv. Movement - where proposals create attractive, safe  and accessible 
corridors that incorporate green infrastructure and link with key 
services and facilities along existing and future desire lines, which 
promote social interaction and activity;  and 
v. Nature - where proposals positively integrate existing and new habitats 
and biodiversity within a coherent and well managed, connected 
structure;  and 
vi. Public spaces - where proposals create public spaces that are 
attractive, safe, accessible and provide a focus for social interaction, 
and promote healthy activity and well -being;  and 
vii. Uses - where proposals provide or are well related and connected with, 
a mix of uses that provide the day to day needs of users;  and 
viii. Homes and buildings - where proposals provide a variety of dwelling 
sizes and tenures, have su fficient space and are well related to public 
space;  and 
ix. Resources - where proposals reduce the use of natural resources, 
conserve and enhance and integrate habitats and ecosystems and are 
adaptable over time, minimising waste;  and 
x. Lifespan - where proposa ls are designed and constructed to create 
enduring high -quality buildings, spaces and places that are attractive 
and functional, which weather well and can be adapted to users' needs 
with efficient management and maintenance.  
  
  How this policy works  
  
11.28  The quality of buildings, spaces and places will be assessed at all scales and having 
regard  to all users. Quality design will be at the heart of the Council’s decisions, from the 
location of new development at a strategic level through to the design and appearance of 
buildings and spaces, their details, landscaping and how they are to be managed and 
maintained for the long term . 
  
11.29  The Council will use the criteria set out in policy D1 and detai led and explained in 
paragraphs 11.5-11.27  to assess whether development proposals are accep table. The 
Council will need to understand how a proposal has met the criteria. There will be an 
expectation for applicants to demonstrate their approach within sub mitted supporting 
documents such as a Design and Access Statement  for major developments or those in 
Conservation Areas , responding to each criterion as necessary.  
  
11.30  The extent of analysis and explanatory material should be proportionate to the nature, size 
and sensitivit y of the site and the proposal . 
  
11.31  This policy should be considered in conjunction with more detailed related policies set out 
in the Plan. In particular, Policy NE6  Trees, woodland and Hedgerows, Policy CC2: 
Managing Flood Risk and Sustainable Drainage Systems, Policy CC3 Coastal Change 
Management Areas, Policy CC4: Renewable and Low Carbon Energy , Policy D4 Water  
 
288 
 
Quality and Resources, Policy TIN1  Sustainable Transport  and Policy TIN4  Infrastructure 
Delivery .   
  
11.32  In addition to Local Plan Policies, the Council will have regard to the Fareham Borough 
Design Guide SPD  and other existing and future SPDs in the assessment and 
determination of planning applications where they apply . 
  
11.33  Where appropriate within the Local Plan period, the Council will develop additional design 
guidance relating to specific sites, settlements or borough  wide. Such guidance could 
include  site or area -wide masterplans, design codes or guidance related to specific issues, 
such as parking. These will be developed in conjunction with local residents and the wider 
community, where applicable , and in conformity with  any relevant existing or future 
national or sub -regional policy or guidance.  This includes Building for Healthy Life 12125 , 
which will be used as an assessment tool for major new development  and the future 
National Model  Design Code  and the future revised Manual for Streets , which is due for 
consultation before the end of 2020.   
  
11.34  The Council will also make use of Design Review Panels, where appropriate, to provide 
independent guidance and assessment of proposals, depending on the scale, context and 
relationship to important heritage or ecological assets.  
  
11.35  Building Regulations take into account all regulated emissions arising from new residential 
development  (heating, fixed lighting and ventilation)  and energy efficiency standards , but 
the Council will support planning applications that exceed Building Regulations 
requirements.  
  
11.36  It is expected that with climate change, there is to be an increase in temperatures. New 
development is therefore encouraged to be designed and laid out as such that it provides 
natural ventilation and making use of Green Infrastructure such as urban street trees to 
alleviate the urban heat island effect and the r isk of overheating from rising temperatures.  
  
 High Quality Design and Ensuring Good Environmental Conditions  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
11.37  New development should be designed to ensure that the environmental conditions of 
internal and external space support and promote good health and well -being for all users.  
  
11.38  Good environmental conditions include appropriate levels of space, light, privacy, heating, 
cooling and water quality, whilst avoiding excessive and unacceptable impacts  from noise, 
ground, air, water and light pollution or contaminants.  
  
11.39  Potential solutions to overcome identified excessive environmental conditions must be 
acceptable in their own right having regard to local plan policies. For example, such 
solutions should not have an adverse visual impact in the landscape or streetscape o r 
result in overbearing or overshadowing effects.  
  
 
125 Building for Healthy Life: Design Toolkit for neighbourhoods, streets, homes and public spaces (Homes England July 
2020)   
 
289 
 
11.40  Proposals for residential accommodation126 should provide a suitable living environment 
for existing and future occupiers and users, including appropriate external amenity space 
in line with the re quirements of the  Fareham  Borough Design Guide SPD. Developments 
that do not achieve acceptable living standards are often symptomatic o f 
overdevelopment, poor design, an inappropriate location for housing or a combination of 
these. New developments with h abitable rooms should secure adequate internal space to 
comply with the national described space standards  in accordance with Policy D5127. New 
development should also receive adequate daylight and sunlight128 to create satisfactory 
living and working accomm odation. This is particularly important in certain residential 
rooms such as bedrooms and living rooms.  
  
11.41  Applicants for new residential development should be aware of the requirements of Policy 
HP7: Adaptable and Accessible Dwellings in Chapter 5, which outlines 
adaptability/accessibility standards on new dwellings. Policy H P7 also requires a 
percentage of dw ellings for large scale development129 as Category 3 of Part M (Access 
to and Use of Buildings) of the Building Regulations (2015 edition). Category 1 acts a 
minimum for residential development.  
  
 Policy D2: Ensuring Good Environmental  Conditions  
 
Development must ensure  good environmental  conditions  for all new and existing 
users of buildings and external space . 
 
Development propos als, including changes of use,  will be permitted where they : 
 
a) Do not have a n unacceptable adverse impact on  the environmental 
conditions  of future  occupiers and users or on adjacent/nearby occupant s 
and users  through ensuring appropriate outlook and ventilation and 
providing adequate daylight, sunlight and privacy; and  
b) Do not, individually, or cumulati vely, have a n unacceptable  adverse  
environmental  impact, either on neighbouring occupants, adjoining land, or 
the wider environment ; and  
c) Can demonstrate that the future occupants and users of the development site 
will not be unacceptably adversely impacted from existing activities in the 
surrounding area.   
  
 How this policy works  
  
11.42  Proposals for new development will be assessed through appropriate and suitably 
qualified internal and external persons, using industry accepted methodologies, systems 
and procedures to determine the future environmental conditions resulting from proposals . 
Proposals that are assessed to be likely to have a significant adverse impact on occupiers’ 
or users’ health and well-being  will not be permitted.  Assessments will also be required 
 
126 ‘Residential accommodation’ goes beyond the definition of a C3 use class ‘dwellinghouse’. Whilst not exhaustive this 
can also includ e hotels, residential institutions and houses of multiple occupancy (HMOs).       
127 Nationally Described Space Standards  (MHCLG – March 2015 and as amended)  
128 Where necessary, in addition to guidance set out in the Fare ham Borough Design Guide SPD, the use of ‘Site Layout 
Planning for Daylight and Sunlight – A Guide to Good Practice’. Building Research Establishment (Sep 2011) or a 
suitable and agreed computer model will be used to assess the potential impact upon daylig ht, sunlight and shadowing.  
129 Schemes of over 100 dwellings (gross)   
 
290 
 
where there is the potential for unacceptable adverse impact from existing activities that 
may impact on the development site.  This includes but is not limited to flightpaths, 
commercial uses and the highway network.  
  
11.43  Adverse environmental  impacts include , but are not limited to, contamination, noise, heat, 
liquids, vibration, light or air pollution, or excessive wind (including dust, smoke, fumes or 
odour).  
  
 Coordination and Piecemeal Development  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
11.44  Coordination of development within and adjacent to existing settlements  and as part of 
area wide development strategies and masterplans  is vital to ensure that developments 
are sustainable , appropriately planned and designed . It can ensure that land and other 
resources are used efficiently, avoid duplication, locat ed optimally, connect people, places 
and habitat, and equalise value. It can also avoid piecemeal development and associated 
sterilisation of land and development delivery.  
  
11.45  
 Circumstances where coordination is required include:  
• Connecting separate site ownership and associated development though 
pedestrian cycle and vehicle corridors, increasing permeability and avoiding 
segregated cul -de-sac forms  
• Ensuring integration and connection of existing and new biodiversity and habitats;  
• The provision of open space, sport and play facilities  
• Shared parking and servicing arrangements.  
• Provision of infrastructure including drainage, energy, health, education,  shops 
and community space  
• Phasing of development over time . 
  
 Policy D3: Coordination of Development and Piecemeal Proposals  
 
Where proposals come forward that are part of a wider development site , 
supporting information  will be expected to demonstrate that the proposal will not 
prejudice the appropriate development of the adjoining site (s) in accordance with 
Local Plan policies, and that the proposal maximises place -making opportunities.  
Development proposals that prevent or limit  the potential for appropriately 
developing an adjoining site , or which do not maximise connectivity , permeability 
and efficiency opportunities or address mitigation and infrastructure needs 
relating to the wider  development, will not be permitted . 
 
Where piecemeal development could delay or prevent the comprehensive 
development of a larger site, a legal agreement will be sought, to ensure that any 
permitted development does not prejudice the development of adjace nt land.  
 
Applications which seek to evade infrastructure provision (including affordable 
housing) by not fully maximising the use of the site or by putting forward piecemeal 
development will not be supported.  
  
   
 
291 
 
How this policy works  
  
11.46  Proposals for new development will be assessed to ensure that uncoordinated and 
piecemeal development is avoided. The Council, separately or in combination with 
developers will demonstrate, through suitably scaled and detailed masterplans, parameter 
plans and design codes, or other suitable process and product, how development parcels 
and separate land ownerships should be developed comprehensively. The Council will 
use conditions of planning consent together with appropriately worded legal agreements, 
to deliver all aspects of a wider development.  
  
 The Water Environment  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
11.47  The sustainable management and improvement of the Borough’s water environment is 
highly important. An improved water environment will have benefits for Fareham’s 
residents, visitors and business and positively contribute towards conserving and 
enhancing the natural environment including biodiversity net gain. The most recent 
available data from the Environment Agency130 suggests that the water  bodies in and 
around Fareham are of moderate status. The objective is to restore these waterbodies to  
good status and the Council has a role in helping to achieve this objective by ensuring that 
there is no deterioration of the water environment as a resu lt of planned development and 
where possible, look to enhance it . 
  
11.48  It is essential that the Council ensures new development protects and enhances water 
quality and existing resources where such opportunities arise. Existing water resources 
that need protecting include the Source Protection Zone (the underlying chalk aquifer) in 
Wallington, the four rivers and their associated tributaries in the Borough and the many 
other standalone water habitats (lakes ponds and streams) which are  also present. 
Enhancements from development can include the creation or funding of specific water 
projects and/or the implementation of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), in 
accordance with Policy CC2 Flood Risk and Sustainable Drainage Systems  
  
11.49  The conservation and management of water as a resource is an important factor for 
consideration in new development and developers should implement schemes which 
make the most efficient use of water.  As set out in government guidance, the Council has 
the option to set additional technical requirements on exceeding the minimum standard 
required by Building Regulations in respect of water efficiency.  The Environment Agency’s 
report on Water Stressed Areas (July 2013) in the UK concluded that areas covere d, by 
Southern Water, such as parts of the Fareham Borough are in an area of serious water 
stress131. In addition, increased water efficiency can help towards reducing the impact of 
development on water quality. As a result, the Council consider the Optiona l Technical 
Housing Standard for Water efficiency of no more than 110 litres per person per day to be 
applicable across the whole Borough in order to help tackle water quality as well as 
conserving water as a resource.

292 
 
 Water Quality  
  
11.50  Fareham Borough has 8.5km of open coastal frontage, 14.5km of frontage on the tidal 
River Hamble and 11.5km of frontage onto Portsmouth Harbour. The Rivers Wallington 
and Meon also flow through the Borough.  
  
11.51  The South -East River Basin Management Plan (2015) identifies  significant water 
management issues in the South -East river basin district including pollutions from 
wastewater  (e.g. phosphorous and nitrates). The priority issues in the East Hampshire 
catchment are diffuse pollution, heavily modified river channels, reducing fish habitat and 
passage and landfill sites near protected areas.  
  
11.52  The findings of the PfSH Inte grated Water Management Study (2018)132 show that Peel 
Common Wastewater  Treatment Works (WwTW) will receive increased flows of sewerage 
effluent from development in Fareham. Although no significant impact or deterioration is 
predicted due to future housing growth, the Peel Common WwTW will require 
improvements by 2025 to incr ease capacity in the WwTW and sewer network upgrades . 
The Solent catchment which Peel Common WwTW discharges into, is noted to already 
have nitrate problems with Nitrate Vulnerable Zones being designated in the area by the 
Environment Agency. Catchment lev el nitrate measures are required now to tackle the 
various sources of nitrate pollution which include from agriculture, sewage effluent and 
coastal background sources.   Policy NE4 relates directly to the issue of nutrient neutrality 
and impacts into the So lent. 
  
 Policy D4: Water Quality and Resources  
 
The Council together with its partners will seek to improve water quality and 
manage the use of water resources by ensuring development proposals provide 
for the satisfactory supply and disposal of surface and wastewater . Development 
proposals must not be detrimental to the management and protection of river, 
coastal and groundwater  (including Source Protection Zones) . Opportunities to 
enhance these resources in line with the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 
objectives will be supported . 
 
To minimise impact on the water environment and adapt to climate change, all new 
dwellings shall achieve  as a minimum  the Optional Technical Housing Standard 
for Water efficiency of no more than 110 litres per person per day. Development  
that achieve s a higher technical  standard of 100 litres per person per day , including 
the use of grey water recycling,  will be supported.   
  
 How this policy works  
  
11.53  Development proposals should demonstrate that there is adequate wastewater 
infrastructure and water supply capacity to serve the development or adequate provision 
can be made available.  Applicants should provide a connection at the nearest point of 
adequa te capacity in the sewerage network in collaboration with Southern Water.  
  
 
132 http://www.fareham.gov.uk/PDF/planning/local_plan/PUSH_IWMSFinalReport -Redacted.pdf    
 
293 
 
11.54  The optional technical standard in relation to water resources of requiring 110 litres per 
person per day will be applied by planning condition to all new dwellings.  It is recognised 
that the water supply companies (Southern Water and Portsmouth Water) have targeted 
aspirations to get personal water consumption down to 100 litres per person per day. 
Therefore,  the policy requirement for 110 litres per person  per day is a minimum 
requirement  and development throughout the plan period should be encouraged to 
achieve the higher standard of 100 litres per person per day where possible.  
  
11.55  In respect of non -residential standards, developments will be supported that meet  
BREEAM standards  where viable. Developers that propose a scheme to meet BREEAM 
standards  in order to demonstrate the sustainability benefits of their proposals should  
submit a post construction assessment and BREEAM certificate to the local planning 
authority to demonstrate compliance. The requirement for BREEAM standards will be 
considered as part of a review of the next Local Plan.  
  
11.56  In respect of non -residential standards, developments will be supported that meet  
BREEAM standards  where viable. Developers that propose a scheme to meet BREEAM 
standards  in order to demonstrate the sustainability benefits of their proposals should  
submit a post construction assessment and BREEAM certificate to the local planning 
authority to demonstrate compliance. The requirement for BREEAM standards will be 
considered as part of a review of the next Local Plan.  
  
 High Quality Design and Living  Space  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
11.57  The provision of sufficient living space within new homes is an important element of high 
quality  housing design and a pre -requisite for good environmental living conditions. 
Residents of new homes should be provided with sufficient space for basic daily activities 
and needs. Setting minimum space standards helps to mitigate impacts from 
overcrowding,  particularly relating to health and wellbeing; reducing depression, giving 
children room to play within the home and helping to ensure a good night’s sleep.  Space 
should be provided for the furniture people need, to store personal possessions, to 
prepare food conveniently or to socialise with friends and family. If homes are to be robust 
and sustainable in the long term, they must offer functional and adaptable spaces that 
meet the needs of families, children, older people  and disabled residents.  
  
11.58  Subject to suitable evidence, the National Planning Practice Guidance allows local 
planning authorities to require new residential development to meet minimum internal 
space standards as set out in the Technical housing standards – nationally described 
space standard (2015 )133. The nationally described space standard is not a building 
regulation and remains solely within the planning system as a new form of technical 
planning standard and is continually updated.   
  
11.59  Evidence  collected by the Council shows that most new dwellings in the Borough are being 
built consistent with the space standards. However, certain exceptions have been 
identified. Firstly, it is often the smallest bedroom or ‘box rooms’ of dwellings which fail to  
meet the space standards for single rooms, and secondly, whilst rooms may meet the 
standards for single rooms, they are often identified as doubles. Introducing a policy will 
 
133https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/524531/160519_Na
tionally_Described_Space_Standard____ Final_Web_version.pdf    
 
294 
 
guarantee that those good practices that are prevalent today will continue and e nsure that 
rooms are delivered to the size they are required to be across the range of dwelling types 
and sizes, ensuring a good stock of homes of all sizes.  
  
11.60  There are no notable viability impacts anticipated from the introduction of a nationally 
described space standard.  
  
11.61  All new homes, including subdivisions of larger properties and conversions, will therefore 
be required to meet the nationally described space standards, unless it can be shown 
unpracticable in the face of other material considerations and policy requirements.  For 
example, the Council will consider minor reductions in the internal space standards where 
it can be demonstrated that this is necessary to ensure the repair and re -use of a heritage 
asset without u ndermining its character and fabric integrity . 
  
11.62  This approach will be carried forward in line with any subsequent standard that the 
government may introduce, pending a review of potential viability consequences when 
applied to the Borough.  
  
 Policy D5: Internal Space Standards  
 
All new dwellings,  including  subdivisions and conversions shall meet as a 
minimum the nationally described (internal) space standards (or future equivalent) 
as set out in the government’s housing technical paper: ‘Tech nical housing 
standards – nationally described space standard’ (2015).  
  
 How this policy works 
  
11.63  For all planning applications that involve residential development, the Council will assess 
the internal space of each dwelling, or part as applies against the standards and 
requirements as set out in table 11.1 and paragraphs a) to i) below. Planning appl ications 
should be accompanied by appropriate evidence and information setting out the internal 
floorspace, bedroom sizes and the extent of built -in storage for each dwelling.  
  
11.64  The technical housing standards for minimum gross internal floor areas and storage are 
set out in Table 11.1.

equipment such as a hot water cylinder, boiler or heat exchanger.  
GIAs for one storey dwellings include enough sp ace for one bathroom and one additional WC (or shower room) in 
dwellings with 5 or more bedspaces. GIAs for two and three storey dwellings include enough space for one bathroom 
and one additional WC (or shower room). Additional sanitary facilities may be i ncluded without increasing the GIA 
provided that all aspects of the space standard have been met.

 Table 11.1 Technical housing standards – nationally described space standard  
  
11.65 The standard requires that:  
a) the dwelling provides at least the gross internal floor area and built -in storage area 
set out in Table 11.1 above  
b) a dwelling with two or more bedspaces has at least one double (or twin) bedroom  
c)  in order to provide one bedspace, a single bedroom has a flo or area of at least 
7.5m2 and is at least 2.15m wide  
d) in order to provide two bedspaces, a double (or twin bedroom) has a floor area of 
at least 11.5m2 
e) one double (or twin bedroom) is at least 2.75m wide and every other double (or 
twin) bedroom is at least 2.55m wide  
f) any area with a headroom of less than 1.5m is not counted within the Gross Internal 
Area unless used solely for storage (if the area under the stairs is to be used for 
storage, assume a general floor area of 1m2 within the Gross Internal Area)  
g) any other area that is used solely for storage and has a headroom of 900 -1500mm 
(such as under eaves) is counted at 50% of its floor area, and any area lower than 
900mm is not counted at all  
h)  a built -in wardrobe counts towards the Gross Internal Area and bedroom floor area 
requirements but should not reduce the effective width of the room below the 
minimum widths set out above. The built -in area in excess of 0.72m2 in a double 
bedroom and 0.36 m2 in a single bedroom counts towards the built -in storage 
requirement  
i) the minimum floor to ceiling height is 2.3m for at least 75% of the Gross Internal 
Area.  
 
 
Where a 1b1p has a shower room instead of a bathroom, the floor area may be reduced from 39m2 to 37m2, as shown 
bracketed.  
Furnished layouts are not require d to demonstrate compliance.

 Historic Environment  
  
12.1 Planning plays an important role in  maintaining and protecting the historical environment.  
Planning policies must balance  the need for development whilst securing the 
conservation and enhancement of th is valued asset in the  Borough . Appropriate 
development  can better reveal a heritage  asset’s significance and incre ase access and 
enjoyment of the  historic environment.  
  
 National Policy and Guidance  
  
12.2 National policy and guidance place significant emphasis on the need to conserve  
heritage assets in a manner appropriate to their significance so they can be enjoyed and 
continue to contribute towards the quality of life of existing and future generations.  
  
12.3 The NPPF provides the following key definitions to assist in the understanding of the 
historic environment:  
  
12.4 The Historic Environment is defined as all aspects of the environment resulting from the 
interaction between people and places through time, including all surviving physical 
remains of past human activity, whether visible, buried or submerged, and landscaped 
and planted or managed flora.  
  
12.5 A heritage asset is defined as a building, monument, site, place, area or landscape 
identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions, 
because of its heritage interest.  
  
12.6 The significance of heritage is expressed as the value of a heritage asset to this and 
future generations because of its heritage interest. The interest may be archaeological, 
architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s 
physical presence, bu t also from its setting.   
  
12.7 The setting of a heritage asset is described as the surroundings in which a heritage asset 
is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings 
evolve. Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the 
significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or may be 
neutral.  
  
12.8 Planning Practice Guidance135 states h eritage assets may be affected by direct physical 
change or by change in their setting. Being able to properly assess the nature, extent 
and importance of the significance of a heritage asset, and the contribution of its setting, 
is very important to understanding the potential impact and acceptability of development 
proposals.  
  
12.9 Heritage a ssets are classified as ‘designated’ or non -designated’. Designated heritage 
assets include  Listed Buildings, Scheduled Monuments, Protected Wreck Sites, World 
Heritage Sites,  Conservation Areas, and Registered Parks, Gardens and Battlefields  
which are  statutorily designated under the relevant legislation.  Non-designated heritage 
assets are those which have been identified as having a degree of significance meriting 
 
135 https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conserving -and-enhancing -the-historic -environment   
 
297 
 
consideration  in planning decisions, but which are not formally designated heritage 
assets . 
  
12.10 The historic environment of Fareham includes 5 Scheduled Monuments, 13 
Conservation Areas, more than 400 statutory Listed Buildings, 200 locally listed 
buildings, 8 historic parks and gardens which have been identified as having local 
importance and a number of archaeological sites of  local importance.  
  
12.11 The principal evidence base for the historic environment for Fareham Borough is the 
Historic Environment Record136 (HER) maintained by Hampshire County Council (HCC). 
In addition to the HER, a full list of the heritage assets which are found in the Borough 
and an explanation of their categories can be found in the Heritage Historic E nvironment 
Background Paper137. (LINK ) 
  
 Historic Environment and Heritage Assets Strategic Policy  
  
 Why this policy is n eeded  
  
12.12 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) paragraph 185 sets out that plans 
should include a positive strategy or the conservation and enjoyment of the historic 
environment including heritage assets most at risk through neglect, decay or other 
threats.  
  
12.13 Fareham has a rich historic environment which contributes greatly to the character,  
diversity and distinctiveness of the Borough. The Council recognises the role this plays 
in contributing to the Borough’s sense of place and the importance of setting out a 
positive strategy for its conservation and enjoy ment by appropriately conserving  and 
enhancing the Borough’s historical assets, settings and landscapes . 
  
 Strategic Policy HE1 : Historic Environment and Heritage Assets  
 
All development should seek to conserve and enhance the historic environment 
and heritage assets, in line with local and national policy. The Council will take 
appropriate positive steps to conserve and enhance the Borough’s historic 
environment and heritage assets.  
 
  
 How this policy works  
  
12.14 Under the Council ’s positive strategy, the Council  will take action to ensure  the 
conservation and enhancement of the historic environment and  heritage assets by:  
• Applying national heritage policy as set out in the NPPF and PPG (or successor 
guidance), as well as guidance of relevance to the historic environment published 
by the govern ment or Historic England  
• Applying the non -strategic policies on designated assets (conservation areas, 
listed buildings & structures, scheduled monuments & protected wrecks) and non -
designated assets (locally -listed buildings, locally -listed parks & garden s) which 
 
136https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/environment/historicenvironment/historicenvironmentrecord   
137www.fa reham.gov.uk/PDF/planning/publicationplan/HistoricEnvironmentBackgr oundPaper -FINAL.PDF   
 
298 
 
provide additional detail for each type of heritage asset. The non -strategic policies 
should be considered additional to national policy, rather than replacement.  
• Identifying opportunities to better reveal the significance of heritage assets; and  
• Proactively seek solutions for heritage assets at risk through discussions with 
owners to secure the preservation of vulnerable and deteriorating buildings and 
other heritage assets138 through maintenance and repair, and as a last resort, 
using its statutory powers; and  
• Seeking to secure the retention of buildings of architectural or historic interest, 
including optimum viable use, where appropriate ; and  
• Provid ing guidance and advice to owners and developers of historic buildings 
and heritage assets; and  
• Keeping  the designation of Conservation Areas under review, updat ing its Local 
List and bring ing forward enhancement schemes as appropriate.  
  
 Conservation Areas  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
12.15 Conservation Areas are designated under the Town and Country Planning (Listed 
Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act . 1990 for their special architectural or historic 
interest. Once designated, legislation requires that local planning authorities act with the 
aim of protecting, preserving and, where possible, enhancing the character and 
appearance of these areas , as desi gnated heritage assets.  The demolition of buildings 
and works to tr ees are also controlled within C onservation Areas.  
  
12.16  The Borough has thirteen designated Conservation Areas  as detailed in the following 
table :

 Table 12.1: Conservation Areas  
  
12.17 The character of each area is derived from a variety of aspects including the age and 
style of individual buildings, the way groups of buildings are arranged, the spaces 
between them, their historical significance in the development of an area and also their  
 
138 Such as through an Article 4 direction   
 
299 
 
use. Other factors such as: open spaces, landscaping, trees and important views all  
combine to form the overall character of an area.  
  
 Policy HE2: Conservation Area s 
 
Development affecting a Conservation Area  (as identified on the policies map)  
should preserve or enhance the special architectural, historic character or 
appearance  of Conservation Areas by:  
 
a) Taking account and sensitively responding to the relevant Conservation 
Area Character Appraisal and Management Strategy; and  
b) Retaining buildings , groups of buildings, historic street patterns  and 
other features, includ ing trees , landscape features and architectural 
details , which make a positive  contribution to the character  or 
appearance  of the Conservation Area;  and 
c) Ensuring the design of all development, within the Conservation Area , 
or within its setting is of high quality which responds appropriately to 
the special architectural, historic character or appearance of the area 
and surrounding buildings in terms of scale, height, layout, design, 
detailing and materials;  and 
d) Protecting open spaces and views , in and out of the area which are  
important to the character and setting of the area;   
 
Proposals which would result in the loss of a building or other structure which 
makes a positive contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area will 
also be consider ed against the criteria set out in policy HE3:  Listed Buildings and 
Structures and/or their Setting s. 
 
Proposals which would cause substantial harm to the significance and character 
of a Conservation Area will not be permitted unless it is  demonstrated tha t the 
harm would be outweighed by substantial public benefits.  
 
Proposals which would cause less than substantial harm to the significance and 
character of the Conservation Area will be considered against the  public benefits 
to be gained.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
12.18 Proposals will be assessed in line with the relevant Conservation Area Character 
Appraisal and in accordance with the NPPF and the Council will give great weight to 
ensuring the preservation or enhancement of the Conservation Area, its setting or any 
features of special architectural or historic interest.  
  
 Listed Buildings and Structures  and/or their Settings  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
12.19 Listed buildings  and other listed structures  are statutorily designated under the Town 
and Country Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The term 
listed  building can cover a wide variety of man -made structures, not just houses but also  
 
300 
 
churches, ind ustrial and agricultural buildings and structures like bridges, walls, statues, 
mileposts, phone boxes and lamp posts. These buildings and structures are nationally 
listed to mark and celebrate special architectural and historic interest. All buildings bui lt 
before 1700 which survive in anything like their original condition are likely to be listed, 
as are most of those built between 1700 and 1850. Buildings from the period after 1945  
are carefully selected , and there is usually a minimum building age of 30  years for it to 
be eligible for listing.  
  
12.20 Listed buildings /structures  are broken down into 3 categories:  
• Grade I buildings: buildings of exceptional interest;  
• Grade II * buildings: particularly important buildings of more than special interest;  
• Grade II  buildings of special interest. This classification is the most common (92% 
of all listed buildings are in this listing class) and it is the most likely grade of listing 
for a homeowner.  
  
12.21 The majority of listed buildings in the Borough are Grade II listed (as of 2020), however 
There are also 4 Grade I listed buildings and 20 Grade II* listed buildings.  
  
 Policy HE3:  Listed Buildings and Structures  and/or their Settings  
 
Where a development would affect a listed building/structure  and/or its setting, 
proposals should preserve or enhance any features of special architectural o r 
historic interest they possess , proposals must demonstrate sufficient 
understanding of and respond to the historic environment  by ensuring that:  
 
a) Proposals to alter or extend listed buildings/structures , are accompanied 
by a Heritage Statement , which provides sufficient detail and is 
proportionate to the proposal and  describes :  
1. the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any 
contribution made by their setting ; and  
2. the principles of the propos al and its impact on the building ; and 
3. why the works proposed are desirable or necessary;  
b) Proposals are of a  well-considered design which ensure that any 
development is appropriate in terms of style, scale, density, height, 
materials,  architectural features and detailing;  and 
c) Changes of use are compatible with and respect the special 
architectural or historic interest of the heritage asset or its setting and;  
d) Demolition of structures within the curtilage of a listed building are  
supported by robust evidence demonstrating that the structure is 
beyond  meaningful use or repair  or is not of special architectural or 
historic  interest as a structure ancillary to the principal listed building.  
 
Great weight will be given to the conservation of listed buildings/structures (the 
more important the asset, the greater the weight will be). Proposals which would 
cause substantial harm to or the total loss of the listed building/structure  will be 
refused  unless it can be demonstrated that  such a proposal would provide  
substantial public benefits which  would  outweigh  the harm caused to the listed 
building/heritage asset .  
  
 
301 
 
Where total or partial loss of a listed building/structure  is to be permitted, the 
Council may require that:  
e) A scheme for the phased development and redevelopment of the site 
providing for its management and treatment in the interim is submitted 
to and approved by the Council. A copy of the signed contract of the 
construction work must be deposited before construct ion commences;  
f) Where practicable, the listed building/structure  is dismantled and rebuilt 
or removed to a site previously approved;  
g) Important features of the listed building/structure  are salvaged and re -
used;  
h) There is an opportunity for the appearance, p lans and particular features 
of the listed building/structure  to be measured and recorded;  
i) Provision is made for archaeological investigation by qualified persons 
and excavation of the site where appropriate.  
 
Proposals which would cause less than substant ial harm to the significance of 
the heritage asset will be considered against the other public benefits to be 
gained. Proposals  will be assessed in accordance with the NPPF and the Council 
will give great weight to  the desirability of preserving the listed  building/structure , 
its setting or any features of special architectural  or historic interest.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
12.22 Works to historic buildings should usually  retain the original structure and fabric as far 
as is possible , because the special interest (its significance) comes from these features, 
in one way or another . Each type of historic building has its own characteristics and 
significance, usually related to its original function and these should be respected when 
proposals for alterations or change of use are put forward , although the Council will take 
a pragmatic approach with regard to optimal viable use . 
  
12.23 A proportionate Heritage Statement will  be required for development proposals that have 
the potential to affect any listed building/structure . The statement should describe the 
significance of the asset, using appropriate references such as the Historic Environment 
Record and should set out the  significance of the asset and the impact of the 
development on the its setting. The statement should demonstrate how the development 
has been designed to better reveal or conserve the heritage asset; failing that, to avoid 
any adverse impact; or if this i s not possible, only then setting out how the impact can 
be minimised or mitigated, and, if there is residual harm, why the public benefits of the 
development outweighs that harm.  Pre-application advice can be sought through 
consultation with the Council’s  Conservation Officer.  
  
12.24 National policy sets out that the weight afforded to heritage assets when  considering 
applications for development should be proportionate to their  importance. This weight 
should be applied when considering  applications for development affecting heritage 
assets in  Fareham and any evidence supporting a proposal  should  be proportionate to 
the importance  of the asset affected . 
  
12.25 In some cases, an alternative use to that proposed may be more appropriate i n the 
interests of securing the long -term conservation of the asset. In accordance with national  
 
302 
 
guidance, weight will be attach ed to the benefits of ensuring the optimal  viable use of 
the heritage asset when making a balanced assessment of such developmen t proposals.  
  
 Archaeology  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
12.26 Archaeological remains constitute the principal surviving evidence of the Borough’s past. 
They are a finite and fragile resource  and t he destruction of such remains, by 
development, should be avoided to ensure the Borough’s past is not lost forever.  
  
12.27 Where development affects archaeological rem ains, these should be preserved in situ,  
and loss or harm to nationally important archaeological remains should be wholly 
exceptional. Where  the public benefit s of the proposed development demonstrably  
outweighs preservation  of the archaeological remains in situ , the Council  will seek to 
secure mitigation through  excavation, recording and public presentation of the results.  
  
12.28  Written consent from the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport must 
be obtained before any work on a Scheduled Ancient Monument can commence139. 
Some developments may also require planning permission.  
  
 Policy HE4: Archaeology  
 
Development which would result in harm to the significance of a Scheduled 
Monument or other nationally important archaeological site140 will not be 
permitted  unless the tests set out in the NPPF are met . 
 
Applications for development on sites where archaeological remains may be 
present must be accompanied by  an initial  desk -based  assessment of the 
archaeological value  in the site . Where t hat initial assessment indicates that 
significant archaeological remains are or may be present, an archaeological field 
evaluation will be required. The evaluation should define:  
 
a) The character, importance and condition of any archaeological deposits 
or structures within the site ; and  
b) The likely impact of the proposed development of these features ; and  
c) The means of mitigating the impact of the proposed development . 
 
Where important archaeological remains are found to exist, and can justifiably be  
left in situ, their protection will be required by planning condition or legal 
agreement.  
 
Where such remains cannot reasonably be protected in situ, a full archaeological 
investigation of the site including archaeological rec ording, formal reporting and 
publication of the findings, and archiving of the recovered material in a suitable 
 
139 Historic England can advise on the process for an application. Visit 
https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/consent/smc/  
140 As set out in NPPF footnote 63   
 
303 
 
repository, will be required in accordance with a scheme of work to be agreed in 
writing with the Council prior to the commencement of any works . 
  
 How this policy works  
  
12.29 Developers are required to provide sufficient information in the  initial assessment  to 
determine  whether there are any remains on site  and the probable effects of the proposal 
on those remains. Consultation of the Historic Environment Record and p re application 
discussions with the Council ’s Conservation Officer or the County Archaeologist  can be 
used to clarify whether applications will requ ire supporting archaeological information.  
  
12.30 Sometimes where archaeological remains are uncovered during development, it is not 
possible to preserve them in situ. In such instances,  with the agreement of the Council, 
or Historic England, as appropriate,  the opportunity should be taken to record these 
archaeological assets, and archive and display them in a local museum where possible. 
It may also often be possible to integrate or ref erence archaeological remains into the 
design when formulating proposals for new development.  
  
 Locally Listed Buildings and Non -Designated Heritage Assets  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
12.31 Non-designated heritage assets in the Borough which include locally listed buildings, 
historic parks and gardens, and heritage structures are valued for their contribution to 
local character  but they do not possess the degree of special interest needed to be added 
to the statutory list of buildings of special architectural or historic Interest. Such buildings , 
structures  or places  of local historic interest have been included on a local list compiled 
by the Council141. Locally listed buildings and other non -designated heritage assets do 
not enjoy the same  legal protection given to those on the national list  however  the Council 
seek s to ensure that development proposals  avoid  harm to their chara cter and setting.  
  
12.32 Occasionally, development proposals affect heritage assets that have not yet been 
identified either nationally or locally as heritage assets, yet they are worthy of such 
identification. Spot -listing can be carried out by Histori c England or the Council, as 
appropriate. If the Council choses to consider a building, monument, site, place, area or 
landscape for spot listing, the significance of the asset will be assessed by the Council 
and a decision made on whether the asset merits  local listing. The outcome of this 
decision will be a material consideration in the application.  
  
 Policy HE5:  Locally Listed Buildings and Non -designated Heritage Assets  
 
Non-designated heritage assets recorded on the Council's list will be protected 
from development that would unacceptably harm their architectural and historic 
interest, and/or setting taking account of their significance.  
 
 
141 A list of assets can be found in the Historic Environment Background Paper  available at: 
www.fareham.gov.uk/planning/publicationplanevidence.as px  
  
 
304 
 
Development proposal s which  would affect the significance of a n on-designated 
heritage asset, including any contribution made by its setting, must include  the 
following, in a manner proportionate to the asset’s significance:  
 
a) A descri ption  and assess ment of  the significance of the asset, including 
its setting, to determine its architectural, historical or archaeological 
interest; and  
b) A description of  the impact of the proposed works on the significance 
and special character of the asset; and  
c) Justification for the works, especially if these would harm the 
significance of the asset or its setting, so that the harm can be weighed 
against public benefits.  
 
Where development would demonstrably harm the significance  and/or setting of 
a non -designated  heritage asset, consent will be refused unless  it can be 
demonstrated that  this harm is  outweighed by public benefits.  
 
The Council will consider whether spot -listing is warranted, as appropriate.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
12.33 The evidence supporting developments affecting a non -designated heritage asset should 
be appropriately detailed and proportionate to the asset’s importance.  The Historic 
Environment Record is a useful source of information for establishing the significance of 
heritage assets.  
  
12.34 Further information regarding locally listed buildings and other non -designated heritage 
assets can be obtained in the Heritage Background Paper and via the Council’s website. 
  
 Heritage at Risk  
  
 Why this policy is needed  
  
12.35 Many heritage assets are at risk of being lost to future generations because of neglect,  
decay or inappropriate development. Emerging threats such as increased flood risk  
because of climate change can pose a threat to heritage assets. Where a heritage asset  
is at risk, the use of sustainably sourced traditional materials when undertaking repairs  
will be encouraged. Restoring a heritage asset will also often present an opportunity to  
undertake sensitive measures to improve insula tion or energy efficiency.  
  
 Policy HE6:  Heritage at Risk  
 
Development affecting heritage assets that are deemed at risk by national heritage 
at risk registers will be supported where the proposals constitute the optimum 
viable  use, consistent with the  conservation of the heritage asset. Where a  
proposed development would conflict with other policies in the Plan, but would  
secure the conservation of a heritage asset, the Council will consider whether  the 
benefits of conservation would outweigh any harm caused from departing  from  
 
305 
 
other policies. The extent of any such enabling development should be no  greater 
than necessary to make the conservation of the heritage asset viable.  
  
 How this policy works  
  
12.36 Under the Council ’s positive strategy, the Council  will take action to ensure  the 
maintenance , retention, repair and continued use of heritage assets and will:  
• Proactively seek solutions for assets at risk through discussions with owners to  
secure the preservation of vulnerable and d eteriorating buildings and other 
heritage assets142 through maintenance and repair, and as a last resort, using its 
statutory powers; and   
• Seek to secure the retention of buildings of architectural or historic interest, with 
regard to the optimum viable use of the asset ; and  
• Provide guidance and advice to owners and developers of historic buildings and 
heritage assets .

13.1  It is essential that the policies in the Local Plan are both deliverable and effective and in 
turn help to deliver the Plan’s Vision and Strategic Priorities. The policies will be vital for 
ensuring that the Council delivers sustainable managed growth in conjunction with 
continued environmental protections within the Borough over the course of the Plan 
period. The Council’s Authority Monitoring Report (AMR) will continue to provide the 
mechanism for reporting on the e ffectiveness of delivering the policy objectives of the 
Local Plan once it is adopted. The AMR will use a range of indicators to assess whether 
the policy objectives are being met and will provide a clear indication on whether a partial 
or full review of t he Plan is required.  
13.2 The AMR currently monitors a range of indicators relating to housing which covers 
housing completions, the existing adopted housing requirement, five -year housing land 
supply, projected long term housing trajectory and affordable housing provision. 
Employment and retail floorspace is currently monitored in terms of completions,
