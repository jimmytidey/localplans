Page 1ContentsSunderland is undergoing huge change, building on our 
great history of enterprise and endeavor to become a modern and prosperous 21st century city.  
Through the ambition, intelligence and drive of our 
people, we are creating an exciting vision of how the city could look in future years. This vision is focused on securing Sunderland’s long-term economic future, encouraging inward investment and new employment opportunities by building on our strengths and ensuring the right infrastructure is in place.  
By targeting our investment and the delivery of large-
scale capital projects, we strongly believe we can create the conditions needed to support the development of a city with a reputation for vibrancy and creativity that matches and complements our success as a manufacturing and business hub. 
Ensuring that the city has robust, effective and up-to-
date planning policies that continue to adapt and embrace changing circumstances will be key to our long term ambition. Sunderland’s Plan sets out a framework for this, capturing a clear understanding of how our city’s land and property assets need to be developed to meet the opportunities and challenges facing our city over the coming years to 2033.

Introduction1.1 Planning affects us all. The homes we live in, 
the places we work, the greenspaces where we relax and the roads we travel on, are all a result of planning decisions that have been made. All Local Planning Authorities have a statutory duty to prepare a Local Plan. The Sunderland Local Plan will seek to continue the transformation of Sunderland, by ensuring that we have a framework to develop and protect the city’s land and property assets.  
1.2 This policy framework guides and shapes 
development in Sunderland for the next 18 years and sets the parameters for growth. It ensures that Sunderland is a city that is open for business; providing jobs and economic growth; delivering housing to meet community needs and aspirations; assisting in the tackling of health inequalities and deprivation and protects the city’s important natural and historic environmental assets.  
1.3 The Local Plan is the starting point for the 
determination of planning applications. It sets a clear strategy for bringing land forward to address objectively assessed needs in line  with the presumption in favour of sustainable development. It includes broad locations,  land use designations and allocations to  deliver this strategy. 
1.4 The Local Plan is an important tool to give 
certainty and transparency to residents and businesses as to how the city will develop by 2033. It will enable the city to attract more funding and investment. The purpose of the Local Plan is to create a sustainable, attractive, healthy and prosperous Sunderland where people choose to live and work.  
Figure 1: Administrative Boundary of Sunderland 
Sunderland’s Local Plan 
1.5 Sunderland’s Local Plan is in three parts: 
Part One – Core Strategy and 
Development Plan  (hereafter referred to as 
This Plan); This Plan sets an overarching strategy, strategic policies and strategic allocations and designations for the future change and growth of Sunderland. This Plan also includes local policies for development management purposes. This Plan covers the period from 2015 to 2033 and covers all land within Sunderland’s administrative boundary (Figure 1). 
Part Two – Allocations and Designations Plan
 (hereafter referred to as the A&D Plan); 
will set out local policies including site-speciﬁc policy designations and allocations for the development, protection and conservation of land in the city in order to deliver the overall strategy set out within this Plan. The A&D Plan will cover all land within Sunderland’s administrative boundary.
Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 131. IntroductionPart Three – International Advanced 
Manufacturing Park (IAMP) Area Action Plan (AAP) 2017-2032
 (hereafter referred to 
as the IAMP AAP); was adopted by Sunderland City Council and South Tyneside Council in November 2017. This part of the Local Plan sets out site speciﬁc policies for the comprehensive development of the IAMP.  
1.6 This Plan and the IAMP AAP have superseded 
saved policies of the Sunderland Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 1998 and UDP Alteration No. 2 (2007). However, a number of policies will remain as saved policies and part of the Development Plan until such time as the A&D Plan is adopted. These saved policies will continue to be applied and be a consideration in the determination of planning applications, until they are replaced by policies in the A&D Plan. Appendix 1 sets out the saved policies which should be read alongside this Plan. 
1.7 All policies in the Local Plan will be monitored 
regularly and reviewed (in accordance with the Monitoring Framework) and updated if necessary, to ensure that the Plan is up-to-date. The council’s Local Development Scheme provides details of timescales for preparing and reviewing the Local Plan. The Local Plan may also be supplemented by Neighbourhood Plans, Area Action Plans, Housing Delivery Plans and Supplementary Planning Documents where appropriate. 
1.8 The council has a number of SPDs in place 
which provide more detail in relation to speciﬁc policies. It is anticipated that these will be updated where necessary to reﬂect the policies of this Plan. A number of draft SPDs are also in place which provide more detail for speciﬁc policies within this Plan and the intention is to adopt these following adoption of this Plan. The council also has proposals  for a number of new SPDs which will expand upon policies of this Plan and will be prepared in due course. The programme for the preparation of SPDs is included within the council’s Local Development Scheme. Upon adoption of the this Plan a number of SPDs have been deleted.Preparing the Plan 
1.9 The Core Strategy and Development Plan 
Compliance Statement sets out how the council has positively prepared the Plan in accordance with legislation, regulations and national policy. It also includes justiﬁcation how this Plan has met the legal and regulatory requirements and meets the test of soundness. This document should be read alongside the Plan. 
Structure of this Plan 
1.10 This Plan comprises of four sections: 
Setting the scene  
This section sets out the background to the preparation of this Plan and provides the context to the type of place that Sunderland is today, the challenges it faces and the opportunities for the future. 
Vision, strategic priorities and spatial strategy 
This section sets out our vision and strategic priorities for Sunderland by 2033. It outlines the spatial strategy for how and where the future growth of Sunderland will be delivered and contains strategic allocations which are fundamental to the delivery of the Plan. 
Strategic and local policies 
This section includes chapters that will guide and manage development covering a range of themes including; Healthy and Safe Communities; Homes; Economic Growth; Vitality of Centres; Built and Historic Environment; Natural Environment; Water, Waste and Energy; Sustainable Transport; and Minerals.  
This Plan includes different types of policies “SP” policies 
are strategic policies, “SS” are strategic site allocations and all other policies are considered to be local. 
Implementation 
This section sets out how the policies in the Plan will be implemented including Infrastructure and Delivery. The Monitoring Framework set out in Appendix 8 details how the policies will be monitored.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 142.1 This planning framework for the future 
development of Sunderland is based on a comprehensive understanding of the area as it is now, the challenges that need to be addressed and the opportunities that exist. This chapter is an executive summary of the evidence (Appendix 2) that has been prepared to support this Plan. It summarises the key features and characteristics of Sunderland today and highlights some of the challenges and opportunities the city may face by 2033.  
Sunderland 
2.2 Sunderland is located within the North East of 
England and is bounded by: County Durham to the south and west; Gateshead to the north west; South Tyneside to the north; and the North Sea to the east. The administrative boundary covers 53 square miles. 
 
Figure 2: Location of Sunderland 
2.3 Sunderland displays a polycentric 
development pattern - one which does not focus on a single centre, but on many  centres. The urban areas are surrounded by greenﬁeld land, which make up more than 50% of the city area and creating a green  and attractive city. 2.4 Underdeveloped greenﬁeld land which runs 
along the northern edge of the administrative boundary of Sunderland is part of the Tyne and Wear Green Belt. This also surrounds Washington, separating it from Sunderland to the east, Gateshead to the north west and Durham to the south west. The Green Belt also extends to the south and west of the city, separating Sunderland with Houghton-le-Spring and Seaham.  
2.5 To the south of Warden Law and the  
B1404 and within the smaller settlements within the Coalﬁeld area there is Open Countryside. Settlement Break designations exist between the built up areas of the Coalﬁeld and South Sunderland. 
Spatial areas  
2.6 Sunderland is spatially recognised by ﬁve 
unique sub areas. Each of these sub-areas are distinct, consequently, the nature of Sunderland’s development requires spatial planning that reﬂects its diversity of place.
Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 172. Sunderland todayThe Urban Core  
 
Figure 3: The Urban Core 
2.7 The Urban Core is the main administrative 
centre of the city and includes wide diversity such as the city centre, both campuses of the University of Sunderland and a number of key leisure and tourism facilities, including the Stadium of Light, the Empire Theatre, the Aquatics Centre and the Beacon of Light. The Urban Core is a heavily urbanised area close to the mouth of the River Wear covering an area of approximately 180 hectares.  
2.8 The Urban Core is a highly accessible location 
with a transport interchange located at Park Lane providing access to a range of bus  routes and metro services to Gateshead, Newcastle and Newcastle Airport. The Urban Core also contains Sunderland Station which provides rail connections to Newcastle, Carlisle and Teesside, in addition to Grand Central Services which provide connectivity to York and London. 
2.9 Due to its wide diversity of uses, the Urban 
Core contains a relatively modest population base of approximately 3,200 residents.Washington 
 
Figure 4: Washington 
2.10 Washington is a highly sustainable location, 
with excellent transport links to the city centre, Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle and signiﬁcant job opportunities at the IAMP, Follingsby Park and within Washington.  
2.11 Washington is a planned New Town with a 
population of circa 65,000 people. It accommodates a main town centre at  The Galleries, a district centre at Concord and  a series of smaller village centres. It is a principal location for jobs and continues to have the strongest employment market within the city. Washington is also typiﬁed by having large amounts of greenspace, parkland and tree cover. 
2.12 Washington has an estimated 25,000 dwellings 
which equates to nearly 20% of the housing stock in Sunderland. The development of additional homes in this area has been constrained by Green Belt on all sides as well as the lack of available urban sites for development. During the period 2007 to 2015, only 652 homes or 93 homes per annum were built in the Washington area. The latest Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) identiﬁes land available to accommodate only 951 homes on 13 sites during the plan period. This equates to 9% of the total land supply in Sunderland.
Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 18South Sunderland  
 
Figure 5: South Sunderland 
2.13 The South Sunderland sub-area covers an area 
of 4,284 hectares and is the most populated sub-area of the city, with a population of 116,000. It is bounded by Green Belt to the south and west, coastline to the east and the River Wear to the north. 
2.14 Although South Sunderland is oriented 
towards the city centre, the sub-area is also served by a number of district and local centres. It incorporates the Port of Sunderland and Doxford International as well as other key employment centres along the riverside, A19 and towards the coast. 
2.15 South Sunderland is a popular residential area. 
The area contains the largest proportion of the city’s housing stock and contains 43% of all deliverable and developable housing sites within the SHLAA, including the South Sunderland Growth Area (SSGA), which will constitute the largest urban extension in the city over the plan period. 
2.16 Despite being the most densely developed 
sub-area, the area contains a range of built and natural features which add to its character. The area has a distinct urban history and rich architectural heritage.North Sunderland  
 
Figure 6: North Sunderland 
2.17 The Sunderland North sub-area is highly 
urbanised with just over 55,100 residents and limited opportunities for development. It is bounded by Green Belt to the north, coastline to the east, the A19 to the west and River Wear to the south. 
2.18 Like South Sunderland, the sub-area is also 
oriented towards the city centre but it is also served by strong district centres at Southwick, Sea Road and Monkwearmouth, together with local centres further west. It incorporates a number of primary and key employment areas along the riverside/A1231 corridor and A19. 
2.19 In recent years, housing regeneration has 
taken place that has delivered an increased choice of tenure and an improved quality and mix of homes. The highly developed nature of the sub-area means that new residential development opportunities will remain limited, but further urban regeneration will take place. 
2.20 Greenspace in North Sunderland is limited in 
places, but further improvements will take place to further enhance the quality and accessibility of parkland, riverside and coast. 
Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 19The Coalﬁeld 
 
Figure 7: The Coalﬁeld 
2.21 The Coalﬁeld is the largest of the sub-areas in 
the city by area, covering over 5,500 hectares, approximately 42% of the city. It is made up of a number of former mining towns and villages that include Houghton-le-Spring and Hetton-le-Hole. It is the least densely populated of the sub-areas with some 46,000 residents (17% of the city’s population). It is bounded by Green Belt to the north, west and east, with open countryside surrounding the south, which extends into County Durham. 
2.22 Houghton-le-Spring Town Centre serves as the 
principal centre in the Coalﬁeld, with separate centres in Hetton-le-Hole to the south and Shiney Row to the north. 
2.23 The principal employment area in the Coalﬁeld 
is Rainton Bridge Industrial Estate and the area is also served by 4 smaller key employment areas. A key issue for Coalﬁeld residents is the need for improved public transport connections to employment opportunities elsewhere in the city.2.24 The Coalﬁeld has been the focus for new 
housing and housing regeneration over the past 20 years and will remain so within the plan period. However, supporting infrastructure is being increasingly impacted upon and will need signiﬁcant investment. 
2.25 Although some greenﬁeld land has been lost 
to development in recent years, the sub-area retains some of the highest levels of greenspace in the city. This has been increased in recent decades by reclamation of former industrial land and the creation of high quality country parks. 
Population of Sunderland  
2.26 It is estimated that Sunderland has a 
population of 277,9621 (as shown in Figure 8). 
Following decades of population decline, population is growing and it is expected to continue to grow over the plan period. 
 
Figure 8: Population change within Sunderland 
2.27 Our population is also changing. Over recent 
decades Sunderland has experienced a trend of net out- migration to surrounding neighbouring authorities and other parts of the UK. Between 2002 and 2012 the net out-migration from the city averaged -1,119 people per annum. This has been particularly pronounced within the younger age cohorts of the working age population. 
2.28 However, more recent evidence demonstrates 
that this trend is changing and the net  out-migration has been reducing signiﬁcantly averaging -625 over the 5 year period  (2011-2016). 
2.29 Projections also estimate that the population 
of Sunderland is ageing. Population projections estimate that the number of people aged 65

YearPopulationCore Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 20or over will increase by 36.8% by 2033. The 
ageing population of the city, combined with a net out-migration of residents, has led to a reduction in the number of working age residents living within the city. ONS Mid-Year Population Estimates show that, between 2000 and 2012, the size of the working age population in the city declined by 2.7%. Without intervention the working age population would likely shrink further. This means that commuting rates to the city would likely need to increase to support jobs growth in Sunderland.  
 
Figure 9: Job growth and working age population change  
(2000-2012)2 
2.30 Ethnic diversity in the city is relatively low,  
with 95.8% of the city’s population describing themselves as ‘White British’
3. The largest 
minority groups within the city are  ‘Asian/Asian British’ and ‘White Other’ with 1.8% and 1.1% of the population respectively describing themselves as falling within these ethnic groups. 
2.31 The proportion of the Sunderland population 
with higher level qualiﬁcations (NVQ4 or above) is just 27.3%, which is lower than both the regional and national ﬁgures
4. Despite this, 
the proportion of the population with higher level qualiﬁcations has increased signiﬁcantly in Sunderland in recent years. The proportion of the population with no qualiﬁcations has also reduced noticeably and now stands at just 8.6%, which is lower than the regional average. Healthy safe communities 
2.32 Residents of Sunderland generally experience 
a higher level of social and economic disadvantage than the England average and there is a strong link between high levels of socio-economic disadvantage and poor health. The 2015 Indices of Deprivation ranked Sunderland as the 37th most deprived local authority out of the 326 local authority areas  in England. Whilst the average life expectancy at birth has improved, Sunderland continues  to lag behind and residents live, on average, shorter lives than the England average
5. They 
also live, on average, a greater part of their  lives with illness or disability which limits their daily activities. 
2.33 Unhealthy lifestyles remain a key cause for our 
increased rates of premature death. Many people in Sunderland continue to follow unhealthy lifestyle behaviours when compared with England as a whole
6. This is directly linked 
to a range of social, economic and environmental factors. Childhood obesity rates within the city are higher than the national average with 24% of Year 6 children being classiﬁed as obese when compared to the national average of 19.8%
7. 
2.34 We have a relatively high number of hot food 
takeaways, with 17 of the 25 wards within the city having a higher concentration of hot food takeaways per head of population than the national average
8. 
Homes  
2.35 Housing plays a fundamental role in 
supporting the health and wellbeing of its residents and it is vital to ensure more  housing choice is available to support the needs of our residents.  
2.36 We currently have approximately 126,000 
dwellings, with the vast majority of these being houses (76.7%)
9. The remaining housing stock 
comprises of 12.1% ﬂats and maisonettes,

2.37 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment 
Update (SHMA) indicates that the median house price within the city was just £107,000 based on Land Registry data from 2014, making the city the second lowest authority in terms of house prices within the North East of England (Figure 10). Sunderland has a disproportionate supply of lower Council Tax banded properties, with over 61% of dwellings falling within Council Tax band A (Figure 11). 
 
Figure 10: Median house prices 
 
Figure 11: Sunderland Council Tax 
2.38 The vast majority of dwellings are 2 and 3 
bedroom properties (76%), which is a notably higher proportion when compared to other areas. As identiﬁed in the SHMA, there is a shortage of 3 and 4 bedroom houses to meet families’ needs, bungalows and other accommodation to meet older person’s needs.2.39 Within the city there are a number of empty 
properties, whilst most of these are short term in nature, there is a relatively small number of long-term empty properties (over 6 months), approximately 2% of the city’s housing stock. The council continues to assist in bringing empty properties back into use. 
2.40 There continues to be a demand for affordable 
housing units across the city. Particularly with the impact of welfare reform where there is an increased demand from young people, families, vulnerable people and older people. The SHMA identiﬁes an imbalance of 542 affordable units (both for affordable rent and affordable home ownership) per annum over the next 5 years. 
2.41 There are some neighbourhoods that are not 
as prosperous as others, have a lack of good quality housing, poor physical environments and have higher levels of crime and anti-social behaviour. There are some places in the city already showing symptoms of housing decline and anti-social behaviour: these are most prevalent in parts of Hendon, Sulgrave, Millﬁeld, Pallion, Eden Vale, Silksworth, Hetton Downs and other pockets of the Coalﬁeld area
10. 
2.42 The city has a resident student population, due 
to the presence of the University of Sunderland, which is spread across two campuses. The University of Sunderland has over 9,000 full-time students enrolled
11. 
2.43 Student numbers may rise over the plan 
period due to demographic shift and the University’s intention to target students in its key growth areas and those of the region, namely health sciences and wellbeing, advanced manufacturing, engineering and computing software and big data.  
2.44 The expectations of some students for better 
quality, self-contained accommodation has seen an increase in new, purpose-built student accommodation within the city over recent years. It is recognised however, that there is not always a linear relationship between increasing student numbers and demand for student residential accommodation, given the local demographic of students attending the University of Sunderland.

Page 222.45 Sunderland has an established community of 
Travelling Showpeople with a total of 100 plots on four sites, mainly within the Coalﬁeld area  (1 small site in Washington). 
2.46 The city does encounter unauthorised 
encampments by Gypsies and Travellers, however these are small and temporary in nature with Gypsies and Travellers passing through the city and not wanting to live  here permanently.  
2.47 In terms of delivering new homes, Sunderland 
has recently experienced higher delivery  than a decade ago as illustrated in Figure 12. This is in part due to the amount of demolitions between 2000 and 2013 and the recession. However, this trend during the past ﬁve years has started to change, with an average net additional dwellings completion  of 817 per year.  
 
Figure 12: Housing delivery 
2.48 Historically, we have been very successful at 
developing previously developed land. In fact, between 1995 and 2019, 82% of new housing development in Sunderland was built on previously developed land (PDL) (brownﬁeld) (see Figure 13).  
Figure 13: Proportion of housing completions on previously 
developed land 
2.49 The council’s latest SHLAA identiﬁes only 41% 
of new homes will be delivered on brownﬁeld land. This is because the supply of brownﬁeld sites that is considered to be deliverable is considered to be relatively low. This is in part due to viability. The council’s Viability Assessment concluded that Sunderland has challenging areas and previously developed land will be difﬁcult to deliver and therefore sites in the Urban Core should not be heavily relied upon in the housing supply.  
2.50 The spatial distribution of housing supply in 
recent years varies across the city. For example, between 2008 and 2019, 34% of housing completions in the city were in the Coalﬁeld, sub-area compared to 14% in the Washington sub-area. Consequently, the Coalﬁeld settlements have become particularly saturated with housing development and increasingly, infrastructure including the road network and school capacity has been put under pressure. On the other hand, other parts of city such as Washington and Sunderland North have experienced lower levels of housing growth, in part, due to the lack of available sites for development and these areas being tightly surrounded by Green Belt. 1,000

Economic growth  
2.52 We have a strong track record of attracting 
investment and growth directly into the city, as well as beneﬁtting from being ideally placed in terms of the wider regional economy.  
2.53 Experian data suggests that there were 
130,150 workforce jobs registered in Q1 of 2015, representing an increase of 9,630 jobs (8%) compared to 1997. Despite this, unemployment within the city remains at 6.3%, compared to the regional average of 6.2% and the national average of 4.4%. 
12  
Figure 14: Workforce jobs  
2.54 Key sectors that have experienced strong 
employment growth over the last 15 years include health & care, utilities, food & ﬁnance, accommodation and insurance & pensions. The business base accommodates a slightly lower share of smaller ﬁrms and a higher share of larger ﬁrms compared with regional and national averages. It is also characterised by relatively low levels of business start-ups and self-employment. 
2.55 Advanced manufacturing and particularly the 
automotive sector are a key part of the local economy, centred around the Nissan plant, which produces more than 500,000 vehicles a year and supports a thriving supply chain extending along the A19 and A1 corridors. The sector employs 30,000 people regionally. To support the continued growth of this sector, the IAMP will be developed on land to the north of the existing Nissan plant. It is anticipated that the IAMP would create approximately 7,850 new jobs and would be a signiﬁcant driver for the regional economy and the automotive sector within the UK.  
2.56 Workplace wages also exceed resident wages, 
indicating that the types of jobs available locally are well paid, however many of these are ﬁlled by workers who live outside of the administrative boundaries of Sunderland. As a result, Sunderland is a net importer of labour, with a net inﬂow in the order of 5,670 workers each day 
13. Over the last ten years, the city’s 
self-containment rate has reduced by 3%, as a

working age population. Census data also points to a slight skills mismatch, with in-commuters more likely to be employed within higher skilled occupations. 
2.57 We have a wide range of existing industrial 
estates and business parks. The employment land requirements for the period 2015 to  2033 have been calculated to be between 95ha to 115ha. There are signiﬁcant variations in supply within the different sub-areas (as shown in Table 2). Washington continues  to experience the strongest demand for industrial development. 
 
Table 2: Supply of available employment land14 
2.58 Ofﬁce development historically has been 
focussed within the Urban Core and town centres. However, over recent decades there has been a signiﬁcant shift in the location of ofﬁces, with more choosing to locate to out-of-centre facilities on purpose-built business parks. This trend has been particularly pronounced within Sunderland, with the creation of new business parks at Doxford International, Hylton Riverside and Rainton Bridge. Business parks have been the primary focus for ofﬁce development over the past couple of decades. 
2.59 There are three main centres in Sunderland. 
The Urban Core (which contains the city centre retail boundary) is the main location for shopping with 99,990sqm
15 of ﬂoorspace. 
Washington Centre contains 58,000sqm16 of ﬂoorspace and has a wide range of shops and 
facilities, including a leisure centre, two large supermarkets and a number of national multiple retailers. While Houghton Town Centre is much smaller in scale, it remains the main centre within the Coalﬁeld area and includes a number of shops and services including a library, sports centre and health centre. There are also a number of other district and local centres throughout the city, which are important in meeting the day-to-day needs of their local residents. 
2.60 The amount of market share and revenue of 
the city centre has declined over recent years. The council’s Retail Needs Assessment (2016) indicates that the comparison retail revenue of the city centre has declined from £335m in 2008 to £272m by 2016, which represents a 19% fall. This is a national trend and partly due to changing shopping habits, such as the growth of out-of-centre retail and online retailing, but also due to increased competition between centres. 
2.61 The number and concentration of hot food 
takeaways within the city is becoming an increasing concern, not only in relation to health, but also due to the adverse impact that an over concentration of such uses can have on the vitality and viability of designated centres, whilst also changing the overall retail character of designated centres and reducing the diversity of uses. Many hot food takeaways are only open during evening hours resulting in inactive frontages during normal daytime trading hours, which can have an adverse impact on the vitality and general attractiveness of shopping centres. 
2.62 Sunderland’s cultural and leisure offer is 
extensive and varied, including two high quality beach resorts, accessible open spaces, leisure centres, a dry ski slope, the only 50m Olympic-sized swimming pool in the North East, Sunderland AFC football stadium, the Empire Theatre, a cinema, plus many music venues, restaurants and bars. In addition, Sunderland plays host to a number of events throughout the year including the annual International  Air Show.

Page 25Built and historic environment  
2.63 Sunderland contains a wide range of heritage 
assets, including nine Scheduled Ancient Monuments and 692 listed buildings. Sunderland has a strong historical heritage with iconic structures within the city, such as Fulwell Mill, Hylton Castle, Penshaw Monument and St Peter’s Church, together with quality townscapes, including 14 conservation areas that are protected throughout the city. 
2.64 There are 9 Scheduled Ancient Monuments or 
Grade I and II* Listed Buildings and 2 conservation areas on Historic England’s At-Risk Register in 2015. These include the Old Sunderland and Old Sunderland Riverside Conservation Areas, Bowes Railway Museum, Hylton Castle, Doxford House and Monkwearmouth Station Museum. In addition, there are numerous Grade II Listed Buildings and non-designated heritage assets across the city, the condition and vacancy of which also places them at risk. 
Natural environment 
2.65 The natural environment is one of our greatest 
assets and includes a network of identiﬁed wildlife and geological sites as well as priority species and habitats which in turn contributes to our economy, our health and wellbeing whilst enriching our lives. Designated sites in the city comprise: 
                
•International – 1 Special Area of 
Conservation (SAC), 1 Special Protection Area (SPA) and 1 RAMSAR; 
                
•National – 17 Sites of Special Scientiﬁc 
Interest, 5 Local Nature Reserves; and 
                •Local – 6 Local Geological Sites, 63  
Local Wildlife Sites and 14 proposed Local Wildlife Sites. 
2.66 Our natural environment is highly diverse, 
offering coastal, riverside and limestone landscapes, interspersed with a rich heritage. There are two National Character Area classiﬁcations; namely the Tyne and Wear Lowlands and the Durham Magnesian Limestone Plateau. Due to the Magnesian Limestone geology of the city and association with the North Sea coast and River Wear estuary, Sunderland has many sites of botanical interest and a variety of habitats of value to wildlife.  2.67 Whilst Sunderland forms part of the Tyne and 
Wear conurbation, it beneﬁts from wide green infrastructure corridors to the north, west and south of the main built-up area, as well as Open Countryside to the west and east of Houghton and Hetton and a green corridor along the River Wear that runs through the heart of the city. There are more than 3,800 hectares of formal and natural greenspace, including 42 parks. Approximately half of the city’s residents can reach a quality natural greenspace within 300m of their homes. 
Waste, water and energy  
2.68 The main rivers in the city are the River Wear, 
which ﬂows north-eastwards to the sea at Sunderland, the River Don which ﬂows along the northern council boundary and the Lumley Park Burn/Hetton Burn, which is a westward draining tributary of the Wear. The topography of the area is characterised by the River Wear valley in the north and east of the city.  
2.69 There are 5 Critical Drainage Areas identiﬁed 
within the city, which are areas that the Environment Agency (EA) has identiﬁed as having notable ﬂood risk and drainage problems. In these locations, there is a need for surface water to be managed to a higher standard than normal to ensure that any new development will contribute to a reduction in the risk of ﬂooding. These higher standards are determined by the Environment Agency. 
2.70 The city’s drinking supply emanates from a 
combination of reservoirs, treatment works and boreholes, including the Magnesian Limestone aquifer, which lies beneath the eastern part of the city and is protected through source protection zones. 
2.71 Sunderland is well served by waste 
infrastructure and is net self-sufﬁcient in the management of waste. The area has signiﬁcant built waste management capacity which provides for the needs of Sunderland and a number of other authorities across the North East region. 
2.72 Local authority waste is managed under the 
South Tyne and Wear Waste Management Partnership (STWWMP) which is a collaboration between Sunderland, Gateshead and South Tyneside Councils and covers the management of this waste for the duration of the plan period. Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 26Sustainable transport  
2.73 Sunderland beneﬁts from good public 
transport infrastructure, with a comprehensive network of bus routes, whilst the Tyne and Wear Metro provides frequent services connecting to destinations throughout Tyne and Wear. In terms of rail access, Sunderland has a train station providing frequent links (up to eight trains an hour including both Northern Rail and Metro services) to Newcastle Central Station, from where East Coast Mainline services can be accessed. Grand Central provides a direct rail service (ﬁve times a day) to York and London from Sunderland Station. 
2.74 Key road connections include: 
                • The A19 – a key strategic route connecting 
to North Tyneside, Northumberland and the A1 in the north and to Teesside and North Yorkshire in the south; 
                • The A183 – running east to west and 
connecting Sunderland to Chester-le-Street and the A1; 
                • The A1018 – running south from the 
Urban Core to Seaham and the A19; 
                • The A182 – running south and south-east 
from Washington to Houghton-le-Spring, County Durham and the A19; 
                • The A690 – running north east to south 
west and connecting Sunderland to Durham and the A1; and 
                • The A1231 – running east to west and 
connecting Sunderland to the A1 and  the A19. 
2.75 Recent improvement schemes have been 
implemented at key junctions along the A19 to improve connectivity and the council is bringing forward the Sunderland Strategic Transport Corridor, which will improve connectivity to the sites along the southern edge of the River Wear, the city centre and  the Port. Improvements are also proposed  at the Downhill junction to support the proposed IAMP. 
2.76 The majority of journeys within Sunderland 
continue to be made by private car, however bus and metro patronage is strong and growing. Bus travel is the most commonly used form of public transport, representing approximately 75% of journeys made by public transport. This reﬂects the lack of rail and 
metro services in most of the city. There are over 150km of dedicated cycle routes in Sunderland, with more than 80km off-road. There are also three routes on the National Cycle Network which pass through the city; with sections of National Cycle Routes 1, 7  and 70. 
Minerals  
2.77 Sunderland possesses a variety of valuable 
mineral resources which play a part in meeting local, regional and national requirements. Sunderland currently has one operational quarry at Eppleton Quarry, Hetton-le-Hole, which is extracting Permian yellow sand and Magnesian Limestone. The limestone is crushed before sale for use as roadstone and ﬁll. Magnesian Limestone from the area is also used for agricultural purposes. There are also surface coal resources present across roughly the western half of Sunderland, although coal is no longer extracted.  
2.78 Sunderland is reliant on imports of minerals 
from authorities within the North East and further aﬁeld. The need for aggregates for built development is addressed through the Local Aggregate Assessment which is prepared jointly with the 8 North East Mineral Planning Authorities (MPAs). The Local Aggregates Assessment (LAA) has identiﬁed that the Tyne and Wear authorities jointly do not provide sufﬁcient minerals to meet their needs, and resources will be depleted during the plan period. Sunderland is the main contributor to the supply of aggregates in Tyne and Wear and an extension to Eppleton Quarry will assist in meeting future needs.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 27Vision, strategic 
priorities and  spatial strategy 3.1 To enable Sunderland to take hold of the 
opportunities available to it and address the strategic challenges outlined in the previous chapter, this Plan sets out a spatial vision for Sunderland by 2033. This vision describes where the city wants to be by 2033 and has been inﬂuenced by a number of other council plans and strategies and their visions including:

to deliver sustainable development to secure  a better quality of life for everyone now and  for future generations. All the policies within this Plan contribute towards achieving sustainable development. 
4.2 Sustainable development is considered to be 
the golden thread running through this Plan. For the purposes of this Plan, the deﬁnition of sustainable development is contained in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The NPPF emphasises the economic, social and environmental roles which the planning system must perform in order that sustainable development can be delivered. The three roles cannot be undertaken in isolation as they are mutually dependent and this Plan will seek to ensure that these roles are sought jointly and concurrently wherever possible. This Plan will positively seek opportunities to meet the development needs of Sunderland unless the adverse impacts of doing so would signiﬁcantly and demonstrably outweigh the beneﬁts. 
4.3 This Plan seeks to provide a ﬂexible policy 
framework to remove obstacles where appropriate and encourage sustainable development. The Plan should be read as whole and all policies taken into consideration if relevant.  
4.4 Climate change is recognised as one of the 
most signiﬁcant threats facing the 21st Century and as such, there are unprecedented challenges to the environment, economy and the future security of energy. Sunderland Partnership and the council recognise that climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges and the Climate Change Action Plan sets out how the city is going to reduce its energy consumption, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases, which are known to be the main cause of climate change. The spatial strategy and all policies in the Plan will seek to reduce the impacts of climate change.  
4.5 This spatial strategy chapter sets out policies 
for the overall strategy for development, growth and investment in Sunderland to 2033. It also contains policies for each of the spatial sub- areas, for strategic allocations and it 
identiﬁes locations where development should take place in order to create sustainable neighbourhoods and deliver our vision and objectives. This strategy is based on a number of considerations: 
                • national planning policy;                  • this Plan’s Strategic Priorities and Vision;                  • our environmental constraints; and                  • the availability and viability of land for 
development.

i. deliver at least 13,410 net new homes 
and create sustainable mixed communities which are supported by adequate infrastructure;  
ii. create at least 7,200 new jobs, particularly 
in key growth sectors; 
iii. develop at least 95ha of employment 
land;  
iv. deliver at least 45,400m² new comparison 
retail development; and 
v. ensure that sufﬁcient physical, social and 
environment infrastructure is delivered to meet identiﬁed needs.  
2. The spatial strategy seeks to deliver this growth 
and sustainable patterns of development by: Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 354. Spatial strategy 
4.8 In order to meet identiﬁed development 
needs, the development strategy sets out the scale and distribution of new development for the plan period up to 2033. 
4.9 Through the spatial strategy, the Plan seeks to 
enable sustainable economic growth. By 2033, it is the aim of the strategy to ensure that the city offers the right type of new homes in the right places and creates opportunities for job growth. The strategy seeks to align economic growth in the city with the housing offer, to ensure that past trends of out-migration are rebalanced. This will ensure the sustainability of our area in the future as a place to both live and work.  
4.10 As required by the NPPF, this Plan must deﬁne 
the overall level of growth over the plan period (2015 to 2033), based on the requirement to meet the city’s objectively assessed needs (OAN). Determining the OAN for housing has been assisted by the SHMA
17. The SHMA has identiﬁed the OAN for housing in Sunderland 
to be an average of 745 net additional dwellings per annum (dpa) each year, equating to a total housing requirement of at least 13,410 net additional dwellings over the plan period. The 13,410 net dwellings ﬁgure should not be seen as a ceiling, but rather the level of growth which is both needed and anticipated to take place over the plan period.  
4.11 In accordance with Planning Practice Guidance 
(PPG) paragraph 2a-018, the OAN includes an economic uplift. When calculating an authority’s OAN, the local planning authority should consider and assess the likely change in the number of jobs over the plan period based on an economic forecast. The Experian jobs growth forecast, which was utilised for the demographic modelling work within this Plan, assumes a total of 7,200 net additional workforce jobs being created in Sunderland over the plan period. This economic forecast is considered to be realistic as over the past 18 years (1997-2015) 9,630 new jobs have been created in Sunderland
18. 
4.12 Within this jobs forecast, 3,400 of the predicted 
jobs growth is anticipated to be within the Transport Equipment and Machinery & Equipment sectors, which are the employment sectors that are most likely to be represented on the IAMP. It is therefore anticipated that the majority of the forecast growth in these sectors will take place on the IAMP. Given the priority and support to the IAMP, we are conﬁdent that the projected job growth will  be delivered.  
4.13 The IAMP is an important driver for economic 
growth and this will have a consequential impact on the demand for new housing in the northern part of the city. The evidence associated with the IAMP AAP establishes a very clear link between the development of the IAMP and the need for additional housing to support the anticipated workforce, in particular a need for more larger family homes. The background reports to the IAMP AAP suggest that there is a particular need to increase the proportion of detached 4-bedroom and semi-detached 3-bedroom properties to reﬂect the proﬁle of dwellings required to support the anticipated inﬂux of workers. The council considers that the

vii. minimising and mitigating the likely 
effects of climate change.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 36economic uplift applied as part of the 
calculation of the OAN, already accounts for growth associated with the IAMP. Notwithstanding this, under its duty-to-cooperate, the council will work with neighbouring authorities to undertake additional work to further consider the impacts of the IAMP in the future once there is more certainty over the speed of delivery and its likely impacts. 
4.14 The Government’s standardised methodology 
calculates a Local Housing Need (LHN) for Sunderland of 573 dpa. The SHMA Addendum (2018) and Compliance Statement, demonstrate that pursuing a housing target based purely on the Government’s household growth projections would mean that the Plan would provide an insufﬁcient number of dwellings to support economic growth within in the city. It is considered that such a low level of development would have severe consequences including:  
                • demand for new housing outstripping 
supply potentially leading to young people being unable to stay in the area; 
                • economic growth being constrained (due 
to a shortage of local labour force); or 
                • increased levels of in-commuting to 
support economic growth, which would not be sustainable and would put greater strain on the transport network.  
4.15 The housing requirement within this Plan has 
therefore been set at a level that supports the economic growth aspirations established by Experian and to meet housing needs. 
4.16 To assist delivery in the supply of housing sites 
and to ensure deliverability, the council has identiﬁed sufﬁcient supply (above the OAN) to act as a ﬂexibility factor. This allows for an additional supply of housing sites to be maintained throughout the plan period, in case the delivery of some sites fails to materialise within the anticipated timescales. Housing completions will be assessed annually against the housing requirement to monitor performance and determine whether any action is required to improve delivery rates. This will be reported in the Authority Monitoring Report (AMR).4.17 With regards to the objectively assessed need 
for employment land, the ELR identiﬁes a need for between 95 and 115 hectares of employment land (for B Use Classes) over the plan period. The Plan identiﬁes a number of Primary and Key Employment Sites throughout the city to meet this requirement. The distribution of available employment land is set out in the table below. 
 
Table 3: Employment Land Supply by Sub-Area 
4.18 With regard to retail needs, the Sunderland 
Retail Needs Assessment (2016) identiﬁes the need for 45,400m
2 of comparison ﬂoorspace 
over the plan period, based on a static retention rate. Site speciﬁc allocations will  be identiﬁed through the A&D Plan to meet this requirement. 
4.19 In line with sustainable development principles 
(as deﬁned in the NPPF) and the need to make the most efﬁcient use of resources, the spatial strategy gives a clear priority for development to be located within the Existing Urban Area. However, encouraging the effective re-use of suitable previously developed sites will only meet a limited proportion of our overall need for new homes and may not necessarily deliver signiﬁcant infrastructure improvements.  
4.20 The council is taking a very proactive approach 
to bringing forward as much previously developed land as possible, but despite Sunderland’s strong record for bringing previously developed land back into use, much of the remaining brownﬁeld land is highly constrained through contamination or other factors which affect development viability. The latest Viability Assessment has concluded that this is very challenging and in some cases it has concluded that sites are unviable and should not be relied upon in the supply.

available land supply distribution
Washington 47%
Coalﬁeld 22%
Sunderland South 25%
Sunderland North 6%Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 374.21 The council will continue to explore 
opportunities to work with land owners of unviable brownﬁeld sites to see these sites brought forward and assist in the wider regeneration of the city. This spatial strategy has sought to maximise the use of all possible suitable and viable previously developed land sites in its housing supply and included all of those that have a realistic prospect of delivery within the plan period. 
4.22 The SHLAA (May 2019 update) has identiﬁed 
that approximately 10,559 new homes (which includes the Housing Growth Areas) can be delivered in the Existing Urban Area on a mixture of brownﬁeld sites (41%) and greenﬁeld sites (59%). As set out in the Housing Trajectory (Figure 34), 24% of the housing requirement (based on 13,410) has already been delivered, 24% has planning permission or is under construction, and a further 19% is on Strategic Sites (Vaux and SSGA, most of which also have planning permission). The allocation of eight Housing Growth Areas through this Plan provide around 7% of the overall housing supply. To deliver the remainder of the housing requirement, the council will utilise the SHLAA to allocate housing sites in the Existing Urban Area through the A&D Plan.  
4.23 It is also important that this Plan directs the 
growth in both employment and housing supply to the locations best suited and most attractive to the market, whilst ensuring there are no locations that are over-burdened by development, or that other locations are not starved of growth. As set out in the Sunderland today chapter, the city has experienced a disproportionate distribution of housing development over recent years. The housing distribution is such that the majority of the housing land is located in South Sunderland (43%) and Coalﬁeld (30%) sub-areas. In part, this has been as a consequence of the lack of available housing sites in the northern part of the city, which can be largely attributed to the presence of the Tyne and Wear Green Belt, which places a heavy constraint on the supply of suitable development land. Subsequently, locations such as Washington and Springwell Village have experienced limited development over a number of years. The broad distribution of housing is set out in Table 4 below. 
Table 4: Broad housing distribution 
(Table includes HGA’s and excludes small sites and demolitions) 
4.24 Conversely, much of the southern part of  
the city is not constrained by Green Belt  and therefore a signiﬁcant quantum of  housing development has been channelled towards the Coalﬁeld and South Sunderland sub-areas. The strategy seeks to rebalance  this distribution by ensuring that the needs  of the entire city are met. Future development within the Settlement Breaks and the  Open Countryside in the southern part of  the city could have major impacts on both infrastructure and the environment and  this approach is becoming more and  more unsustainable.  
4.25 Our spatial strategy acknowledges that, as 
development opportunities within the urban area become more limited, some development on land outside the current urban area will be required. The council has identiﬁed land in the Settlement Breaks and the Open Countryside which are considered to be suitable for housing development through the SHLAA. However, in order to meet the housing requirement there still remains a shortfall of land to deliver around 111 dwellings.  
4.26 Prior to considering amending the Green Belt 
boundaries, the council has taken a proactive approach to identify alternative sources of land supply. The starting point for every local authority is that the decision to amend Green Belt boundaries should only arise after all reasonable and acceptable efforts have been taken to maximise the amount of development within the urban area, optimising densities and ensuring that all land is appropriately used.

Urban Core 7%
South Sunderland 43%

Washington 9%Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 384.27 Whilst increasing densities has been 
considered as an option, the SHMA indicates that the main shortfalls in house types within the city are for larger detached family dwellings and bungalows. Increasing densities would therefore not assist the council in meeting the housing needs of the city. The council also considered alternative sources of land supply including assessing employment land, greenspaces and greenﬁeld land for potential suitability. In addition, the council through its Duty to Cooperate conversations with neighbouring authorities has asked other councils in the area if they can accommodate this shortfall without the need to develop within their own Green Belt.  
4.28 To meet the identiﬁed shortfall, the council has 
concluded that the most sustainable solution requires us to amend the Green Belt boundary. The council has undertaken an extensive Green Belt assessment to identify land which would cause the least harm to the purposes of the Green Belt, is suitable for development and could create a new defensible Green Belt boundary. Through this work, the council has also established the exceptional circumstances to justify amending the Green Belt boundary. Without alterations to the Green Belt boundaries, the Plan would not be able to accommodate housing needs, especially in the north of the city (Washington and North Sunderland sub-areas).  
4.29 The spatial strategy allocates 8 Housing 
Growth Areas (HGAs) (Policies SS2, SS4 and SS7) and amends the Green Belt boundary (as deﬁned on the Policies Map). These HGAs will be able to deliver approximately 930 new homes during the plan period. These sites range in size from 30 homes to 400 homes. These sites are considered to be the most appropriate and suitable locations for the future expansion of our Existing Urban Area.  
4.30 Furthermore, and in line with the NPPF, the 
council has identiﬁed ‘Safeguarded Land’ in order to provide a degree of permanence to the Green Belt boundaries in the longer term, so that they should be capable of enduring beyond the plan period.4.31 The spatial strategy seeks to protect 
greenspaces in the city, including the Settlement Breaks, which form valuable breaks between distinct settlements within Sunderland. The spatial strategy proposes  to continue their designation and prevent further encroachment. 
4.32 In order to deliver this level of growth, the 
strategy will ensure that necessary infrastructure, services and facilities are delivered. An Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) has been prepared alongside this Plan, which identiﬁes the key infrastructure requirements, anticipated costs and expected delivery. The IDP is a ‘live’ document that the council will monitor and review on a regular basis to reﬂect the current circumstances and to inform the Development Management process. The Infrastructure Schedule contained within the IDP sets out an overview of the key infrastructure requirements necessary to deliver this Plan.  
4.33 The following section sets out how the  
spatial strategy relates to each sub-area  in Sunderland. 
Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 39Urban core  
 
Figure 16: Urban core key diagram 
  
4.34 The Urban Core, as designated on the Policies 
Map, is the main administrative centre of Sunderland. It is the focus for a wide range of civic, retail, cultural and leisure functions and is also home to both campuses of the University of Sunderland. It is a highly accessible location by a range of public transport options including rail, metro and bus services. 
4.35 Policy SP2 sets the strategic policy approach 
for the Urban Core. The strategy seeks to transform the Urban Core into a more attractive and vibrant place, a place where people gather to socialise, work, live and play. A new revitalised Urban Core will be the catalyst for the city’s wider economic growth and will help Sunderland retain and attract more highly skilled workers and increased population and visitor numbers. 
4.36 The Urban Core should be a focus for main 
town centre uses, especially retail and ofﬁce use. Within the Urban Core the council has identiﬁed a number of Areas of Change. These are identiﬁed on Figure 16, and also include the Heritage Action Zone (HAZ), which is a ﬁve-year initiative encompassing the Old Sunderland Conservation Area, the Old Sunderland Riverside Conservation Area and part of the Sunniside Conservation Area and focusses on reconnecting Fawcett Street, Church Street, High Street East and High Street West with the modern city centre. These areas offer opportunities to transform the Urban Core. Policy SP2 seeks to direct different forms of development to the most appropriate locations to consolidate and improve these distinct areas within the Urban Core. 
Strategic Policy  
SP2 Urban Core  
The Urban Core will be regenerated and 
transformed into a vibrant and distinctive area by:  
1. increasing the range and type of ofﬁce 
accommodation, prioritising this at The Vaux (Policy SS1); 
2. concentrating retail development in the 
Primary Shopping Area, (as deﬁned on the Policies Map) (Policy VC3); 
3. supporting the development of higher  
and further education facilities at  University Campus;  
4. promoting mixed use development in the 
Areas of Change: 
i. Sunniside – residential led mixed use; ii. Heritage Action Zone – heritage led 
mixed use development; 
iii. Minster Quarter – culture led mixed use; iv. Holmeside – civic and commercial led 
mixed use; and v. Stadium Village – leisure led mixed use; 
5. growing the leisure, tourism and cultural 
economy; and  
6. diversifying the residential offer to create 
sustainable mixed communities.  
Development in the Urban Core should: 
i. make improvements to connectivity and 
pedestrian movement in the Urban Core; 
ii. provide a high quality of public realm to 
create attractive and usable spaces; 
iii. protect and enhance heritage assets; and  iv. ensure high standard of design that 
integrates well with the existing  urban fabric.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 404.37 It is also important that the Urban Core is not 
purely focussed on employment uses, but also accommodates a wide range of good quality residential provision. This will help to support the vibrancy of the Urban Core and in particular support the evening economy. Developments will need to provide ﬂexible and adaptable accommodation, meeting a range of needs, including those of students and families. 
4.38 The A&D Plan will allocate/designate sites 
required to meet this strategy. Through the emerging Movement Strategy, the council will seek to improve accessibility and movement through and to the Urban Core. Movement through and around the Urban Core must ensure that the relationship between vehicular trafﬁc, pedestrians and cyclists maximises accessibility for all users. 
4.39 The Vaux is an opportunity to bring Grade A 
ofﬁce space into Sunderland as there is currently very little Grade A space. Therefore companies requiring this space are taking their business outside of Sunderland. The Vaux provides a huge opportunity to have a positive impact on the future of the city’s economy. The north west corner of The Vaux offers an opportunity for new homes to create a truly sustainable urban neighbourhood. Policy SS1 allocates the Vaux as a strategic site.  
 
Figure 17: The Vaux  
4.40 This gateway site to the Urban Core will 
include ofﬁce, residential and leisure areas.  The comprehensive development of the site should be designed to link to the rest of the Urban Core through new public spaces and pedestrian linkages. The layout of the development will maximise movement through the site, as well as connecting to  St Mary’s Boulevard.
Strategic Site Policy  
SS1 The Vaux (5.8ha) 
To create a new sustainable urban neighbourhood 
and a new gateway into the Urban Core, The Vaux is allocated for: 
1. high density ﬂoorspace (B1a) for at least 
60,000sqm;  
2. a minimum of 200 new homes (C3); and  3. a hotel (C1) and small scale ancillary leisure 
and retail development.  
Development at The Vaux should: 4. improve linkages to St Mary’s Boulevard and 
the rest of the Urban Core; and  
5. provide new public space, active streets and 
maximise movement for pedestrians.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 41Washington  
 
Figure 18: Washington key diagram 4.41 Washington is a highly sustainable location, 
with good transport links to the city centre, Durham, Gateshead, and Newcastle. The Washington sub-area has also been a principal location for employment growth within the city over recent years and is forecast to continue to be so with the development of the IAMP and the ELR identifying Washington as having the strongest employment market within the city. It is an inherently sustainable location. 
4.42 The sub-area is and has been constrained  
from development by the tightest of the Green Belt boundaries and due to the lack of available land for development within the urban area. Similarly, Springwell Village which is located on the edge of the sub-area, has also experienced very little new development over a number of years due to its tightly drawn Green Belt boundaries.  
4.43 The strategy will ensure that Sunderland 
continues to grow and supports economic development. The IAMP AAP will drive the comprehensive development of the IAMP. 
4.44 In order to help facilitate growth and provide 
homes where people want to live, a number of Housing Growth Areas have been identiﬁed within the Washington sub-area to support the sustainable growth of Washington. Allowing a small amount of new development on the edge of Springwell Village will help to sustain the future of the shops, services and community facilities within the village. 
Exceptional circumstances in Washington 
4.45 In seeking to meet the city’s agreed housing 
need over the plan period, the council has demonstrated that all sustainable non-Green Belt site alternatives have been fully considered and exhausted (including full consideration of site densities).  
4.46 Because of the conﬁguration of the Green Belt 
principally to the north of the city, there is a spatial imbalance in the housing land supply, with a lack of housing sites in Washington and North Sunderland, and over-reliance of sites to the south of the city. 
4.47 The council has identiﬁed the following sites to 
be deleted from the Green Belt to provide Housing Growth Areas:
Strategic Policy 
SP3 Washington 
Washington will continue to thrive as a sustainable 
mixed community and a driver of economic growth for Sunderland.  
In order to achieve this: 1. economic growth will be focused in identiﬁed 
Employment Areas (Policies EG1 and EG2) and at the IAMP; 
2. Washington Town Centre will be the focus for 
ofﬁce, retail and Main Town Uses. Any development within the centre should enhance its vitality and viability;  
3. South West Springwell, North of High Usworth, 
North of Usworth Hall, and Fatﬁeld (Policy SS2) are allocated as Housing Growth Areas;  
4. land will be safeguarded at East Washington

Figure 23: Safeguarded Land 
 
4.52 Safeguarded Land is considered necessary for 
a number of reasons. Firstly, it provides a degree of permanence to the Green Belt boundaries put in place by the Plan and ensures that future further reviews of the Green Belt will not be needed at the end of the plan period. Secondly, it provides ﬂexibility and allows for a Plan review if the council cannot demonstrate a ﬁve year land supply. During a Plan review, the reassessment of Safeguarded Land will involve determining whether in the prevailing circumstances there is a case for releasing some or all of the land for development, or whether it should be maintained as Safeguarded Land until the next review of the Plan.  
4.53 The council consider that the land East of 
Washington, as designated on the Policies Map, could accommodate a new sustainable community in the longer term. However, the development of this site would require a comprehensive approach to ensure that the infrastructure required to make the site sustainable is delivered. It should be noted that Safeguarded Land can only be released for development through a review of the Plan, in accordance with the NPPF. The council will give consideration as to whether an early 
HGA4 Fatﬁeld should:  
i. deliver approximately 30 new homes; 
ii. maintain wildlife and green infrastructure 
corridors along the River Wear and Princess Anne Park and limit any impact on the area’s landscape character; 
iii. retain the majority of existing tree belts and 
screening of the site, and provide additional buffers as necessary to address noise from  the A182; 
iv. incorporate greenspace on site and support 
greenspace improvements in the local area to compensate for area greenspace loss and to help minimise the impact on priority species/protected habitat in the locality; 
v. use archaeological assessments to enable  
the protection and depiction of the area’s industrial history; 
vi. include vehicle access from existing highways 
linking to Bonemill Lane; and 
vii. provide pedestrian/cycleway  
connections through the site, linking to neighbouring routes.

Figure 24: North Sunderland Key Diagram 
 
4.55 North Sunderland is a heavily urbanised sub-
area located between the River Wear to the south and is separated from the villages of South Tyneside to the north by Green Belt. The area contains the attractive beach resorts of Seaburn and Roker as well as Key Employment Areas along the river corridor. 
4.56 Due to the tight boundary constraints of the 
North Sunderland sub-area, there is limited opportunity for growth. However, the area remains one of the most sustainable locations within good public transport links to the  
city centre and metro linkages to Gateshead and Newcastle. 
4.57 Two regeneration and renewal areas are 
identiﬁed in North Sunderland. These areas will be prioritised for redevelopment opportunities.  
4.58 In order to support the sustainable growth of 
this area, the council has identiﬁed a Housing Growth Area at Fulwell in North Sunderland.

4.63 South Sunderland is the most populated sub-
area of the city, extending from the southern banks of the River Wear to the A19 to the west and to the southern border of the city with County Durham. Although South Sunderland potentially has an over-supply of employment land (identiﬁed in the ELR), the council considers it necessary to safeguard most of these existing areas as Key Employment Areas, as they are needed to meet the employment 
land needs across the city as a whole. 
4.64 One of the city’s key economic assets is  
the Port of Sunderland which is located in South Sunderland. 
4.65 Despite its predominantly urban character, 
South Sunderland does contain a range of substantial greenspaces, including a Settlement Break from the coast into the heart of the urban area.  
4.66 There are some areas in South Sunderland 
that are of concern which would beneﬁt from regeneration and renewal and Hendon, Millﬁeld and Pennywell are Regeneration and Renewal Areas. These areas will be prioritised for redevelopment opportunities, especially for bringing back empty homes into use.  
4.67 South Sunderland contains a good supply of 
potential housing sites including the four sites which comprise the SSGA.

Strategic Policy  
SP5 South Sunderland  
South Sunderland will continue to grow and 
become a spatial priority for housing and economic development. In order to achieve this: 
1. economic growth will be focused in identiﬁed 
Employment Areas (Policies EG1 and EG2) and at the Port of Sunderland (Policy SS5); 
2. South Sunderland Growth Area (Policy SS6) is 
allocated as a new sustainable community;  
3. the council and its partners will work to secure 
regeneration and renewal at Hendon, Millﬁeld and Pennywell; and  
4. the Settlement Breaks will be protected.

4.68 The Port is a key transport hub for the 
movement of bulky goods. It is therefore important that there is the provision of good road and rail links to the Port which are able to transport heavy freight to and from the port for import and export. 
4.69 The amount of land with waterside access 
within the Port is limited. It is therefore important to ensure that such sites are not sterilised by land users which do not require waterside access for their operations. Similarly, due to the limited amount of land available within the Port estate, it is essential to ensure that any development is restricted to port related uses. 
4.70 It is however recognised that the port estate 
extends into the former Hendon Railway sidings which are located outside of the operational port. As this area is located outside of the operational port, development for B1, B2 and B8 uses which are not port related will normally be supported in this location. 
4.71 The Port of Sunderland is a Key Employment 
Area for the city, but due to its location on the coast and at the entrance to the River Wear, the Port estate contains signiﬁcant areas which are located within Flood Zones 2 and 3. National Guidance indicates that Water Compatible development is appropriate within Flood Zones 2 and 3, however it will be necessary for any other development to demonstrate that it meets the Sequential Test, 
as prescribed by National Guidance. Where necessary, the council will also require an applicant to demonstrate that they have met the Exception Test (See Policy WWE2). 
 
Figure 28: SSGA 
 Strategic Site Policy  
SS5 The Port of Sunderland 
The Port of Sunderland, as designated on the 
Policies Map, will be reinvigorated through: 
1. the provision of road and rail links suitable  
for heavy freight to link the Port to  national networks; 
2. preventing waterside developments that 
would negatively impact on operations; 
3. supporting the use of the River Wear as  
a freight corridor and serving  waterfront businesses; 
4. enabling development of port related uses 
within Use Classes B1, B2 and B8, including offshore renewables and automotive supply chains; and 
5. requiring development which is located within 
Flood Zones 2 and 3 to meet the sequential test and exceptions test, where necessary.
Strategic Site Policy  
SS6 South Sunderland Growth Area 
Sites within SSGA include Chapelgarth, Land North 
of Burdon Lane, Cherry Knowle and South Ryhope. These sites are allocated to create a new high quality, vibrant and distinctive neighbourhood.  
Development should deliver: 1. approximately 3000 new homes to be broadly 
distributed across the four sites as follows: 
i. Chapelgarth – approximately 750 homes; ii. Land North of Burdon Lane – 
approximately 1,000 homes; 
iii. Cherry Knowle – approximately  
800 homes; and 
iv. South Ryhope – approximately  
450 homes; Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 50 
4.72 The SSGA will be an example of sustainable 
development and a destination of choice for families wishing to live in Sunderland. The development will achieve high standards of sustainability, design and provide a range of supporting facilities to help foster a strong sense of community. The creation of well-connected, integrated and sustainable transport links will be essential to making this a sustainable neighbourhood. Development will also protect and enhance existing heritage assets in the area and provide a network of connected greenspaces (depending on the form that the Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace (SANG) takes, it may be possible for part of this to also be used for public open space). This new sustainable neighbourhood will provide for a mix of housing sizes, types and tenures, including affordable housing. The 
site is allocated for 3,000 homes but it is expected that approximately 2,305 will be delivered in the plan period.  
4.73 In order to ensure the comprehensive 
development of the sites and ensure that the necessary infrastructure is delivered at the right time, the council is preparing the South Sunderland Growth Area Supplementary Planning Document (SPD). Once adopted, all development on the SSGA should be in accordance with this document. 
2. 10% affordable housing; 
3. a neighbourhood centre within Land North of 
Burdon Lane to provide a focal point within the SSGA and complement nearby existing centres which will comprise: 
i. a range of appropriate uses from the 
following use classes; A1, A3, A4, D1  and D2; 
ii. a new 1.5 form entry primary school 
which will also serve as a community hub; 
iii. wheeled Sports Area; iv. formal play space; v. Multi Use Games Area; vi. 3G pitch;  vii. appropriate parking facilities and served 
by bus service; 
4. extensions to two existing primary schools in 
close proximity to SSGA; 
5. public open space; 6. allotments provided on-site or off-site via a 
ﬁnancial contribution; 
7. suitable ecological mitigation in line with HRA 
requirements; 
8. cycleways and footpaths;  9. new and improved public transport services 
and infrastructure; and 
10. contributions to support the completion of the 
Ryhope-Doxford Link Road by either direct delivery as part of development or via a ﬁnancial contribution.

Figure 29: The Coalﬁeld Key Diagram 
 4.74 The Coalﬁeld is the largest sub-area by area 
and smallest by population. It extends southwards from the River Wear towards Easington in County Durham, linking westwards towards Chester-le-Street and Durham City and eastwards towards South Sunderland, Murton and Seaham.  
4.75 In order to support the sustainable growth of 
the Coalﬁeld, the council has identiﬁed three Housing Growth Areas to the north of the sub-area. These sites, together with further housing sites identiﬁed in the SHLAA, will ensure that the area retains a residential development focus. However, policies to protect Settlement Breaks and Open Countryside are also in place to ensure that the sub-area retains its semi-rural character. 
4.76 Houghton-le-Spring Town Centre will continue 
to serve as the principal centre in the Coalﬁeld. To the west of the town centre is Rainton Bridge Industrial Estate, which serves as the principal employment area to the Coalﬁeld. 
Exceptional circumstances in the Coalﬁeld 
4.77 In seeking to meet the city’s agreed housing 
need over the plan period, the council has demonstrated that all sustainable non-Green Belt site alternatives have been fully considered and exhausted (including full consideration of site densities).  
4.78 Because of the conﬁguration of the Green Belt 
principally to the north-east of the Coalﬁeld area, there is a spatial imbalance in the housing land supply in this area, with a concentration of sites to the south and west of this area. 
4.79 The council has identiﬁed the following sites in 
the northern part of the Coalﬁeld to be deleted from the Green Belt to provide Housing Growth Areas: 
HGA6 Penshaw 
4.80 The site demonstrates moderate impact on 
Green Belt purposes. Site constraints can be minimised and suitably mitigated for. The site is sustainable and deliverable and provides an urban extension along the A183, with the creation of a new durable Green Belt boundary to the north and east.

SP6 The Coalﬁeld  
The Coalﬁeld character and settlements will be 
protected whilst ensuring its future sustainability. In order to achieve this: 
1. the Open Countryside and Settlement Breaks 
will be protected; 
2. Housing Growth Areas at Penshaw, New 
Herrington and Philadelphia (Policy SS7) are allocated to ensure there is land for the future growth of The Coalﬁeld;  
3. existing Travelling Showpeople sites will be 
safeguarded and new sites allocated (Policy H4); 
4. economic development will be focussed on 
identiﬁed Employment Areas (Policies EG1  and EG2);  
5. Houghton Town Centre will be the focus for

local policies5.1 Many factors inﬂuence our health, including 
the lifestyles we lead, the environment we live in and the opportunities we have to exercise and access health and other facilities. A wider sense of wellbeing is inﬂuenced by a variety of factors such as opportunities for work and recreation, attractive environments, personal relationships and feelings of safety and being part of a community. 
5.2 The link between planning and health 
outcomes is long established and most recently reinforced by the NPPF, PPG and the Government’s public health strategy ‘Healthy Lives, Healthy People’. 
5.3 Health and wellbeing is a cross cutting theme 
and this chapter includes policies to deliver Strategic Priority 3 and promote healthy and safe communities by: 
                • supporting the delivery of the strategic 
priorities (Policy SP7); 
                • protecting the amenity and quality of life of 
residents (Policy HS1); 
                • directing noise-sensitive development to 
appropriate locations (Policy HS2); 
                • ensuring appropriate remediation is 
undertaken when developing contaminated land (Policy HS3); and 
                • giving careful consideration to potential 
risks associated with development of or near to ‘notiﬁable installations’ (Policy HS4).   
5.4 The applicant should set out within their 
Design and Access Statement how the proposals have been designed to take account of the requirements of this policy. Applicants are also encouraged to utilise the design principles set out within Sport England’s ‘Active Design’ guide when preparing a development scheme in order to promote active, healthy and stronger communities. 
5.5 In order to ensure that health impacts are 
considered at the very outset, a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) will be required to be submitted in support of large-scale development. For clarity, large-scale 
Strategic Policy  
SP7 Healthy and safe communities 
The council will seek to improve health and 
wellbeing in Sunderland by: 
1. working with the NHS to improve health 
outcomes, particularly in areas with the poorest health and reduce health  inequalities generally; 
2. protecting existing health facilities and/or 
supporting the provision of new or improved facilities (Policy VC5);3. promoting and facilitating active and  
healthy lifestyles; 
4. supporting the integration of health facilities 
and services with other community uses (education, sport, cultural and leisure) through multi-purpose buildings; 
5. managing the location/number of and access 
to unhealthy eating outlets (Policy VC4); 
6. ensuring that new developments:- 
i. are age friendly, inclusive, safe, attractive 
and easily accessible on foot or by bicycle; 
ii. have a strong sense of place which 
encourages social interaction; 
iii. are designed to promote active travel and 
other physical activities through the arrangement of buildings, location of uses and access to open space; 
iv. promote improvements and enhance 
accessibility to the city’s natural, built and historic environments; 
v. do not have unacceptable adverse 
impacts upon amenity which cannot  be adequately mitigated (Policies HS1  and HS2);  
vi. appropriately address any contaminated 
land to an acceptable level (Policy  HS3); and 
vii. submit a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) 
as part of any application for large-scale development. Where signiﬁcant adverse health impacts are identiﬁed, development should be resisted unless appropriate mitigation can be provided.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 595. Healthy and safe communitiesdevelopment within the context of this policy 
is considered to be residential schemes for 100 dwellings or more, student accommodation schemes for 100 bed spaces or more, or any other form of development which has the potential to have a signiﬁcant impact on health. The HIA should be proportionate to the scale of development proposed and can be incorporated into other appropriate submission documents, such as a Design and Access Statement. Where a submitted HIA indicates that a development would have a signiﬁcant adverse impact upon health and wellbeing, development will be resisted unless evidence is submitted to demonstrate to the council’s satisfaction that the impacts can be adequately mitigated. Further guidance on what detail should be contained within an HIA will be set out within a developer guidance note. 
 
5.6 Development can remedy environmental 
deﬁciencies and contribute to the quality of life of residents. New development should take into account the amenities of adjoining properties, with particular attention being paid 
to the scale of new buildings in relation to existing surrounding development, daylight, sunlight effects, siting, elevational treatments and the use of appropriate materials. Where a site is affected by land stability issues (including mineral legacy issues as set out in Policy M3), the responsibility for securing a safe development rests with the developer and/or landowner. Affected development must incorporate remediation and management measures. Cumulative impacts should also be considered. Any new developments will be expected to follow the “agent of change” principles (i.e. person or business responsible for the change must also be responsible for managing the impact of the change). 
 
5.7 Sources of noise include roads, railway lines, 
aerodromes, industrial/commercial developments, waste, recycling and energy plant, sporting, recreation and leisure facilities. Policy  
HS1 Quality of life and amenity 
1. Development must demonstrate that it does 
not result in unacceptable adverse impacts which cannot be addressed through appropriate mitigation, arising from the following sources: 
i. air quality; ii. noise; iii. dust; iv. vibration; v. odour; vi. emissions; vii. land contamination and instability; viii. illumination; ix. run-off to protected waters; or x. trafﬁc; 
2. development must ensure that the cumulative 
impact would not result in unacceptable adverse impacts on the local community; and 
3. development will not normally be supported 
where the existing neighbouring uses would unacceptably impact on the amenity of future occupants of the proposed development.Policy  
HS2 Noise-sensitive development  
Development sensitive to noise or which would 
result in noise impacts (including vibration) will be controlled by implementing the following measures: 
1. noise sensitive development will be directed  
to the most appropriate locations and protected against existing and proposed sources of noise through careful design, layout and uses of materials; 
2. noise-sensitive development affected by 
existing sources of noise should submit an appropriate noise assessment and where necessary, a detailed schedule of mitigation.  In assessing such mitigation, account will be taken of: 
i. the location, design and layout of the 
proposed development; and 
ii. measures to reduce noise within the 
development to acceptable levels, including external areas. 
3. In areas of existing low levels of noise, 
proposals for development which may generate noise should be accompanied by a noise assessment, provide details of the noise levels on the site and quantify the impact on the existing noise environment and noise sensitive receptors. Where necessary an appropriate scheme of mitigation shall detail any measures required to ensure that noise does not adversely impact on these receptors.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 605.8 Noise and associated vibration can affect and 
have a direct impact on noise sensitive uses, particularly housing, but also other sensitive uses such as schools and hospitals and impact upon people’s health and wellbeing. Any development (including new development, conversion, extension and changes of use) for a noise generating development close to noise sensitive uses will be assessed to determine the impact of the proposed development in relation to these existing uses. 
5.9 Issues of noise will be considered on a site-by-
site basis having regard to the development, site context and surrounding uses in the context of related policies and guidelines. 
 
5.10 In a heavily built up area such as Sunderland 
where there has been a history of heavy industry, land contamination is known to exist. It is important therefore that any land that is known or suspected of being contaminated,  or where a sensitive use is proposed, is dealt with appropriately before the development takes place.5.11 Any potential risks associated with 
contaminated land should be identiﬁed and assessed at the pre-application planning stage. Applicants also need to consider that sites may be contaminated as a result of being in the vicinity of a contaminated site. The risk of this contamination depends on ground conditions and the type of contamination. Where necessary, developers will be required to carry out remediation works and satisfy the council that their development can be safely built and occupied without posing any unacceptable risks to human health or the environment. 
5.12 Where a site is affected by contamination, the 
responsibility for securing a safe development rests with the developer and/or landowner. In such cases, the applicant must submit a report to demonstrate remediation and management measures to deal with risks of water pollution, contamination from site works, and health risks for end users. This report should be submitted with a planning application and the council will consult the Environment Agency and take account of the council’s Environmental Health Ofﬁcers advice in assessing such reports. 
5.13 Where contaminants are identiﬁed and it is 
determined that remediation is required, the developer must also demonstrate that a method of treatment necessary to deal with any hazards found, has been agreed or conditions requiring such measures to be implemented, can be attached. Such measures must ensure that water resources and other environmental resources are not adversely affected, further migration of gases and substances is prevented, and that appropriate remediation takes place on-site to secure a safe development that is suitable for its proposed use. 
Policy  
HS3 Contaminated land  
When development is considered to be on 
contaminated land, development should: 
1. ensure all works, including investigation  
of the nature of any contamination, can  be undertaken without the escape  of contaminants which could cause unacceptable risk to health or to  the environment; 
2. identify any existing contaminated land  
and the level of risk that contaminants pose  in relation to the proposed end use and  future site users are adequately quantiﬁed  and addressed; 
3. ensure appropriate mitigation measures are 
identiﬁed and implemented which are suitable for the proposed use and that there is no unacceptable risk of pollution within the site or in the surrounding area; and 
4. demonstrate that the developed site will be 
suitable for the proposed use without risk from contaminants to people, buildings, services or the environment including the apparatus of statutory undertakers.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 61 
5.14 Sites and installations which have quantities of 
hazardous substances present on site are designated as notiﬁable installations by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Consultation zones are deﬁned around these hazardous installations and the council is required to consult with the HSE on certain proposals for development within such zones. The council will be guided by HSE advice in determining whether a proposed development may proceed as submitted or whether protection measures could overcome any safety objections. Further information can be found at www.hse.gov.uk 
5.15 The siting of new notiﬁable installations will be 
managed with the aim of keeping the installations separate from housing and other sensitive land uses with which the installations would be incompatible. The council will  consult the HSE and the Environment  Agency about the siting of proposals for  new notiﬁable installations. 
5.16 Hazardous substances consent is required for 
the presence of certain quantities of hazardous substances. This is a key part of  the controls for storage and use of  hazardous substances which could, in quantities at or above speciﬁed limits,  present a major off-site risk.Policy  
HS4 Health and safety executive areas and 
hazardous substances  
1. Development within the speciﬁed distances 
from sites identiﬁed as ‘notiﬁable installations’, must take account of any risks involved and the need for appropriate separation between hazardous installations and incompatible uses. 
2. The development of new notiﬁable 
installations must be located in appropriate areas and take account of any risks involved and the need for appropriate separation between hazardous installations and incompatible uses. 
3. Development involving the introduction, 
storage or use of hazardous substances  which would create potential risk and could not be acceptably mitigated against, will not  be permitted.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 626.1 The Plan seeks, through the provision of new 
housing, to meet the needs and aspirations of existing and future residents, creating sustainable neighbourhoods in which residents want to live and work.  
6.2 The council is committed to increasing the rate 
of house building and seek to boost supply through policies that enable more sites to come forward for the development of a wide range of housing.  
6.3 This chapter sets out the policies to meet 
Strategic Objective 4 and to: 
                • ensure a sufﬁcient supply of housing land is 
available to meet the Objectively Assessed Housing Needs (Policy SP8); 
                • support development proposals that 
provide a mix of housing types/design and tenures to meet current and future housing need, taking into account the ageing population (Policy H1); 
                • deliver sufﬁcient affordable housing to 
meet identiﬁed needs (Policy H2); 
                • support the provision of serviced and un-
serviced plots to facilitate self and custom build schemes (Policy H2);  
                • support the development of quality 
accommodation for students (Policy H3);  
                • meet the needs of Travelling Showpeople, 
Gypsies and Travellers (Policy H4); and 
                • manage the existing housing stock to 
ensure an appropriate supply of good quality dwellings (Policy H5 and H6).

6.5 To ensure that the council maintains a 
continuous ﬁve year supply of deliverable housing sites, this Plan requires a minimum of 745 new dwelling per year. In terms of the ﬁve-year land supply a 5% buffer has been applied to the housing requirement once any over/undersupply has been accounted for. The application of the buffer assists to bring forward housing from later in the plan period where necessary and to increase choice in the market for housing. Should there be a record of persistent (over previous three years)  under delivery of housing, this buffer will be increased to 20%. This Plan will be reviewed  by 2024 and, where appropriate, will reassess the strategy.  
6.6 The expected delivery rates are expressed as a 
trajectory for the plan period. The red line is a minimum target. As shown in the trajectory, current commitments (planning permissions and sites under construction) play an important role in boosting supply initially until the strategic allocations in this Plan (Strategic Site and Housing Growth Areas) come forward, as do completions since the start of the Plan period which have exceeded the minimum target. A small sites allowance has also been included based on evidence of past delivery over a 10-year period. 
6.7 The majority of the supply (potential dwellings), 
which will be allocated in the A&D Plan have been identiﬁed in the SHLAA as being suitable, available and achievable. The trajectory also makes an allowance for 50 residential dwellings per annum on small sites (4 homes or less). No windfall allowance has been identiﬁed as sites rarely come forward that the SHLAA has not assessed. An allowance has been made for demolitions. There are no plans for large-scale demolitions over the plan period, however a number of small regeneration schemes are being ﬁnalised, as such the outstanding demolitions have been taken into account early in the plan period.  A nominal loss of 20 units per annum has been accounted for from year 6 onwards as demolitions/losses can unexpectedly come forward through the planning process.  
Table 5: Housing Supply Breakdown 
6.8 It is recognised that there continues to be a 
number of empty properties in Sunderland. Whilst most of these are short-term in nature, there are a relatively small number of long-term empty homes (those over 6 months), corresponding to approximately 2.2% of housing stock
20. The council and its partners 
work closely with the owners of empty properties to encourage reoccupation and it will continue to do so. However, historically the net number of empty properties returned to use has been minimal and as such no allowance has been made for empty properties within the supply.  
6.9 Further details will be set out within the 
council’s Housing Implementation Strategy (HIS), which sets out the council’s approach  to facilitating and managing delivery of new housing to ensure a continuous ﬁve-year  land supply is maintained and the overall  OAN is met.

•looking at ways to assist in the delivery of 
sites with planning permission; 
                •use of council powers to support delivery;

Figure 34: Housing Trajectory  
6.11 The SHMA is a key piece of evidence in helping 
local authorities understand the full housing needs for their area and the identiﬁcation of the scale, mix and tenures of housing that local people are likely to need. The current SHMA (2017) identiﬁes an imbalance of house types amongst Sunderland’s housing stock, with low levels of large detached family dwellings and bungalows. The SHMA identiﬁes this lack of choice as one of the causes of out-migration and therefore the council will be seeking developments to deliver larger family homes to try and retain population. It is necessary to ensure that an adequate and appropriate supply of housing choice is provided across our communities in terms of type, tenure, design and price, to meet the needs and aspirations of existing and future residents. 
6.12 The council will seek to ensure that all new 
housing developments are delivered to a density which is appropriate for its location, taking into consideration the character and accessibility of an area. Higher densities will be encouraged in sites which have good public transport accessibility such as metro, rail and frequent bus service and are located in close proximity to centres (Policy SP1). Higher density development will be particularly encouraged within the Urban Core. 
Policy  
H1 Housing mix 
1. Residential development should create mixed 
and sustainable communities by: 
i. contributing to meeting affordable 
housing needs (Policy H2), market housing demand and specialist housing needs as identiﬁed through the council’s SHMA or other evidence; 
ii. providing a mix of house types,  
tenures and sizes which is appropriate  to its location;iii. achieving an appropriate density for its 
location which takes into account the character of the area and the level of accessibility; and 
iv. from 1 April 2021, requiring 10% of 
dwellings on developments of 10 or  more to meet building regulations M4  (2) Category 2 – accessible and  adaptable dwellings. 
2. Development where appropriate and justiﬁed, 
should also seek to: 
i. provide larger detached dwellings; and ii. ensure there is a choice of suitable 
accommodation for older people and those with special housing needs including bungalows and Extra Care housing. 
3. Development should consider the inclusion of 
self-build and custom house building plots.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 656.13 In order to ensure choice in the housing stock 
for the city’s ageing population, developments should consider alternative designs and layouts to provide for those older people who may want to stay within their own home and take on board appropriate evidence to ensure suitable accommodation for older people and those with special housing needs is provided, where a need is demonstrated, particularly in highly accessible locations. 
6.14 Policy H1 seeks to ensure that new housing 
supply meets the needs of an ageing population, in recognition that almost a  quarter of Sunderland’s population is forecast to be aged 65 or over by the end of the plan period. The SHMA recognises a signiﬁcant preference for people to stay in their own home and homes that are designed from the outset to be ﬂexible and accessible to avoid the need for ‘special’ adaptions which are often costly to install and remove for future occupiers. As such, the council will require developers to ensure at least 10% of dwellings on sites of 10 or more, meet building regulations M4 (2) Category 2 – accessible  and adaptable dwellings. However, low-rise non-lifted serviced ﬂats will be excluded due  to not being able to achieve step-free access. The council does recognise that in some instances, it may not be possible to deliver the accessible and adaptable dwellings requirement in full. In this instance the applicant will be expected to submit a detailed viability assessment in line with the requirements of the PPG to clearly demonstrate how the requirement set out within Policy H1 (iv) would make the scheme unviable.  
6.15 In order to allow for an appropriate transitional 
period, the standard relating to accessible and adaptable dwellings will only be applied to outline or full applications approved after 1 April 2021. It will not be applied retrospectively to those applications for reserved matters where the outline permission was determined or is subject to a resolution to grant permission (including subject to planning obligations) before 1 April 2021. 
6.16 The council established its own Self-Build and 
Custom Build Register in April 2016 in accordance with the provisions of the Act. To assist people who want to build their own home, the council will support appropriate self build developments as well as seek to identify appropriate small sites to assist in the delivery 
of self-build/custom house building plots.  
6.17 Development should consider the inclusion of 
self-build and custom house build plots on schemes, utilising the Self-Build and Custom Build Register. If provision is made for this  type of housing within a development and it can be demonstrated to the council’s satisfaction that no demand exists, the land will revert back to the developer to deliver general housing instead.  
 
6.18 Providing sufﬁcient homes that everyone in 
the community can afford is a key priority for the council and this Plan. The council’s strategy is to maximise affordable housing delivery from viable sites over the plan period alongside exploring other opportunities to maximise the delivery of affordable housing. Should a need be identiﬁed for a rural exception site, consideration will be given to Policy NE8 of this plan and national policy. 
6.19 Policy H2 sets out the council’s approach for 
the delivery of affordable housing when developments propose more than 10 dwellings. Policy SS6 sets out the affordable housing requirements for the South Sunderland Growth Area (SSGA).  
Policy  
H2 Affordable homes 
All developments of 10 dwellings or more, or on 
sites of 0.5ha or more, should provide at least 15% affordable housing. This affordable housing should:  
1. be provided on-site in order to help achieve 
mixed and balanced communities. However, exceptionally, off site provision or a ﬁnancial contribution made in lieu may be considered acceptable where it can be justiﬁed;  
2. be retained in affordable use in perpetuity;  3. when part of a mixed housing scheme should 
be grouped in clusters throughout the site; 
4. be indistinguishable in terms of appearance 
from the market housing; and 
5. reﬂect the latest available evidence with 
regards the tenure split and size of dwelllings. 
A viability assessment should be submitted in line 
with the requirements of the PPG where it is not proposed to deliver the affordable housing requirement in full.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 666.20 Affordable housing should be provided on-site 
in order to ensure that developments contribute towards creating mixed and balanced communities. In some circumstances, the council may accept delivery of affordable housing off-site, for example where the off-site provision would have wider regeneration beneﬁts. Where it  can be demonstrated to the council’s satisfaction that neither on-site nor off-site provision would be appropriate, the payment of a ﬁnancial contribution in lieu of on-site provision may be acceptable.  
6.21 In accordance with the current 2017 SHMA, 
the council will seek a tenure split of 80% affordable rent and 20% intermediate tenure. Current identiﬁed needs are for 1-2 bedroom properties followed by 3+ bedroom properties and 1-2 bedroom properties for older people. The SHMA will be updated regularly and applicants need to consider this as the starting point with regards to tenure split and affordable housing mix. Other evidence, where appropriate will be considered to ensure the right tenure split and mix is delivered on sites. 
6.22 Affordable housing should be available as an 
affordable unit in perpetuity to ensure the city offers choice in tenure for existing and future residents. Depending on the type of affordable housing provided this could entail recycling subsidy for alternative affordable provision or retention of discounts for future households.  
6.23 The council will use any commuted sum 
payments in partnership with other agencies and partners to: 
                • provide affordable housing on council  
or Registered Social Landlord (RSL)  owned sites; 
                • bring empty housing back into use for 
affordable housing; 
                • work with developers or other affordable 
housing providers, to increase affordable housing provision on their sites; 
                • purchase housing on the open market; and                 • any other initiative that will deliver 
affordable housing.  
6.24 In order to create balanced, mixed and 
sustainable communities, the provision of affordable housing on-site should be dispersed amongst the market housing in clusters of a size proportionate to the scale of the 
development. Therefore all affordable housing provision should be indistinguishable from other development on the site. The type and size of affordable housing units provided should also reﬂect those that are built to be sold on the housing market. 
6.25 Developments should be in accordance with 
the Planning Obligations SPD.  
6.26 The council does recognise that in some 
instances, it may not be possible to deliver the affordable housing requirement in full. In this instance the applicant will be expected to submit a detailed Viability Assessment to clearly demonstrate how the affordable housing requirement set out within Policy H2 would make the scheme unviable. Further details on viability is set out within the council’s Planning Obligations SPD. 
 
6.27 It is recognised that students and the 
University make an important contribution to the economy, by increasing demand for services, shops and housing whilst studying. Providing choice in accommodation and ensuring students reside in the city and do not feel isolated from the University and its activities, will help create the qualities and characteristics of a “University City”. 
Policy  
H3 Student accommodation 
Development of student accommodation should 
be located within the Urban Core and must demonstrate that: 
1. there is a need for additional student 
accommodation;  
2. it is of a scale and appearance appropriate to 
its surroundings; 
3. it is located within close proximity to local 
facilities and is accessible to the university by foot, cycle and by public transport;  
4. it provides high quality living accommodation 
in terms of design, layout, and facilities provided within the development, in accordance with the Student Accommodation SPD; and 
5. the layout of the accommodation is designed 
in such a way that it is capable of being re-conﬁgured through internal alterations to meet general needs housing in the future.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 676.28 To assist in the regeneration of the Urban Core 
and the creation of a ‘University City’, the council will support proposals for purpose-built student accommodation or the conversion of existing buildings for student accommodation within the Urban Core. 
6.29 Should a proposal come forward that is  
not located within the Urban Core, the developer will need to demonstrate there are no suitable and available sites to accommodate the proposed development within the Urban Core and that the proposal will not result in an over concentration of student or shared accommodation.  
6.30 The quality of the student accommodation 
provision is also fundamental. Students expect high quality accommodation with a range of facilities included. As such, all student accommodation should be developed to high standards, but the offer should ensure choice and value for money so students can opt for different types of accommodation depending on their circumstances.  
6.31 Notwithstanding the above, student 
accommodation numbers need to be managed in line with projected student numbers to ensure the city does not end up with an oversupply of accommodation, which cannot be easily converted to other uses. Further information on need is set out in detail within the Student Accommodation SPD. 
Policy  
H4 Travelling Showpeople, Gypsies and 
Travellers 
1. The needs of Travelling Showpeople will be 
met by: 
i. allocating land for new Travelling 
Showpeople sites at Station Road North, and Land at Market Place Industrial Estate, to accommodate 15 plots in the short term. Development of allocated Travelling Showpeople Sites should: 
Station Road North 
• accommodate at least 3 plots;  
• provide a suitable vehicular access to the 
site from the industrial estate to the south; 
• be laid out as such to avoid living 
accommodation on the land to the northern part of the site;  • utilise the northern part of the site  
for storage; 
• provide adequate screening to the 
existing allotments to the west of the  site; and  
• not impact upon the pedestrian footpath 
to the north and east of the site. 
Market Place Industrial Estate 
• accommodate at least 12 plots; 
• provide a suitable vehicular access to the 
site from Gravel Walks;  
• give consideration to additional vehicle 
access from Balfour Street for cars only; 
• provide adequate screening to the east of 
the site to protect the amenities of residents living on the site; 
• provide an adequate screening/buffer  
to the south of the site adjoining  Gravel Walks, to reduce any noise  impact on existing residents of Gravel Walks/Lake Road; 
• provide adequate screening of the site to 
protect the amenities of residents living on the site;  
• ensure that fairground equipment is 
stored and maintained to the eastern most part of the site to avoid any noise impact on residential properties to the west and south of the site; and  
• give consideration to the location of 
fairground equipment within individual plots, in order to protect the amenity of both residents living on the site and residents in nearby residential properties. 
In order to ensure adequate provision is made  
for Travelling Showpeople within the city the council has allocated two sites within the Coalﬁeld sub-area. Site criteria is in place to ensure a suitable form of development can be provided and any impacts on the amenity of existing and proposed residents are mitigated. 
ii. identifying broad locations at Station 
Road/Pearsons Industrial Estate and Market Place Industrial Estate to accommodate 18 plots to meet medium and longer term needs; and 
iii. safeguarding the existing Travelling 
Showpeople sites at Pearson Industrial Estate, Sunniside/Grasswell, Stephenson Industrial Estate and Herrington Burn, unless it can be demonstrated that:Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 68  
Figure 35: Station Road North Travelling Showpeople Site a. there is no longer a need for the site; or 
b. capacity can be better met elsewhere. 
2. Where additional need is identiﬁed, 
development of new plots/pitches for Travelling Showpeople and Gypsies and Travellers should:  
i. be accessible to public transport, services 
and facilities, and be capable of support by local social infrastructure;  
ii. be capable of connection to energy, 
water and sewage infrastructure;  
iii. provide safe access to and from the main 
road network;  
iv. support the health and well-being of  
the occupiers;  
v. provide an appropriate layout and 
facilities;  
vi. not adversely affect the character of the 
immediate area, the amenity of nearby residents or the operations of adjoining land uses; 
vii. not have an adverse effect on the  
health and well-being of any site occupiers or on others as a result of  new development; and 
viii. be of sufﬁcient size to accommodate 
plots/pitches of an appropriate size and, in the case of Travelling Showpeople, to accommodate appropriate levels of storage space.
Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 69 
Figure 36: Land at Market Place Travelling Showpeople Site 
6.32 The Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling 
Showpeople Accommodation Assessment Update (2017) identiﬁes the need for a total  of 33 plots for Travelling Showpeople in the city over the plan period to 2033, of which  15 plots are required in the short term (up to 2022/23) and a further 18 plots in the medium to longer term. 
6.33 In order to ensure that identiﬁed needs for 
Travelling Showpeople are met in full, Policy H4 seeks to protect existing sites, allocate new sites to meet needs up to 2023 and identify broad locations for growth beyond 2023. Due to the nature and size of land required for Travelling Showpeople plots, the sites identiﬁed for allocation are within council ownership to assist in delivery. 
6.34 In relation to Gypsies and Travellers, the 
assessment identiﬁes that there is no need for any permanent sites for Gypsies and Travellers but it does identify that there is a need for some form of stopover provision within the city to accommodate 5 pitches. This need is met through the council’s Unauthorised Encampment Policy. This policy sets out an acceptance approach to encampments which 
allows Gypsies and Travellers to reside within Sunderland for an agreed number of days, providing that the location is suitable and a code of conduct is followed. This approach has been taken due to the small and infrequent number of encampments that the city experiences, as the needs are city wide and not location speciﬁc. 
6.35 Whilst the council is satisﬁed that the 
allocations and broad locations identiﬁed through the policy will be sufﬁcient to meet needs through the full plan period, it is recognised that the Plan also needs to have sufﬁcient ﬂexibility to address any planning applications which come forward for new sites in other locations. In regard to Travelling Showpeople, it will be expected that plots  on allocated sites will be utilised ﬁrst and  then broad locations should be  considered afterwards. 
 
6.36 The existing homes in Sunderland remain its 
most important asset and as such, the loss of existing stock will be carefully considered. 
6.37 Bringing an empty property back into 
residential use or modernising an older property is considered more sustainable than its loss, as it not only contributes to the housing supply but helps to sustain 
Policy  
H5 Existing homes and loss of homes 
1. The council will support development which 
would bring empty properties back into use. 
2. Development which would result in the loss of 
residential housing stock, particularly family housing, through change of use or redevelopment will not be permitted unless it is demonstrated that: 
i. the dwelling(s) no longer  
provide accommodation of a  satisfactory standard;  
ii. it is ﬁnancially unviable to improve or 
adapt the existing dwelling(s); and 
iii. the locality and character of the 
surroundings are no longer appropriate for residential use.  
3. Where replacement housing is proposed, the 
new dwelling(s) should align to the needed type, mix or tenure of housing identiﬁed in the most recent SHMA.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 70communities. However, the council does 
understand that retention is not always appropriate and in certain instances losses are unavoidable. When clearance does occur, the redevelopment of residential areas can also help contribute to creating improved living environments by new stock being better aligned to the required house types and sizes of the area. 
6.38 The loss of existing housing stock as part of 
large-scale housing area renewal schemes  will be supported where a detailed feasibility study or neighbourhood assessment is provided to inform a Housing Delivery Plan, alternatively, Masterplans may be used to guide future development. 
 
6.39 Development for HMOs will need to 
demonstrate that they would not have a detrimental effect on the character and function of the locality, its local amenity or neighbouring properties. When considering whether there is an over concentration of HMO properties within the locality, the council will consider each proposal on its individual merits, taking account of the number of existing HMOs, clustering and the character of the area. As shared accommodation tends to provide smaller living accommodation than single dwelling houses, particular attention will be given to ensure that a good standard of amenity is in place for future occupiers of the 
HMOs. The council will require development proposals to retain acceptable levels of privacy and protect amenity.  
6.40 Article 4 Directions have been implemented 
where the numbers of HMOs in an area are having a detrimental effect on the character and function of that area. In Sunderland ﬁve wards across the city, namely Barnes, Hendon, Millﬁeld, St Michael’s and St Peter’s are subject to an Article 4 Direction. These remove permitted development rights and prevent the change of use to HMOs without planning approval. HMOs proposed within an area covered by an Article 4 Direction will be subject to Policy H6 and other relevant policies within this plan. 
 
6.41 The spacious nature and low density of some 
of Sunderland’s mature suburbs has led to development pressure for the intensiﬁcation of existing housing areas through development of backland plots. This can have a signiﬁcant impact on local distinctiveness and conservation by the erosion of the unique character that makes these places special, particularly if the principles of good design are not taken into account. It is essential therefore, if development takes place in these areas, that it is appropriate in all respects and that it makes a positive contribution to the environment and community within which it is located, to ensure the local distinctiveness and character of these areas is maintained.
Policy  
H6 Homes in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) 
Development for HMOs should ensure that: 1. the property is located where increased  
trafﬁc and activity would not be detrimental  to local amenity; 
2. the intensity of use would not adversely affect 
the character and function of the locality;  
3. the proposal would not be detrimental to the 
amenities of neighbouring properties by causing undue noise and disturbance; 
4. adequate provision for parking, servicing, 
refuse, recycling arrangements and the management and maintenance of the property can be demonstrated through the submission of a management plan;  
5. the proposal would not result in an over 
concentration of HMOs within the locality; and 
6. the accommodation provides a good standard 
of living space and amenity for occupiers of the HMO.Policy  
H7 Backland and tandem development  
The development of residential new build within the 
curtilage of an existing dwelling should: 
1. be of a form and scale that respects the local 
character of the area with regard to density, size and massing of existing buildings; 
2. have a plot depth that is appropriate in size 
and would offer an adequate level of separation between dwellings; 
3. ensure that an acceptable level of amenity  
is retained;  
4. demonstrate suitable access, having regard  
to existing dwelling frontages and street scenes; and 
5. ensure existing landscape and streetscape 
features (e.g. mature trees or other landscape features), are integrated into the development.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 717.1 The council is committed to supporting 
sustainable economic growth in order to attract inward investment and help existing businesses thrive. Sustainable economic growth is essential to maintaining and enhancing the overall prosperity of the city. This Plan will help to build on Sunderland’s inherent strengths to meet the twin challenges of global competition and a low carbon future. 
7.2 This chapter includes policies to meet Strategic 
Priorities 1 and 5 and supports economic growth by: 
                • supporting the redevelopment of The Vaux 
for ofﬁce-led regeneration (Policy SS1); 
                • ensuring an attractive and ﬂexible supply of 
general employment land over the plan period (Policies EG1 and EG2); 
                • supporting developments which enhance 
automotive industries and advanced manufacturing, particularly at the IAMP; and 
                • supporting development of key sectors 
such as education, health, high-tech and knowledge-based industries. 
7.3 These policies will support the growth 
ambitions identiﬁed through the council’s Economic Masterplan, the Economic Leadership Board’s 3,6,9 Vision and the NELEP’s Strategic Economic Plan. 
7.4 Primary Employment Areas and Key 
Employment Areas make up the city’s designated general employment land portfolio. Totalling 1,073 hectares (rounded), these designated employment sites play an important role in meeting economic growth and employment needs. Overall, 30 sites have been designated as either Primary Employment Areas (13 sites) or Key Employment Areas (17 sites). As of 31 March 2019, there is an estimated 84.07 hectares of general available employment land 
21. 
Completions between the start of the plan period to the 31 March 2019 totalled 13.42 hectares. Table 6 identiﬁes components of 
supply. Tables 7 and 8 below set out designated employment sites by overall size and available employment land on each of the 30 designated allocations. 
7.5 Some small scale ancillary uses will be 
supported in Primary Employment Areas where this meets the day to day needs of workers on the employment sites.

7.6 Primary Employment Areas (PEAs) are those 
existing employment areas which are considered essential to the long-term success of Sunderland. These are located in the strongest demand areas and should be protected from non-employment uses which could impact upon their viability as employment locations. 
7.7 While the policy will consider development for 
uses that are not within the B Use Classes, these will only be supported in exceptional circumstances as it is the council’s intention to protect Primary Employment Areas from non- employment uses (B Use Classes).i. Doxford International (PEA11); 
ii. Hylton Riverside (PEA12); and iii. Rainton Bridge South (PEA13). 
3. Development within the Primary Employment 
Areas that is not within a B Use Class will not normally be permitted; unless: 
i. for small ancillary uses where these can 
be shown to genuinely support, maintain or enhance the business and employment function of the area (shops (A1) including sandwich bars or Cafes (A3) including snack bars); 
ii. the maximum permitted ﬂoorspace for 
individual ancillary units will be 50sqm (gross); and 
iii. the number and distribution of units 
would result in an over-concentration that might affect the function and appearance of the area.  
4. Exceptionally, other uses will be considered on 
their merits. In all cases new uses must: 
i. be of a type, scale and appearance 
compatible with the established character and function of the Primary Employment Area; 
ii. not adversely prejudice the day-to-day 
operation of the Primary Employment Area through parking, trafﬁc generation or pedestrian movement; and 
iii. not result in an unacceptable dilution of 
the employment function of the Primary Employment Area.
Policy  
EG1 Primary employment areas 
1. The following areas are allocated as Primary 
Employment Areas (as designated on the Policies Map) and will be safeguarded for B1 (Business – excluding B1a), B2 (General Industrial) and B8 (Storage and Distribution) employment uses: 
i. Sunrise Business Park (PEA1); ii. Rainton Bridge (North) (PEA2); iii. Glover (PEA3); iv. Pattinson North (PEA4); v. Pattinson South (PEA5); vi. Stephenson (PEA6); vii. Wear (PEA7); viii. Nissan (PEA8); ix. Turbine Park (PEA9); and x. Hillthorn Farm (PEA10). 
2. The following areas are allocated as Primary 
Employment Areas and will be safeguarded for B1 (Business), B2 (General Industrial) and B8 (Storage and Distribution) employment uses:Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 75 
7.8 Key Employment Areas (KEAs) are those 
existing employment areas which are still required to meet anticipated needs for employment ﬂoorspace over the plan  period, but are recognised as older and less effective employment areas, in locations of weaker demand.  
7.9 To avoid the long term protection of 
employment land where there is no reasonable prospect of it being used for that purpose, the council has adopted a more ﬂexible approach. Key Employment Areas can be used for alternative uses where it can be demonstrated that they are no longer required to meet employment needs and the proposed alternative development would be appropriate in that location. 
7.10 In respect of point iv), the council will require a 
statement of the efforts that have been made to market the land or premises for employment development (within Use Classes B1, B2 and/or B8). The statement shall include clear and genuine evidence demonstrating that the land/premises has been widely marketed through an agent/surveyor dealing in commercial property at a price that reﬂects its current market value for B Use Class employment purposes for at least the last 24 months continuously and that no reasonable offer has been refused. Statements will be considered by the in-house property team whom regularly monitor the employment market and local land values. 
 iv. the site has been unused for employment 
uses for at least 24 months, despite having been properly marketed on reasonable terms.
Policy  
EG3 Other employment sites 
For non-designated employment sites, 
development will be supported for: 
1. new employment uses or extensions to 
existing employment uses; and 
2. the change of use or redevelopment of land or 
premises that are presently in employment uses if there are regeneration beneﬁts or there is no reasonable prospect of the land being used for employment uses, and the development is considered to be acceptable.Policy  
EG2 Key employment areas  
1. The following are allocated as Key 
Employment Areas (as designated on the Policies Map) and will be safeguarded for B1 (Business – excluding B1a), B2 (General Industrial) and B8 (Storage and Distribution) employment uses: 
i. Hendon (KEA1); ii. Leechmere (KEA2); iii. Pennywell (KEA3); iv. Pallion (KEA4); v. Pallion Shipyard (KEA5); vi. Deptford (KEA6); vii. Low Southwick (KEA7); viii. North Hylton Road (KEA8); ix. Armstrong (KEA9); x. Crowther (KEA10); xi. Hertburn (KEA11); xii. Parsons (KEA12); xiii. Swan (KEA13); xiv. New Herrington (KEA14); xv. Dubmire (KEA15); xvi. Houghton Market Place (KEA16); and xvii. Hetton Lyons East (KEA17). 
2. The release of vacant land or premises within 
Key Employment Areas to uses outside the B Use Classes will only be considered acceptable where it can be demonstrated that: 
i. the council’s current Employment Land 
Review recommends its release for another purpose, or it can be demonstrated through alternative evidence to the council’s satisfaction  that a site is no longer needed or capable of accommodating B Use Class employment uses;  
ii. the integrity, function and operation  
of the remaining Key Employment  Area for employment purposes is not adversely affected;  
iii. the site is of an insufﬁcient quality and/or 
suitability to accommodate existing types of industrial demand; andCore Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 767.11 There are also a number of existing employment 
sites which are not designated as Primary or Key Employment Areas. These tend to be older, less marketable employment sites close to, or within residential areas, where proposals for redevelopment for other uses – could give rise to signiﬁcant regeneration beneﬁts. 
7.12 Whilst the council will continue to support 
these existing businesses, it is also necessary for the Plan to allow ﬂexibility for them to be reused for alternative forms of appropriate development. 
7.13 Policy EG3 applies to existing employment land 
which does not fall within a Primary Employment Area, Key Employment Area, the Port of Sunderland, the IAMP, or the strategic allocation at The Vaux. 
 
7.14 Whilst the established employment areas will 
be the most appropriate location for businesses, it is acknowledged that in order to maximise opportunities to grow the local economy and be responsive to changing market conditions, there may be occasions where a certain use requires a location outside of these areas. Policy EG4 seeks to provide this additional ﬂexibility by supporting such development where it would be acceptable in all other regards. 
7.15 Designated employment areas are considered 
to be the Primary Employment Areas, Key Employment Areas, the Port of Sunderland and the IAMP. The council will require applicants to provide a detailed statement justifying why the proposals cannot be accommodated within designated employment areas. This should include evidence that the proposal would not adversely impact upon the functionality of existing employment areas. 7.16 Ofﬁce development (Use Class B1a) is 
considered to be a main town centre use, which should be directed to designated centres in accordance with the NPPF. Policy EG4 therefore does not apply to proposals for ofﬁce development. 
7.17 In order to improve the vitality and viability of 
the Urban Core, Policy EG5 seeks to direct most new ofﬁce development to The Vaux, which is identiﬁed as a strategic allocation for ofﬁce-led development under Policy SS1. 
 
7.18 Ofﬁce development is recognised as a main 
town centre/Urban Core use therefore, it is considered to be appropriate development within designated centres. The development of new ofﬁce ﬂoorspace in designated centres, as identiﬁed within the retail hierarchy set out in Policy VC1 will generally be supported. 
7.19 It is also recognised that some of the Primary 
Employment Areas are also business parks which contain predominantly ofﬁce uses, therefore it would be appropriate to continue to support the development of ofﬁces in these locations. The Primary Employment Areas where ofﬁce development will continue to be supported are at Doxford International, Hylton Riverside and Rainton Bridge South. 
7.20 The development of new ofﬁce ﬂoorspace in 
other locations (including Primary Employment Areas and Key Employment Areas not speciﬁed under Policy EG5 criterion 2) will normally be resisted unless they are ancillary to the principal use, or it can be demonstrated to the council’s satisfaction that it is necessary for the development to be located there for operational reasons.
Policy  
EG5 Ofﬁces 
Development for ofﬁces (Use Class B1a) should be 
prioritised within the following locations: 
1. The Vaux strategic site allocation (Policy SS1); 2. Primary Employment Areas at Doxford 
International, Hylton Riverside and Rainton Bridge South (PEA11, PEA12 and PEA13); and 
3. within other designated centres as identiﬁed 
within the retail hierarchy set out in Policy VC1.Policy  
EG4 New employment areas 
Development for new employment uses (B1 – 
(excluding B1a), B2 and B8 uses) outside of designated employment areas must demonstrate that the proposed use: 
1. cannot be accommodated within the 
designated employment areas;  
2. can be provided with appropriate vehicular 
access; and 
3. would not be detrimental to local amenity.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 77 
7.21 Certain business uses found in employment 
areas require an ancillary trade counter for the sale of goods.  
7.22 In order to retain the employment character of 
these employment areas, it is important that the retailing element does not become over-dominant. To ensure that this is the case, Policy EG6 seeks to ensure that a maximum of 15% of internal ﬂoorspace may be permitted to be used for sales. 
7.23 In order to protect the vitality and viability of 
existing centres, it should be ensured that any trade counter development is not of a sufﬁcient scale that is likely to have a signiﬁcant adverse impact upon the designated centres. The policy therefore establishes an upper limit of 500m
2 for 
ancillary retail use, which is consistent with the lowest of the locally set impact assessment thresholds in Policy VC2. 
7.24 For clarity, in circumstances where the 
proposed trade counter/factory shop would be over 500m
2 but less than 15% of the 
internal ﬂoorspace of the unit, the lower threshold will apply. Policy  
EG6 Trade counters 
1. Where industrial users within a Primary 
Employment Area or Key Employment Area require a ‘trade counter/factory shop’ this should be limited to a maximum of 500m² or 15% of the existing industrial ﬂoorspace and only be used for the sale of goods made or stored on the premises. 
2. Developments for a trade counter/factory 
shop should not: 
i. compromise the industrial nature of the 
site or area in question;  
ii. attract customers in such large numbers 
so as to impede the access arrangements; and 
iii. cause signiﬁcant operational difﬁculties for 
other neighbouring occupants.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 788.1 The city centre (as deﬁned on the policies 
map) and other Town, District and Local Centres within the authority area are an important aspect of the local economy, providing shops, services and community facilities to serve our local communities. These centres help give areas their own identity and are particularly important to members of the public who are less mobile, or do not have easy access to a car.  
8.2 This chapter seeks to meet Strategic Priority 6 
and will support the vitality and viability of our centres by:- 
                • focussing development proposals for main 
town centres uses within designated centres, as set out within the retail hierarchy (Policy VC1); 
                • resisting developments which would have a 
signiﬁcant adverse impact upon designated centres (Policy VC2); 
                • prioritising retail development in Primary 
Frontages and supporting a wider  diversity of uses in Secondary Frontages (Policy VC3); 
                • limiting the number of hot food takeaways 
in areas of over-concentration and/or areas which suffer from poor health (Policy VC4); 
                • protecting community facilities and local 
services (Policy VC5); and 
                • generally supporting new leisure and 
tourism development (Policy VC6).

VC1 Main town centre uses and retail 
hierarchy 
1. The vitality and viability of the centres within 
the network and hierarchy identiﬁed below (and designated on the Policies Map) will be maintained and enhanced: 
City Centre: Sunderland City Centre; 
Town Centres:  Houghton, and Washington;  
District Centres:  Chester Road, Concord, 
Doxford Park, Hetton, Monkwearmouth, Sea Road and Southwick Green; 
Local Centres:  Castletown, Easington Lane, 
Fencehouses, Grangetown, Hendon, Hylton Road, Market Street (Hetton), Pallion, Pennywell, Ryhope, Shiney Row and Silksworth; 
2. the city centre and town centres will be the 
principal locations for major retail, leisure, entertainment, cultural facilities and services;Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 818. Vitality of centres 
8.3 One of the characteristics of Sunderland is its 
extensive network of centres, which provide a focus for growth in the retail, ofﬁce and leisure sectors. Centres also act as a focus for local community life and ensure that services are available in accessible locations. The network and hierarchy of centres will be the preferred location for retail and ofﬁce development over the plan period. 
8.4 For the purpose of main town centre uses, the 
city centre, which is within the Urban Core, is deﬁned on the Policies Map. The city centre, Washington and Houghton Town Centres are recognised as the three most important centres. All three perform signiﬁcant retail, social and public functions and are important centres for the local transport network in the respective sub-areas. The District Centres feature signiﬁcant retail facilities and services such as banks, whilst the much smaller  Local Centres primarily cater for day-to-day shopping needs. 
8.5 These centres are the primary locations for 
shopping facilities and they also play important roles as “hubs” of the local community, providing for wider social needs.8.6 Whilst not identiﬁed within the retail hierarchy, 
neighbourhood shops, services and community facilities located outside of the designated centres provide a valuable service to local communities in helping to meet their day-to-day needs. It is therefore necessary for these to be protected in order to promote sustainable patterns of development. 
8.7 Development proposals for main town centre 
uses should be focused within the designated centres, as set out within the retail hierarchy and should be of a scale and format that is appropriate to the position of the centre within the hierarchy. A deﬁnition of main town centre uses is provided within the glossary. 
8.8 Development of main town centre uses in 
edge and out-of-centre locations will be expected to follow the sequential assessment approach, prioritising locations which are accessible and well connected to designated centres. For clarity, for the city centre and town centres, the Primary Shopping Area (as deﬁned on the Policies Map) forms the centre boundary for sequential assessment purposes. For all other centres, it is the centre boundary (as deﬁned in the Policies Map) which should be used. Out-of-centre developments for main town centre uses will only be supported where they can demonstrate that they have satisfactorily met the sequential test and would not have a signiﬁcant adverse impact upon the vitality and viability of designated centres. 
8.9 Whilst development will be focused within 
designated centres, it is recognised that established out-of-centre retail parks have a role to play in meeting the needs of residents. These are not considered to form part of the retail hierarchy but where out-of-centre development is considered acceptable and the sequential test has been met, there are merits in co-locating new developments within or alongside existing retail parks. These are often already well integrated into the public transport network and can offer sustainability beneﬁts over standalone out-of-centre schemes. The council considers the following to represent established out-of-centre retail parks within the city for the purposes of this policy: 
                • Salterfen; 
                • Hylton Retail Park;                 • Pallion Retail Park; and                 • Peel Centre, Washington.
3. the District Centres will have a role in providing 
key services including shopping, commercial, leisure, public and community facilities; 
4. the Local Centres will provide a focus for 
essential community services and small- scale retail facilities to meet day-to-day  needs, thereby supporting the wellbeing of local people;  
5. neighbourhood shops, services and 
community facilities located outside of  the designated centres will be protected  where they are important in meeting day-to-day needs; 
6. the development of main town centre uses, 
will be focused within existing designated centres, as set out within the retail hierarchy. Development outside of existing centres will be expected to follow the sequential assessment approach; and  
7. established out-of-centre retail parks – whilst 
not considered part of the retail hierarchy, will be considered to be sequentially preferable to other out-of-centre locations when considering development proposals for main town centre uses.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 82 
8.10 The Sunderland Retail Needs Assessment 
(2016) considers the need for new retail ﬂoorspace over the period to 2035. The study indicates that based on a static retention rate there is an overall requirement for 45,400m
2 of 
additional comparison retail ﬂoorspace by 2035. The study does recognise that new ﬂoorspace is not required until after 2020. It is therefore proposed that allocations will be made within the emerging A&D Plan to meet this requirement. Policy SP9 however, does seek to establish the broad spatial distribution to inform any future site allocations. 
8.11 The Sunderland Retail Needs Assessment does 
not identify any need for additional convenience retail ﬂoorspace over the period to 2035. However, it is recognised that there is limited provision currently within the Coalﬁeld sub-area, resulting in a signiﬁcant amount of leakage of expenditure. There is therefore scope for the provision of a new supermarket to service this area and this should be located within Houghton Town Centre to reinforce its role as the Coalﬁeld’s Primary Shopping Area and to promote sustainable shopping patterns. Any necessary allocations to address this will be made through the A&D Plan.  
8.12 Impact assessments are used to assess the 
potential impact of new developments for main town centre uses upon existing designated centres. In accordance with national policy, development will be resisted where signiﬁcant adverse impacts are likely  to occur.  
8.13 An impact assessment will be required if 
development is over the local ﬂoorspace threshold. Normally the threshold will be based on the closest centre, however there may be some circumstances where a lower or higher threshold would be more appropriate based on the proposal and local circumstances. 
8.14 Impact assessments should be undertaken in a 
proportionate and locally appropriate way, drawing on existing information where possible and should include an assessment of the impact of the proposal on existing, committed and planned public and private investment.  
8.15 It is important that the impact is assessed  
in relation to all designated centres that may be affected, which are not necessarily just those closest to the proposal and may be  in neighbouring authority areas. For clarity,  the locally set threshold identiﬁed within the policy is based on the gross external area of  a development.  Policy  
VC2 Retail impact assessments 
1. When assessing applications for edge or out-
of-centre retail development (Use Class A1), the council will require an impact assessment to be submitted where the development would exceed the following local thresholds:

Figure 41: Houghton Town Centre 
Policy  
VC3 Primary shopping areas & frontages  
1. Primary Shopping Areas, as designated on  
the Policies Map, have been established for Sunderland City Centre and Washington  and Houghton Town Centres. These areas should be the focus of new retail development, where possible. 
2. Development for A1 retail use within the 
Primary Frontages, as shown on the Policies Map, will be supported. 
3. Proposals for non-A1 use within primary 
shopping areas will normally be resisted if they would result in: 
i. more than 15% of each Primary Frontage 
thoroughfare in Sunderland City Centre being in non-A1 retail use; or 
ii. more than 25% of each Primary Frontage 
thoroughfare in Washington Town Centre being in non-A1 retail use; or 
iii. more than 40% of each Primary Frontage 
thoroughfare in Houghton Town Centre being in non-A1 retail use. 
4. Where proposals for non-A1 use within Primary 
Frontages will exceed the above thresholds, they will only be considered acceptable where it can be demonstrated that the premises have been vacant and marketed unsuccessfully for A1 uses for a period of least 24 months. 
5. A more diverse range of uses will be supported 
within Secondary Frontages including retail, service, leisure, entertainment facilities, ofﬁces, arts, culture, tourism and residential uses.
Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 848.20 Primary frontages are those which are the 
main shopping areas in each of our higher order centres and it is therefore important that we continue to preserve the predominance of A1 retail uses within these frontages. 
8.21 Primary Shopping Areas and primary and 
Secondary Frontages have been identiﬁed for the city centre, Washington and Houghton centres. These are designated on the Policies Map and are shown in Figures 39, 40 and 41. 
8.22 Retail use will continue to be the predominant 
focus within these Primary Frontages but there is a recognition that in Washington and Houghton centres their vitality and viability is underpinned by a wider diversity of uses and therefore the proportion of the Primary Frontages in these centres which should be retained in retail use, as set out in Policy VC3, is set at a lower level to reﬂect this. The percentages set out within the policy are consistent with the recommendations of the Sunderland Retail Needs Assessment. 
8.23 Secondary frontages represent an opportunity 
for a much more diverse range of uses within the designated centres. The council will therefore support a wide diversity of appropriate uses including retail, service, leisure, entertainment facilities, ofﬁces, culture and tourism, arts and residential uses. This reﬂects the need to diversify the offer within our centres in order to protect their vitality  into the future.  
8.24 The council is becoming increasingly 
concerned over the high number of hot food takeaways present in many of our designated centres. An over-concentration of hot food takeaways can have a detrimental impact upon the vitality and viability of centres due to their hours of operation and their inactive and often shuttered frontages during daytime hours. They can also give rise to complaints about noise, disturbance, odours and litter. 
8.25 In addition, there are also increasing concerns 
regarding the potential impacts of hot food takeaways on the health of the city’s residents. There are already high concentrations of hot food takeaways in certain parts of the city, with 17 of the 25 wards within the city having a higher proportion of outlets per head of population than the national average. In addition, childhood obesity rates within many b. the proportion of the length of frontage in 
each thoroughfare, or centre, accounted for by A5 uses does not exceed y% [with y deﬁned through reference to Table 9]; 
c. there will be no more than z% of 
consecutive A5 units in each thoroughfare, or centre [with z deﬁned with reference to Table 9]; and 
iii. if the unit has been vacant for more than 
24 months, development for hot food takeaway use at the ground ﬂoor level will be considered favourably where: 
a. it has been marketed for 24 months for 
other main town centre uses (particularly those in Use Classes A1, A2, A3 and A4), but without success;  
b. the proposal would not have an adverse 
impact upon local amenity and include the provision of appropriate extraction equipment; and 
c. the proposals would not be detrimental to 
highway safety. 
2. To promote healthier communities, the  
council will: 
i. prevent the development of hot food 
takeaways (Use Class A5) within a 400m radius of entry points to all primary and secondary schools; and 
ii. prevent the development of hot food 
takeaways in wards where the prevalence of obesity is more than 21% for year 6 pupils or 10% for reception pupils.
Policy  
VC4 Hot food takeaways 
1. Development for hot food takeaways (Use 
Class A5) will be managed to ensure the vitality and viability of designated centres by:  
i. resisting development of further hot food 
takeaways in the Primary Frontages of the city centre; 
ii. restricting development for a hot food 
takeaway use at ground ﬂoor level if the unit has been vacant for less than 24 months unless: 
a. the proportion of units accounted for by 
A5 uses in each thoroughfare, or centre, does not exceed x% [with x deﬁned through reference to Table 9];Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 85of the city’s wards are signiﬁcantly higher than 
both the national and regional averages. 
8.26 In assessing proposals for new hot food 
takeaways within designated centres, consideration will be given to the detrimental impact that an over-provision of A5 uses may have upon the vitality and viability the centre. 
8.27 Whilst it is recognised that an oversupply of hot 
food takeaways within a designated centre can adversely impact upon its vitality and viability, the council also recognise that a signiﬁcant number of vacant units within a centre can also have a negative impact. Policy VC4 therefore seeks to support proposals for hot food takeaways within designated centres where they would bring a long term vacant unit (vacant for 24 months or more) back into active use. This would be subject to the applicant demonstrating to the council’s satisfaction that the property has been vacant for a continuous period of at least 24 months and that the unit has been genuinely marketed for main town centre uses (particularly those in Use Classes A1, A2, A3 and A4) at a realistic market value for a continuous period of at least 24 months without success. This will however not apply to hot food takeaways in the Primary Frontages of the city centre, where proposals for hot food takeaways will normally be resisted. 
8.28 When considering proposals that have met  
the above requirement, the council will carefully consider the potential impacts of the proposals on local amenity and highways safety, together with all other material planning considerations. Applications for new hot food takeaways or signiﬁcant amendments to an existing hot food takeaway should be accompanied by a noise and impact assessment which quantiﬁes the impact that may arise from activities taking place and mitigates these to a level that would not be unacceptable at the nearest sensitive receptor. 
8.29 Where a unit has not been vacant for a 
continuous period of at least 24 months,  Policy VC4 seeks to limit the number of hot food takeaways located within each centre  in order to protect their vitality and viability. The proportion and concentration of hot  food takeaways considered acceptable is dependent on their position within the  retail hierarchy.   
Table 9: Hot Food Takeaway Thresholds 
8.30 With regard to the health aspects of the policy, 
a 400m buffer to school access points has been deﬁned. Within these buffer zones no development proposals for hot food takeaways will be supported. For clarity, the 400m buffer will not apply when the application site is within a designated centre.

8.32 Community facilities and local services (as 
deﬁned in the glossary) provide opportunities for residents to meet and share their interests and access essential services such as education, health care (SP7) and family support. It is therefore important that these facilities are protected where possible.  
8.33 When assessing the impact of new community 
facilities the council will consider: 
                • accessibility to their respective 
neighbourhoods;  
                • the likely number of future occupants; and                 • the impact on existing community facilities 
that are accessible to the development and their available capacity. 
8.34 Evidence that may be required to support a 
proposal which would lead to a loss of community facilities could include: 
                • the nature and condition of the building or 
site and the cost of repairs, renovations or improvements needed to allow the facility to continue in operation; 
                • the nature and location of comparable 
facilities; 
                • the potential to relocate the use into other 
premises or to another site in the area; and/or                 • evidence that the local community has 
been notiﬁed in writing of the intention to close the facility and detail of representations received. 
8.35 It is important to protect viable facilities so far 
as is practicable, unless there is an overriding justiﬁcation for their loss or exceptional beneﬁts deriving from alternative forms of development. The council will require any application involving the loss of any community facility or land last used for community purposes to be supported by written evidence to justify its loss. The applicant will be required to provide written evidence that they have marketed the facility for at least 24 months and consulted with the Local Voluntary and Community Sector and advertised in the local press. The level of detail will depend upon the nature of the proposal; the applicant should contact the council at the earliest stage to discuss this. 
8.36 Exceptions to this policy will be considered 
where the proposals are part of the rationalisation of the estates of key public services, such as the Emergency Services, the Clinical Commissioning Group (or replacement body) and the Learning Trust. 
Policy  
VC6 Culture, leisure and tourism 
1. Development of cultural, leisure and  
tourism proposals will generally be  supported, particularly: 
i. the development of Music, Arts and 
Culture proposals within the Minster Quarter, including a new auditorium; 
ii. leisure and tourism proposals at Seaburn 
and Roker seafront; 
iii. new hotel development in the  
Urban Core; 
iv. the delivery of cinema and ancillary  
food and beverage units at Washington Town Centre;  
v. the development of new sports hubs at 
Washington, Sunderland North and Sunderland South as part of the Football Association’s Parklife programme;  
vi. leisure development which contribute to 
healthy lifestyles; and Policy  
VC5 Protection and delivery of community 
facilities and local services 
Community facilities and local services will be protected and enhanced by: 
1. resisting their loss, unless a replacement facility 
that meets the needs of the community is provided, or the community facility is no longer required in its current use and it has been demonstrated that it is not suitable for any other community uses; 
2. supporting development of new and extended 
community facilities. Developments for new community facilities should be located in accessible neighbourhood and centre locations; and 
3. supporting the shared use of facilities, provided 
that it can be demonstrated that such shared use will not adversely affect the level of social and community provision.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 87 
8.37 Culture, leisure and tourism are important to 
the vibrancy of the city. Sunderland contains a number of cultural assets including the Empire Theatre, the National Glass Centre and the Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens in the Urban Core. Sunderland also plays host to a number of events including the annually held Sunderland International Air Show, Sunderland Illuminations and the Tall Ships race in 2018. 
8.38 Policy VC6 seeks to support cultural, leisure 
and tourism development, where appropriate. Leisure (which would also be considered to be main town centre use), should be in accordance with Policy VC1, as these locations are the most accessible by a wide range of transport options and would provide the opportunity for linked trips.  
8.39 Working closely with the Sunderland Music 
Arts and Culture Trust (MAC Trust), the council is committed to supporting the delivery of new cultural development within the Minster Quarter. Further details will be provided within the Minster Quarter SPD. 
8.40 The coastline and beaches at Roker and 
Seaburn are some of Sunderland’s key assets. The area has beneﬁted from extensive regeneration and redevelopment over the  last decade, resulting in increased visitor numbers and business/commercial development. The council and its partners, through the Seafront Regeneration Strategy, are keen to build on the success to date and will continue to focus efforts on the regeneration of this stretch of the coastline.  
8.41 In accordance with the Leisure Needs 
Assessment, a cinema and supporting food and beverage units will be supported in the town centre, as they will help to signiﬁcantly improve the evening economy offer.8.42 The council is working in partnership with the 
Football Association, Football Foundation and Sport England to deliver three football hubs. The ‘ParkLife Programme’ aims to increase the numbers participating in football by increasing the number of 3G artiﬁcial pitches, associated facilities and improvements to grass pitches. At least one of the hub sites will also include a commercial health and ﬁtness facility. 
vii. the temporary use of vacant buildings and 
sites by creative, cultural and community organisations, particularly where they help activate and revitalise key city and town centre locations and the public realm.  
2. Proposals for leisure uses on designated 
employment land will not normally be supported unless they satisfy the requirements set out in Policies EG1 and EG2 for Primary and Key Employment Areas.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 889.1 The policies in this chapter seek to meet 
Strategic Priority 7 to protect and enhance the built and historic environment. The policies in this chapter will:  
                • require development to achieve a high 
quality standard of design (Policy BH1); and where possible incorporate sustainable design and construction methods  (Policy BH2); 
                • ensure that existing and proposed areas of 
public realm are well designed and accessible (Policy BH3); 
                • ensure that new advertisements and shop 
fronts are well-designed and appropriate to their surroundings (Policies BH4 and BH5); 
                • support the development of high  
quality communications infrastructure (Policy BH6); 
                • require development to respect and 
respond positively to the historic environment and any heritage assets within it (Policies BH7 and BH8); and 
                • preserve, protect and enhance, where 
possible, the city’s archaeological heritage (Policy BH9).  
9.2 The council is committed to delivering 
excellence in development quality. It expects all new development to embrace the principles of sustainable design, positively respond to the character and setting, as well as avoiding Policy  
BH1 Design quality  
To achieve high quality design and positive 
improvement, development should: 
1. create places which have a clear function, 
character and identity based upon a robust understanding of local context, constraints  and distinctiveness; 
2. maximise opportunities to create sustainable, 
mixed-use developments which support the function and vitality of the area in which they are located;  
3. be of a scale, massing, layout, appearance  
and setting which respects and enhances  the positive qualities of nearby properties  and the locality;4. retain acceptable levels of privacy and ensure 
a good standard of amenity for all existing and future occupiers of land and buildings; 
5. promote natural surveillance and active 
frontages, including the provision of appropriate lighting, to assist in designing  out crime; 
6. clearly distinguish between public and private 
spaces, including appropriate use of hard and soft boundary treatments which reﬂect the character of the area; 
7. create visually attractive and legible 
environments through provision of  distinctive high quality architecture, detailing, building materials; 
8. provide landscaping as an integral part of the 
development including retaining landscape features and reﬂecting surrounding landscape character and where appropriate and viable, the enhancement and upgrading of public realm and existing green infrastructure; 
9. maximise the opportunities for buildings and 
spaces to gain beneﬁt from sunlight and passive solar energy; 
10. avoid, where possible, disruption to established 
views of important buildings, structures and landscape features; 
11. in the case of tall buildings, form a positive 
relationship with the skyline and topography of the site and the surrounding area;  
12. create safe, convenient and visually  
attractive areas for servicing and parking  which does not dominate the development and its surroundings; 
13. encourage durability and adaptability 
throughout the lifetime of the development to accommodate a range of uses; and 
14. from 1 April 2021, meet national spaces 
standards as a minimum (for residential). 
Large-scale developments should be supported by 
detailed Masterplans or development frameworks, and where appropriate, design codes. Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 899. Built and historic environmentharmful and/or cumulative impacts to the 
amenity of neighbouring buildings, local character and heritage assets.  
9.3 Good design is crucial to achieving attractive 
and durable places to live. This Plan therefore encourages high quality design and development in terms of new buildings and spaces and their setting in the built and rural landscape. This policy sets out the design principles that should be applied across the city to all forms and scales of development.  
9.4 New residential development needs to ensure 
that homes are built with enough indoor and outdoor space to meet the needs of the intended residents. This will be achieved through new housing meeting nationally described space standards as a minimum.  
9.5 In order to allow for an appropriate transitional 
period, the standard relating to Nationally Described Space Standards will only be applied to outline or full applications approved after 1 April 2021. It will not be applied retrospectively to those applications for reserved matters where the outline permission was determined or is subject to a resolution to grant permission (including subject to planning obligations) before 1 April 2021. 
9.6 Masterplans or development frameworks 
should be prepared for large-scale development, in particular those which will be phased. For clarity, large-scale development within the context of this policy is considered to be that which exceeds 250 dwellings for residential development or 5 hectares for non-residiential development. This will ensure that development creates high quality sustainable places based on sound urban design principles. Design codes should also be prepared for large-scale, phased development and accompany outline planning applications. The code should set out mandatory and non-mandatory aspects of design and include regulatory plans. The need for design codes should be identiﬁed at the pre-application stage of development. Development should take into consideration SPDs on design which will be a material consideration in the determination of planning applications for relevant proposals. 
9.7 Development provides an opportunity for 
reducing energy consumption and enabling more efﬁcient use of energy, both of which are important for reducing carbon emissions and wasteful use of ﬁnite natural resources. It is important that developments are designed to mitigate climate change, and to withstand its effects. This will help to minimise the impact of development on the global environment, and ensure that buildings and spaces endure. Sustainable design also includes the sustainable use of resources, which is an important part of conserving materials and natural resources that are likely to become scarcer. This includes considering how existing buildings can be re-used, and how new buildings might be used in different ways in the future. Sustainable materials include those that are degradable, have low embedded energy, are easily renewed, or are recyclable.  Policy  
BH2 Sustainable design and construction  
Sustainable design and construction should  
be integral to development. Where possible,  major development (as deﬁned in the 2019 Framework) should: 
1. maximise energy efﬁciency and integrate the 
use of renewable and low carbon energy; 
2. reduce waste and promote recycling during 
construction and in operation; 
3. conserve water resources and minimise 
vulnerability to ﬂooding; 
4. provide details of the type of materials to be 
used at the appropriate stage of development; 
5. provide ﬂexibility and adaptability, where 
appropriate, allowing future modiﬁcation of use or layout, facilitating future refurbishment and retroﬁtting; 
6. include opportunities to incorporate measures 
which enhance the biodiversity value of development, such as green roofs;  
7. include a sustainability statement setting out 
how the development incorporates sustainable resource management and high environmental standards; and 
8. maintain an appropriate buffer between 
sensitive development and existing waste water treatment works to ensure amenity and operational continuity, in accordance with Government Code of Practice guidance.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 909.8 In order to ensure that the energy efﬁciency of 
properties is maximised, where appropriate, the layout of developments should be designed to reduce dependence on energy for heat and lighting through maximising the southern orientation of buildings and enabling passive solar gain and the use of microgeneration technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) panels. 
9.9 For major development a Sustainability 
Statement should be submitted which sets out how the development: 
                • is designed with regard given to sustainable 
development principles, taking into account the effects of climate change; 
                • delivers carbon reduction and energy 
efﬁciency levels required by relevant government guidance/schemes; 
                • reuses and recycles materials and  
other resources from all stages of development, design, demolition, construction and operation;  
                • maximises energy efﬁciency through 
internal and external layout, orientation, massing, materials, insulation, heat recovery, construction techniques, natural ventilation, shading and landscaping; 
                • protects existing water and sewage 
infrastructure. Where development increases the demands for off-site service infrastructure, it must be demonstrated that sufﬁcient capacity already exists or that extra capacity (or a ﬁnancial contribution towards capacity) will be provided; and 
                • will connect to/or be ready to connect to 
any forthcoming decentralised heat or energy scheme, where feasible. 
9.10 Since not all development involves new 
buildings, extensions and alterations are also required to demonstrate how the proposals will achieve resource efﬁciency and environmental standards. Applicants should also consider incorporating simple cost effective energy efﬁciency measures into the existing building. 
9.11 The public realm comprises the streets, 
footpaths and open spaces of the city.  These in turn are deﬁned and contained by buildings, other elements and structures.  The relationship between buildings and the public realm should ensure that streets and spaces are busy, overlooked by the fronts of buildings and perceived to be safe throughout the day and into the evening. The quality of the public realm shapes people’s perceptions of place and contributes to the character and identity of an area, helping to instil a strong sense of place. 
9.12 The construction of high quality areas of  
public realm with a clear function will aid in creating a distinctive city with its own identity whilst providing wider community beneﬁts.  The standard of the public realm provided should reﬂect the surrounding context of the local area. 
9.13 High quality public realm can act as a catalyst 
for regenerating the city, by making it a more attractive place to invest, work, live and visit. Improvements to public realm are also vital to our town centres and local neighbourhoods to support local economies and also to improve people’s health by creating inclusive environments that encourage people to walk, cycle and socially interact.  
9.14 Public art has a major role to play in providing 
the distinctive identity, enlivening the environment, creating a sense of place and the potential to attract inward investment. Development proposals in the city should respond positively to opportunities to introduce public art and work collaboratively with the community.Policy  
BH3 Public realm 
Existing and proposed areas of public realm will: 1. create attractive, safe, legible, functional and 
accessible public spaces;  
2. be constructed of quality, sustainable and 
durable materials which enhance the surrounding context; and  
3. where appropriate, incorporate public art  
in development.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 919.15 Further guidance is provided within the 
council’s Design and Access SPD. 
 
9.16 Advertisements can play a helpful role in 
promoting the city’s businesses and provide direction to locations. However, they can sometimes have a negative impact upon the amenity of an area as well as public safety.  As such, consideration must be given to  local characteristics and features of the street scene. The council aims to ensure that advertisements are designed to a high standard and contribute to a safe and attractive environment. It considers that  poorly designed, very bright or inappropriately sited advertisements can detract from the visual quality of the street or local area and so will be resisted. 
9.17 In relation to public safety it is necessary to 
consider the effect of an advertisement upon the safe use of vehicles and operation of trafﬁc ﬂow, including pedestrian trafﬁc. Control over outdoor advertisements should be efﬁcient, effective and simple in concept and operation.  
9.18 A shop frontage contributes to the overall 
appearance of the street scene and as such proposals for this type of development need to ensure the changes positively enhance the appearance of the building as well as the immediate area and do not detract from it. 
9.19 Care needs to be taken in the choice of 
shutters, as solid shutters, particularly bare galvanised or mill ﬁnished aluminium ones, can have a detrimental environmental effect, making areas feel desolate and forbidding once trading hours have ceased. Recessed shutter boxes can also assist in avoiding clutter to fascias. 
9.20 There are particularly sensitive areas of 
Sunderland where extra care should be taken over the design and materials used within new shop fronts, such as where they would affect a listed building or where they would be located within a conservation area. Proposals in such areas would therefore be required to sustain and enhance the signiﬁcance of designated Heritage Assets and take account of any other appropriate planning guidance such as relevant Character Appraisal and Management Strategies (CAMS). 
Policy  
BH4 Advertisements 
Development for advertisements should: 1. be well designed and sympathetic to the 
character and appearance of their location and the building to which they relate, having regard to matters such as size, materials, construction, location, level of illumination and cumulative impact with other signage on the building and within the vicinity; and  
2. for illuminated advertisements and signs, not 
adversely affect the amenity and/or safety of the surrounding area.
Policy  
BH5 Shop fronts 
1. Development for shop fronts and signs will be 
supported where the following criteria is satisﬁed:  
i. the design is well related to the scale and 
appearance of the building to which the proposal relates; and 
ii. the design respects the character and 
appearance of the location. 
2. Solid shutters which present a blank frontage 
to shopping streets will not be permitted.3. Proposals relating to listed buildings, within 
conservation areas and in areas of special advertisement control will be subject to the requirements of the relevant designation and appropriate planning policy guidance.
Policy  
BH6 Quality communications  
1. Development should include high quality 
digital infrastructure, providing access to services from a range of providers. 
2. Development for the installation of new 
telecommunications infrastructure must demonstrate that: 
i. there would be no signiﬁcant adverse 
effect on the external appearance of the building or on the space in which they are to be located; 
ii. there would be no signiﬁcant adverse 
impact on the special character and appearance of heritage assets Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 92 
9.21 Digital technologies have been a major driving 
force in inﬂuencing and shaping industry and society in the last few years. Changes that are currently transforming our working, learning, leisure and community environments will need to be integrated into future developments. 
9.22 The council will seek to ensure that the 
development of modern telecommunications equipment is sympathetic to our townscape and countryside. The aim is to ensure that telecommunications equipment is kept to a minimum through encouraging the sharing of existing and/or proposed facilities where this is technically possible. The visual impact of telecommunications equipment can be minimised through careful design, placement, colouring and landscaping. This will help to protect the character of an area and the appearance of property. 
9.23 Policy BH6 applies to planning applications or 
prior notiﬁcation applications for the installation of satellite dishes, microwave antennae, radio masts, cabinet boxes and other types of telecommunications apparatus which require planning permission. When considering such applications the council will also have regard to the legal requirements placed upon telecommunications operators to provide an adequate service, and any technical and operational constraints that may be faced. 
9.24 The historic environment of Sunderland is an 
irreplaceable resource, providing assets of signiﬁcant cultural, social, economic and environmental value. Sunderland beneﬁts from a rich, diverse and distinctive historic environment that makes a fundamental contribution to the quality of the environment and provides a sense of place and belonging for its local communities. The historic iii. the applicant has explored the possibility 
of sharing facilities, such as masts, cabinet boxes, satellite dishes and antennae on existing buildings or other structures; 
iv. opportunities to miniaturise and 
camouﬂage any telecommunications apparatus have been explored; 
v. they are appropriately designed, coloured 
and landscaped to take account of their setting; and 
vi. there would be no signiﬁcant adverse 
impact on the visual amenities of neighbouring occupiers.Policy  
BH7 Historic environment  
The council will ensure that the historic 
environment is valued, recognised, conserved and enhanced, sensitively managed and enjoyed for its contribution to character, local distinctiveness and sustainable communities by: 
1. giving great weight to the conservation of 
heritage assets (designated and non-designated) based on their signiﬁcance in accordance with national policy; 
2. supporting new development which makes a 
positive contribution to the character and townscape quality of the historic environment; 
3. supporting and developing innovative 
initiatives that identify, maintain, conserve and sustain or return to beneﬁcial usage designated or non-designated heritage assets; 
4. capitalising in an appropriate and sensitive 
manner on the regeneration and tourism potential of heritage assets;  
5. taking a positive and proactive approach to 
securing the conservation and re-use of heritage assets at risk, including working with owners and partner organisations to develop schemes that will address the at-risk status of the assets and exploring opportunities for grant-funding to deliver viable schemes;  
6. reviewing existing local heritage designations, 
such as conservation areas, and making new designations to protect and conserve built heritage assets, where justiﬁed, by appropriate surveys and evidence; 
7. using Article 4 Directions, where appropriate, 
to protect features of historic/architectural importance; and  
8. improving access and enjoyment of the 
historic environment where appropriate, by supporting proposals that retain, create or facilitate public access to heritage assets to increase understanding, appreciation and enjoyment of their signiﬁcance, special qualities and cultural values.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 93environment includes archaeological remains, 
historic buildings, townscapes and landscapes, and includes locally signiﬁcant assets and their settings in addition to designated and statutorily protected features.  
9.25 The council acknowledges the value and 
importance of the city’s historic environment and recognises that its heritage assets should be conserved and enhanced in a manner appropriate to their signiﬁcance.  
9.26 Some of the city’s Heritage Assets are at risk, 
and addressing Heritage-at-Risk is a key priority of the council. It will focus on working with funding partners such as Historic England and Heritage Lottery Fund, other partner organisations, property owners and developers to develop solutions for assets at risk. For example, Sunderland’s ‘Historic High Streets ‘ Heritage Action Zone is a partnership initiative with Historic England and other local partners that seeks to revive historic Sunderland and reconnect it with the modern city centre.  
9.27 The council will also seek to increase its 
knowledge and understanding of its historic environment, reviewing its local heritage designations, undertaking survey and appraisal work and commissioning specialist studies and research as opportunities arise. For instance, it will continue to produce Conservation Area Character Appraisals and Management Strategies (CAMS) to ensure that all its conservation areas are supported by adopted planning guidance. The use of Article 4 Directions will continue to be used as an effective way of conserving the character and appearance of conservation areas. 
9.28 Access and enjoyment of the historic 
environment goes hand in hand with its conservation. Proposals should therefore, where appropriate to the use, demonstrate that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure heritage assets are accessible to all user groups and that this can be achieved without harming the signiﬁcance of the asset. Policy  
BH8 Heritage assets  
1. Development affecting heritage assets  
(both designated and non-designated) or  their settings should recognise and respond  to their signiﬁcance and demonstrate how they conserve and enhance the signiﬁcance and character of the asset(s), including  any contribution made by its setting  where appropriate.  
2. Development affecting a listed building, 
including alterations and additions should: 
i. conserve and enhance its signiﬁcance in 
regards to the protection, repair and restoration of its historic fabric, its features and plan form, its boundary enclosures, its setting and views of it, its group value and contribution to local character and distinctiveness; and 
ii. be sympathetic and complimentary to its 
height, massing, alignment, proportions, form, architectural style, building materials, and its setting.  
3. The demolition of and/or substantial harm to 
listed buildings will only be considered in exceptional circumstances and with clear and convincing justiﬁcation. 
4. To preserve or enhance the signiﬁcance of 
conservation areas, including their diverse and distinctive character, appearance and their setting, development: 
i. should be in accordance with the 
objectives and proposals of the adopted Character Appraisal and Management Strategy (CAMS) for the relevant conservation area;  
ii. should make a positive contribution to 
the character and distinctiveness of the conservation area;  
iii. should support proposals for the 
conversion and adaptive re-use of vacant and underused buildings and heritage/townscape value in a sensitive manner; and 
iv. within and adjacent to conservation areas 
should be of high design quality, to respect and enhance the established historic townscape and built form, street plan and settings of conservation areas and important views and vistas into, within and out of the areas. Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 94 
9.29 Sunderland’s historic environment has a large 
number of heritage assets, both designated and non-designated, including Scheduled Monuments, archaeological sites, Historic Parks and Gardens, listed buildings and conservation areas. Outside statutorily designated areas a diversity of townscapes and landscapes make up the remainder, containing buildings of local historic and architectural value. Policy BH8 will ensure that these are conserved and enhanced. 
9.30 A Heritage Statement must accompany all 
applications that affect heritage assets, and should describe the signiﬁcance of the heritage asset and the impact of the proposals on its signiﬁcance. 
9.31 A proposal to demolish a listed building, or to 
alter or extend it in a way that would affect its special character, requires Listed Building Consent. If the proposal also involves ‘development’, planning permission is required and, in that case, the local planning authority will wish to consider applications for Listed Building Consent and planning applications concurrently. Proposals to alter or extend any listed building 
will be assessed against the need to preserve the special architectural or historic interest which led to the building being listed. There is a general presumption in favour of the preservation of listed buildings, and consent to demolish or partly demolish such buildings will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Demolition of listed buildings will need to demonstrate through a feasibility study that all options to conserve the building have been considered and clearly justify the case for demolition. Consent for demolition will not be given until redevelopment proposals have also been agreed and a programme of recording of the listed building has been initiated. 
9.32 Extensions to listed buildings or development 
that affects the setting of a listed building, (either by virtue of being within its curtilage or sited in the surrounding environment within which it is experienced) will be required to be supported by visual analysis (such as relevant perspectives and cross sections) and other technical material that enables the impact of the proposal to be properly assessed.  
9.33 The council recognises the need in some 
cases to be ﬂexible in the consideration of development to re-use listed buildings at risk, particularly those that have been vacant and deteriorating for long periods of time and are vulnerable. However, development that harms the signiﬁcance of the listed building, including its setting, will not be considered acceptable unless the degree of harm is outweighed by the beneﬁts of securing the repair and its re-use and the proposal sustains the overall signiﬁcance of the asset into the future.  
9.34 Development in conservation areas will be 
considered against the relevant CAMS or otherwise on the basis of whether they preserve and enhance the signiﬁcance of the conservation area.  
9.35 Demolition of unlisted buildings which are 
identiﬁed in the relevant CAMS as making  a positive contribution to the conservation area will normally be refused. Applications  will be expected to be accompanied by the same level of supporting information as  those to demolish listed buildings. Proposals for the sympathetic and creative re-use  and adaptation of vacant and underused historic buildings in conservation areas will  be encouraged.  
5. The demolition or unsympathetic alteration of 
buildings which make a positive contribution to a conservation area will only be acceptable in exceptional circumstances and must be robustly justiﬁed.  
6. Development of open spaces and the loss of 
any trees that contribute to the essential character of conservation areas and the settings of individual buildings within them will be resisted unless there are clear heritage or environmental beneﬁts that outweigh the loss. 
7. Development within or adjacent to the 
Registered Historic Parks and Gardens and unregistered Parks and Gardens that are considered by the council to be of historic interest, will be required to protect and enhance their designed landscape  character and setting and their natural and built features of historic, architectural and artistic importance.  
8. Development affecting non-designated 
heritage assets should take account of their signiﬁcance, features and setting. 
9. In considering proposals affecting heritage 
assets identiﬁed as being at risk the council will support their conversion and adaptation where this secures their sympathetic repair, re-use in appropriate uses and sustains their signiﬁcance into the future.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033

affecting the settings of conservation areas should display high quality designs that  respect and enrich their historic context  and the fundamental character of the conservation area. 
9.37 In considering development affecting non-
designated heritage assets and where necessary their settings, the council will have regard to the conservation of the heritage asset and its contribution to local character and distinctiveness in weighing up the merits of the proposal.  
9.38 In addition to the city’s Registered Parks and 
Gardens of Historic Interest there are several parks and gardens and other designed landscapes of historic interest in the city that whilst not currently registered, are considered by the council to be of sufﬁcient signiﬁcance to warrant being treated as if they were registered when considering development proposals that affect them.  
9.39 For Heritage Assets at Risk, the council will 
work collaboratively with developers and funding organisations and take a balanced approach to secure the assets’ repair and restoration, whilst also developing innovative ways of adapting them to accommodate uses that secure their future in beneﬁcial usage.   
9.40 Proposed works that directly affects a 
Scheduled Ancient Monument (SAM) normally requires Scheduled Monument Consent; applications are determined by Historic England rather than the council. The council’s responsibilities in relation to SAMs consist of having regard to the effect of any development upon their settings. 
9.41 The city’s archaeological remains are a rare 
record of the evolution of civilisation in Sunderland, giving people the opportunities to experience and learn about their past. The Tyne and Wear Historic Environment Record (HER) is compiled, maintained and continually updated by the County Archaeologist on behalf of the ﬁve Tyne and Wear authorities. The council is required in accordance with of the NPPF to make publicly available information on the signiﬁcance of heritage assets gathered as part of plan-making or development management. The council takes a pro-active approach towards this gathering of information, for inclusion in the HER.
Policy  
BH9 Archaeology and recording of heritage 
assets  
1. Development which adversely affects the 
archaeological interest or setting of a Scheduled Ancient Monument (or non-designated heritage asset of equivalent signiﬁcance) will be refused planning permission unless exceptional circumstances exist that satisfy the requirements of the NPPF. 
2. The council will support the preservation, 
protection and where possible the enhancement of the city’s archaeological heritage by requiring that: 
i. applications that may affect buried 
archaeological remains must be supported by an archaeological desk-based assessment and evaluation reports where appropriate; ii. where development affects heritage 
assets of archaeological interest, preference will be given to preservation in situ. However where loss of the asset is justiﬁed in accordance with national policy, the remains should be appropriately archaeologically excavated and recorded, the ﬁndings assessed and analysed, the resulting archive report deposited with the Tyne and Wear Historic Environment Record and the physical archive deposited with the relevant collecting museum. Signiﬁcant ﬁndings will also be published in an archaeological journal to make them publicly accessible and to enhance understanding; and  
iii. where demolition or part demolition of a 
designated built heritage asset or non-designated building of signiﬁcance has been justiﬁed, or substantive changes are to be made to the asset, works must not commence until archaeological building recording of the asset has been carried out and the results deposited with the Historic Environment Record and Tyne and Wear Archives.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 969.42 Such opportunities arise in particular with 
development that seeks to demolish, remove, or make substantive physical changes to heritage assets. In such cases the council will require an appropriate level of archaeological assessment and evaluation, historic and architectural appraisal and other relevant analysis deemed necessary.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 9710.1 The provision of attractive, accessible areas of 
green infrastructure, open space, sports and community facilities helps to support physical activity and social interaction, allowing people to lead healthy lifestyles. Connecting up the different communities and facilities to ensure Sunderland functions effectively is essential to support sustainable lifestyles and enhance the quality of life for local people. This chapter includes policies to meet Strategic Priority 8 and will seek to protect and enhance the natural environment by: 
                • maintaining and improving the Green and 
Blue Infrastructure Network (Policy NE1); 
                • protecting biodiversity and geodiversity 
(Policy NE2); 
                • conserving trees, woodlands and 
hedgerows (Policy NE3); 
                • protecting and conserving the quality, 
community value, functionality and accessibility of greenspaces (Policy NE4); 
                • protecting the Green Belt from 
inappropriate development (Policy NE6); 
                • protecting Settlement Breaks from 
development (Policy NE7); 
                • limiting development within the Open 
Countryside (Policy NE8); 
                • protecting, conserving and enhancing the 
varied landscape character of the city (Policy NE9); 
                • conserving, protecting and enhancing the 
natural and cultural integrity of the designated Heritage Coast (Policy NE10); 
                • ensuring that development is designed to 
preserve or enhance key views and vistas (Policy NE11); and 
                • protecting the loss of the best and most 
versatile agricultural land, (Policy NE12). 
Policy  
NE1 Green and blue infrastructure  
1. To maintain and improve the Green 
Infrastructure Network through enhancing, creating and managing multifunctional greenspaces and bluespaces that are well connected to each other and the wider countryside, development should: 
i. incorporate existing and/or new green 
infrastructure features within their design and to improve accessibility to the surrounding area; 
ii. address corridor gaps and areas of 
corridor weakness where feasible; 
iii. support the management of existing 
wildlife corridors, including reconnecting vulnerable and priority habitats (see  policy NE2); 
iv. apply climate change mitigation and 
adaptation measures, including ﬂood risk and watercourse management; 
v. link walking and cycling routes to and 
through the corridors, where appropriate; 
vi. include and/or enhance formal  
and natural greenspace and  bluespace provision; 
vii. protect and enhance landscape character;  viii. have regard to the requirements of the 
Green Infrastructure Delivery Plan and make contributions proportionate to their scale towards the establishment, enhancement and on-going management; and 
ix. protect, enhance and restore 
watercourses, ponds, lakes and water dependent habitats. 
2. Development that would sever or signiﬁcantly 
reduce green infrastructure will not normally be permitted unless the need for and beneﬁts of the development demonstrably outweigh any adverse impacts and suitable mitigation and/or compensation is provided.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 9910. Natural environment10.2 Green Infrastructure (GI) describes the strategic 
network of undeveloped land, comprising green, brown and blue spaces that deﬁne, connect and intersperse our built environments. It relates to spaces in public or private ownership, with or without public access. It includes landscapes, historic environments, natural habitats, biodiversity and geological features, greenspaces and woodland, linear corridors, and in the case of bluespaces it also includes waterways, lakes, water dependent habitats and the sea.  
10.3 Green Infrastructure provides a wide range of 
social, economic and environmental beneﬁts including direct recreational beneﬁts providing opportunities for physical activity, promoting health and well-being, mitigating the impacts of extreme weather, reducing ﬂood risk, supporting biodiversity, providing wildlife corridors, enabling local communities to grow their own food, strengthening the economy and enhancing environmental quality. 
10.4 Six inter-district Green Infrastructure corridors 
within the city have been identiﬁed (as shown by Figure 42). These corridors will build on the existing network linking the city to the wider region and seek to broaden the range and quality of functions that Green Infrastructure can bring to Sunderland. The district corridor network within Sunderland will also be protected and enhanced. This network is also shown indicatively on Figure 42.  
Figure 42: Green Infrastructure 
10.5 Our approach to GI will follow that outlined by 
our Green Infrastructure Strategy, having regard to the requirements of the supporting Green Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Development brings opportunities to enhance the network and deliver new Green Infrastructure. GI is considered equal to all other forms of infrastructure and will be viewed as a critical element in the determination of planning applications.  
10.6 The A&D Plan will identify land to deliver  
this policy. 
Policy  
NE2 Biodiversity and geodiversity 
1. Where appropriate, development must 
demonstrate how it will: 
i. provide net gains in biodiversity; and ii. avoid (through locating on an alternative 
site with less harmful impacts) or minimise adverse impacts on biodiversity and geodiversity in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy. Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 10010.7 Wildlife is not conﬁned to designated sites and 
many features serve as wildlife corridors, links and stepping stones. Sunderland’s wildlife corridors coupled with our designated sites will be the means to deliver ecological networks and habitat connectivity within and beyond Sunderland. The location of new development will deliver sites that avoid, protect and/or enhance Sunderland’s wildlife and geology.  
10.8 For the purpose of this policy the term 
biodiversity includes all statutory and non-statutory designated sites, protected species, priority habitats and species, wildlife corridors, and habitats and species outside designated sites and not identiﬁed as a conservation priority but which are considered locally important including water-dependent, aquatic and marine habits and species. Geodiversity relates to the variety of rocks, minerals, fossils, landforms, sediments and soils, together with the natural processes that form and alter them, which are considered nationally or locally important. 
10.9 Any proposal that is likely to have a signiﬁcant 
effect on a European site, either alone or in-combination with other plans or projects, will need to undertake a Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA). Where necessary, planning obligations will be secured to implement avoidance and mitigation measures for strategic site HGA5. Mitigation measures will include a combination of Strategic Access Management and Monitoring (SAMM) and the provision of Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace (SANG). Proposals for development or land use that would adversely affect a European Site, either individually or in combination with other plans or projects, will only be permitted where the developer can demonstrate that there are imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature, and there is no alternative solution. Compensatory measures will be secured to ensure that the overall coherence of the network of European sites is maintained. Where a SANG is proposed as mitigation for HRA impacts, depending on the use and form that the SANG takes it may be possible for this to also be utilised as useable greenspace providing the uses are compatible. 
10.10 It is expected that in the majority of cases, 
habitats and species of principal importance will have already been identiﬁed on a site-speciﬁc basis and are protected through national and local designations - however, 2. Development that would have an impact on 
the integrity of European designated sites that cannot be avoided or adequately mitigated will not be permitted other than in exceptional circumstances. These circumstances will only apply where there are: 
i. no suitable alternatives; ii. imperative reasons of overriding public 
interest;  
iii. necessary compensatory provision can be 
secured to ensure that the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network of European sites is protected; and 
iv. development will only be permitted where 
the council is satisﬁed that any necessary mitigation is included such that, in combination with other development, there will be no signiﬁcant effects on  the integrity of European Nature Conservation Sites. 
3. Development that would adversely affect a 
Site of Special Scientiﬁc Interest, either directly or indirectly, will be required to demonstrate that the reasons for the development, including the lack of an alternative solution, clearly outweigh the nature conservation value of the site and the national policy to safeguard the national network of such sites. 
4. Development that would adversely affect  
a Local Wildlife Site or Local Geological  Site, either directly or indirectly, will demonstrate that: 
i. there are no reasonable alternatives; and  ii. the case for development clearly 
outweighs the need to safeguard the intrinsic value of the site. 
5. Development that would adversely affect  
the ecological, recreational and/or  educational value of a Local Nature Reserve that will demonstrate: 
i. that there are no reasonable alternatives; 
and 
ii. the case for development clearly 
outweighs the need to safeguard the ecological, recreational and/or educational value of the site.  
6. Development that would have a signiﬁcant 
adverse impact on the value and integrity of a wildlife corridor will only be permitted where suitable replacement land or other mitigation  is provided to retain the value and integrity of the corridor.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 101species will not always be conﬁned to a 
designated site boundary. Sites of Special Scientiﬁc Interest (SSSIs) are of national signiﬁcance and receive statutory protection. Local Wildlife Sites (LWSs) are of regional or sub regional importance and are designated by a Local Wildlife Sites Partnership. They are non-statutory and rely on the planning system for their protection. Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) are designated by the council and receive statutory protection. 
10.11 Where a development directly and/or 
indirectly impacts on a designated site, proposals should take account of appropriate buffer zones as a way of minimising potential adverse effects and where possible incorporate or enhance them as part of the development. Buffer zones will vary in size, dependent upon different types of species and habitat involved. 
10.12 Development likely to have a signiﬁcant direct 
or indirect impact on legally protected species and habitats of Principal Importance in England 
22and those listed by the Local Nature 
Partnership will not be recommended for approval unless they incorporate appropriate measures that ensure the long term survival and enhancement of current populations and habitats to ensure the sustainability of an individual group, species or habitat. 
10.13 Dependent on the biodiversity and 
geodiversity impact, the council may require developers to produce a management strategy to ensure the continued protection of the features of interest. Such management strategies may include monitoring programmes to provide up to date information which will shape future policy reviews as well as inform future site speciﬁc plans. 
10.14 Wildlife corridors are strategic networks which 
transcend administrative boundaries and are instrumental in the movement of species within and beyond Sunderland. Wildlife corridors will be protected from intrusive developments, including certain recreational uses, though development that demonstrates signiﬁcant enhancement and net gain may be considered appropriate. The nature conservation value of wildlife corridors should be maintained and enhanced as part of any planning approval. 10.15 Biodiversity does not just occur on undisturbed 
greenﬁeld sites. Many brownﬁeld sites and built features have biodiversity value, and many sites require management to retain their importance. Where possible, these areas will be enhanced and integrated into the functional network. 
10.16 The forthcoming Biodiversity and Geodiversity 
SPD will support the natural environment policies, and this will include clariﬁcation regarding the types of development that require delivery of net gains in biodiversity. The A&D Plan will identify land to deliver this policy. 
22Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC)  
Act 2006Policy  
NE3 Woodlands/hedgerows and trees 
To conserve signiﬁcant trees, woodlands and 
hedgerows, development should: 
1. follow the principles below to guide the design 
of development where effects to ancient woodland, veteran/aged trees and their immediate surroundings have been identiﬁed:  
i. avoid harm;  ii. provide unequivocal evidence of need 
and beneﬁts of proposed development;  
iii. provide biodiversity net gain;  iv. establish likelihood and type of any 
impacts;  
v. implement appropriate and adequate 
mitigation and compensation; 
vi. provide adequate buffers; and  vii. provide adequate evidence to  
support proposals; 
2. retain, protect and improve woodland, trees 
subject to Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs), trees within conservation areas, and ‘important’ hedgerows as deﬁned by the Hedgerows Regulations 1997; 
3. give consideration to trees and hedgerows 
both on individual merit as well as their contribution to amenity and interaction as part of a group within the broader landscape setting; and 
4. ensure that where trees, woodlands and 
hedgerows are impacted negatively by proposed development, justiﬁcation, mitigation, compensation and maintenance measures are provided in a detailed management plan.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 10210.17 Woodlands and trees play an extremely 
important role in the landscape and environmental quality of Sunderland. Existing trees and landscaping can be a valuable resource and, where it is desirable to retain them (including any statutorily protected trees), the design and layout of new development must allow for this, including suitable buffer zones and details of measures to protect retained trees and landscaping.  
10.18 Development which fails to make satisfactory 
arrangements for landscaping or the protection of retained trees will normally be refused unless the beneﬁts of and development in that location clearly outweigh the loss. British Standard 5837:2012 Trees in Relation to Design, Demolition and Construction recognises that trees need to be properly protected during construction periods. This document provides guidance on planting and protecting trees during construction and the level of information required for full surveys. 
10.19 Ancient woodland and aged or veteran trees 
are irreplaceable; therefore discussions over possible compensation should not form part of the assessment to determine whether the beneﬁts of the development proposal outweigh the loss.  
10.20 Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are  
particularly important in controlling the felling and pruning of trees or woodlands which make a signiﬁcant contribution to the environment. New orders will continue to be made where trees of amenity value are at risk. The council will take enforcement action against those who deliberately damage or remove protected trees.  
10.21 The provision of attractive, accessible and 
functional greenspace is an important component of the Green Infrastructure Network that adds signiﬁcantly to environmental quality and helps to support physical activity and social wellbeing. 
10.22 The council will seek to ensure that local 
residents have access to greenspace to meet their needs. The Greenspace Report sets out in detail the existing provision and where shortfalls exist. While the overall provision of open space is sufﬁcient it does vary across Sunderland. To ensure sufﬁcient open space is provided for future residents, the council will designate land in the A&D Plan. 
Policy  
NE4 Greenspace  
The council will protect, conserve and enhance the 
quality, community value, function and accessibility of greenspace and wider green infrastructure, especially in areas of deﬁciency identiﬁed in the council’s Greenspace Audit and Report by: 
1. designating greenspaces in the A&D Plan; 2. requiring development to contribute  
towards the provision of new and/or enhanced greenspace where there is an evidenced requirement;3. requiring all major residential development  
to provide:  
i. a minimum of 0.9ha per 1000 bedspaces 
of useable greenspace on site; unless 
ii. a ﬁnancial contribution for the 
maintenance/upgrading to neighbouring existing greenspace is considered to be more appropriate; 
4. refusing development on greenspaces which 
would have an adverse effect on its amenity, recreational or nature conservation value unless it can be demonstrated that:  
i. the proposal is accompanied by an 
assessment that clearly demonstrates that the provision is surplus to requirements; or 
ii. a replacement facility which is at least 
equivalent in terms of usefulness, attractiveness, quality and accessibility, and where of an appropriate quantity, to existing and future users is provided by the developer on another site agreed with the council prior to development commencing; or 
iii. replacement on another site is neither 
practicable or possible an agreed contribution is made by the developer to the council for new provision or the improvement of existing greenspace or outdoor sport and recreation facilities and its maintenance within an appropriate distance from the site or within the site. 
The impact of development on greenspace 
provision will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis in terms of its potential impact on Natura 2000 (N2K) sites.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 10310.23 For the purposes of Policy NE4 we deﬁne 
greenspace as:  
                • amenity greenspace;                 • provision for children and young people 
(ﬁxed play equipment); 
                • natural and semi-natural greenspace;                 • formal parks and country parks;                 • allotments and community gardens;                 • outdoor sports facilities;                 • school playing ﬁelds and grounds;                 • cemeteries and church grounds;                 • civic spaces; and                 • coast and estuary. 
10.24 The Greenspace Audit should be used to 
inform development of the most suitable greenspace provision/improvement for  each locality.  
10.25 New or enhanced greenspaces will be sought 
where it can be justiﬁed, and must be publicly useable and available. Grass verges should not be included in any calculations, and heavily engineered SUDs solutions will not be considered acceptable within greenspace provision. This provision will be secured through on site provision or, if appropriate, elsewhere in the city. In some cases, a contribution to secure improvements in existing open space, rather than provision of new open space, will be appropriate.  
10.26 Major new residential developments will be 
expected to provide amenity greenspace on site. For clarity, the council considers major development to be 10 or more houses, as per the NPPF. Bedspaces can be notionally equated with types of dwellings as follows: 10.27 There may be circumstances where onsite 
provision may not be the most appropriate option for the area in question, and this would need to be agreed with the council and in conjunction with the Greenspace Audit.  For example: 
                • smaller developments may not be able  
to deliver sufﬁcient greenspace that  would provide genuine beneﬁt to  the development;  
                • alternatively, the Greenspace Audit may 
indicate that the development lies within an area with high or above average quantities of amenity greenspace, in which case local quality improvements to existing greenspace may be more beneﬁcial.  
10.28 In these circumstances, it may be more 
appropriate to provide a contribution in lieu for the maintenance/upgrading of existing greenspaces in the locality, or a combination of reduced levels of new greenspace together with a ﬁnancial contribution to upgrade nearby local greenspaces. Where necessary, the applicant will be required to provide detailed information on how and when the greenspace will be implemented and, once implemented, how the greenspace will be maintained and managed throughout its lifetime. In certain cases, a proposed development might be able to offer the opportunity for alternative provision with comparable community beneﬁt. 
10.29 Any impact to the quality and/or quantity of 
greenspace could have an indirect impact on the N2K sites along the coast by virtue of the potential to increase trips to the coast. At present, this particularly affects sites within 6km of the coast, but may also impact on sites further aﬁeld. Further detail will be provided in the A&D Plan.

NE5 Burial space  
The council will protect all existing burial spaces and 
seek to re-use existing spaces for new burial spaces where appropriate. In determining any application for the provision of new burial spaces, applications should demonstrate the following:  
1. the provision meets the burial requirements of 
the various ethnic and religious groups within the city;  Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 104 
10.30 Within the city, a total of 49 sites have been 
identiﬁed with some form of cemetery or church function, many of which are of historic interest and include designated heritage assets. This includes 10 municipal cemeteries, which are located throughout the city area. Based on grave capacity at these 10 municipal cemeteries and current grave purchase rates,  it is estimated that there are 42 years of capacity remaining. 
10.31 In spatial terms, however, there is no municipal 
burial space remaining in Washington. There has already been some initial site investigation regarding a new municipal cemetery to serve Washington. Ultimately however, the council must demonstrate an ability to provide for the disposal (by burial) for the dead and this is achieved through the spare capacity elsewhere across the city. If a new site is desired, consideration would also need to be given as to whether the new site should focus on the Washington area, or to provide a new central site aimed at serving the city as a whole. Further consideration will be given to this in the A&D Plan.  
10.32 Sunderland’s Green Belt forms part of a much 
wider Tyne and Wear Green Belt to the north and north-west of the city, as well as adjoining County Durham Green Belt to the south and south-west of Sunderland.  
10.33 The Green Belt purpose in relation to 
Sunderland is to check the unrestricted sprawl of the existing built-up area, which has been mapped to show such areas as Washington, Springwell Village, Houghton, Hetton and Shiney Row and the main built-up area of Sunderland (to the east of the A19). 
10.34 Whilst most forms of development are 
considered inappropriate in the Green Belt, national planning policy lists certain exceptions which are not inappropriate. Very special circumstances are clariﬁed in the NPPF.2. the spaces are located within close proximity 
to the communities served by spaces to reduce the travelling distance to visit the deceased; and 
3. any effect on the water table and the 
possibility of ﬂooding or water logging caused by the new provision is minimised.
Policy  
NE6 Green Belt 
1. The Green Belt (as designated on the  
Policies Map) in Sunderland will serve the following purposes: 
i. check the unrestricted sprawl of the built 
up areas of the city; 
ii. assist in safeguarding the city’s 
countryside from further encroachment; 
iii. assist in the regeneration of the urban 
area of the city; 
iv. preserve the setting and special character 
of Springwell Village and Newbottle Village; andv. prevent the merging of Sunderland with 
Tyneside, Washington, Houghton-le-Spring and Seaham, and the merging of Shiney Row with Washington, Chester-le-Street and Bournmoor. 
2. In assessing development proposals, 
development that is inappropriate in the  Green Belt will not be approved except in very special circumstances. 
3. Development in the Green Belt will be 
permitted where the proposals are consistent with the exception list in national policy subject to all other criteria being acceptable. 
4. Proposals in the Green Belt for increased 
opportunities for access to the Open Countryside and which provide opportunities for beneﬁcial use such as outdoor sport and recreation, appropriate to the Green Belt, will be encouraged where it will not harm the objectives of the Green Belt and recognise the important role of the Green Belt as a biodiversity resource.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033

10.35 Settlement Breaks consist of open areas 
around and between settlements which maintain the distinction between the countryside and built up areas. 
10.36 Whilst the purpose of the Settlement Breaks 
policy is to protect them from development, it is not intended that they should operate as an absolute restriction on all development proposals. Certain types of development  may be acceptable, so long as they are not detrimental to the character, role and function of the Settlement Breaks within which they  are situated. 
10.37 For clarity, essential development within the 
context of Policy NE7 is considered to be development which is required to be located within the Settlement Break and could not reasonably located within another less sensitive location. It may include the types of development referred to in Policy NE8 provided the purposes of the Settlement Break are not unacceptably affected. Each proposal will be assessed on its individual merits. 
Figure 43: Settlement Breaks Policy  
NE7 Settlement Breaks  
1. Settlement Breaks (as designated on the 
Policies Map) will serve the following purposes:  
i. prevent the merging of settlements; ii. assist in the regeneration of the urban 
area of the city; and 
iii. maintain the Green Infrastructure 
Network. 
2. Within Settlement Breaks, planning permission 
will not be granted for any form of development, including changes of use, unless: 
i. it can be demonstrated that the 
development is not contrary or detrimental to the above functions and aims; or 
ii. it is essential for the proposed 
development to be located within the Settlement Breaks, and the beneﬁts of which override the potential impact on the Settlement Break.
Policy  
NE8 Development in the Open Countryside  
The Open Countryside (as designated on the 
Policies Map) will be protected and access enhanced. Limited development can help to sustain existing businesses, boost the rural economy and assist in rural diversiﬁcation. The council will support: 
1. development for agriculture, horticultural and 
forestry buildings; outdoor sport; outdoor recreation; cemeteries and rural business, provided that it can demonstrate that: 
i. there is a clear need; ii. the scale, nature, design, materials and 
siting of the development is compatible with the existing development and in close proximity to it; 
iii. it will not result in a scale of activity that 
has a detrimental impact on the surrounding area; and 
iv. there are no existing on-site buildings 
suitable for the proposed use; 
2. development for a new dwelling for 
agricultural, horticultural or forestry workers provided it can be demonstrated that there is a clear need; Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 106 
10.38 Whilst a considerable part of the city’s Open 
Countryside is protected through either Green Belt or Settlement Break designations, there are signiﬁcant areas of Open Countryside (particularly within the southern Coalﬁeld area). 
Figure 44: Open Countryside 
10.39 Development in the Open Countryside can 
help sustain existing businesses and boost the rural economy. It is recognised that diversiﬁcation into non-agricultural activities is vital to the continuing viability of many rural enterprises and as such the council will be supportive of well-conceived schemes for business purposes that contribute to sustainable development, help to sustain the rural enterprise and are consistent in scale with their rural location. Proposals will need to be compatible with the existing area and are of a scale and nature which does not detract from the surrounding area. In respect of proposed new buildings, existing buildings on-site must be considered ﬁrst. 
10.40 To support sustainable (but isolated) 
development in rural areas, exceptional circumstances are supported that follow national policy relating to rural exception sites, including sites that provide exceptional innovative quality and support historic assets.  
10.41 It is recognised that in some limited 
circumstances there may be a need  generated for new dwellings to solely serve workers engaged in agriculture, forestry and other rural activities. In such circumstances,  the council will tightly control who occupies 3. housing development if rural exceptions in 
national policy can be met;  
4. an isolated single dwelling if it is of exceptional 
quality and incorporates innovative design features and reﬂects the highest standards in architecture and sustainability; 
5. development that is required to ensure  
the conservation and, where  appropriate, enhancement of assets  of historical signiﬁcance; 
6. the replacement of a building, where the 
development would not have a signiﬁcantly greater impact on the rural environment than the original building it is proposed to replace, provided the new building:  
i. would be in the same use;  ii. is not materially larger than the one it 
replaces; and  
iii. is sited on or close to the position of the 
existing building; 
7. extensions or alteration of a building  
provided that:  
i. it would not result in disproportionate 
additions over and above the size of the original building; and 
ii. it would not adversely affect the form and 
character of existing buildings and are designed to reﬂect and complement them;

9. limited inﬁlling in villages or hamlets, subject to 
criteria 1ii and 1iii above being met; and 
10. the redevelopment of previously developed 
land, provided that the site is not of high environmental value or landscape quality, and if the development will contribute to local housing needs or provide new jobs.

planning conditions. 
10.42 Limited inﬁlling in villages and hamlets may be 
supported in Open Countryside areas, provided that the scale, nature, design, materials and siting of the development is compatible with the existing development and does not have a detrimental impact on the surrounding area. 
10.43 Redevelopment of previously developed land 
will be considered against landscape quality, as outlined in the city’s Landscape Character Assessment. A site’s environmental value, whether it is afforded biodiversity or geodiversity protection and in terms of its impact to wildlife corridors will also be considered. 
 
10.44 National policy provides strong support 
towards protecting and enhancing valued landscapes. It recognises the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside as a core planning principle. Valued landscapes in Sunderland equate to those areas highlighted in the city’s Landscape Character Assessment (LCA) for ‘landscape protection’ only, which are also identiﬁed as areas of higher landscape value. These are shown on the Map in Appendix 3 as ‘Landscape Protection’  coloured yellow. 10.45 The UK Marine Policy Statement also 
recognises the importance of seascapes as part of any landscape consideration in the city. Seascapes are coastal landscapes which have views of the sea, and which have cultural, historical or perceptual associations with the marine environment. The city’s Landscape Character Assessment identiﬁes the relevance of seascape to key landscape types, and seascape issues are being further investigated along the Durham Heritage Coast. 
10.46 Where appropriate, applicants will be expected 
to submit a Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment to demonstrate that they have met the requirements of Policy NE9. 
10.47 The Landscape Character Assessment 
provides guidance and strategy for the entire city area, which is split into 8 rural landscape types and 3 urban landscape types. The assessment should be used to guide development proposals. Consideration should also be given to the Tyne & Wear Historic Landscape Characterisation Report. 
 
10.48 The Heritage Coast Partnership oversees 
management of the coastline by and for local communities, seeking to protect the natural and cultural integrity of the area whilst developing and meeting the area’s social  and economic needs. In line with the Partnerships’ adopted Management Plan, the key objectives to guide management of the Heritage Coast are to: 
                • conserve, protect and enhance the natural 
beauty of the coast, its marine ﬂora and fauna, and its heritage features;
Policy  
NE9 Landscape character  
1. To protect, conserve and enhance the varied 
landscape character (including seascape development) proposals should: 
i. demonstrate a high quality of landscape 
design, implementation and management as an integral part of the new development; and 
ii. demonstrate how the following  
elements identiﬁed in the city’s  Landscape Character Assessment are taken into account: 
a) the key characteristics, assets, sensitivities 
and vulnerabilities; and 
b) measures to protect and/or enhance the 
landscape in the relevant locality. 
2. Development that causes signiﬁcant adverse 
impact on the distinctive landscape characteristics of an area will be not be supported unless the impacts are clearly and demonstrably outweighed by the beneﬁts of the proposed development.Policy  
NE10 Heritage coast  
1. The council and partners will seek to conserve, 
protect and enhance the natural and cultural integrity of the deﬁned Heritage Coast, supporting the Magnesian Limestone landscape and seascape, biodiversity and quality of inshore waters, whilst accounting for the economic and social needs of adjacent coastal communities.  
2. Development along or affecting the Heritage 
Coast will normally only be supported where it is aligned with all relevant key objectives within the adopted Heritage Coast Management Plan.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 108                • facilitate and enhance its enjoyment, 
understanding and appreciation by  the public; 
                • maintain and improve the environmental 
health of inshore waters affecting the Heritage Coast and its beaches through appropriate environmental measures; 
                • take account of the needs of agriculture, 
forestry and ﬁshing, and of the economic and social needs of the communities on the coast; 
                • to promote community participation in the 
stewardship of the coast; and 
                • to integrate fully with adjoining areas and 
within the region to actively promote Integrated Coastal Zone Management.  
 
10.49 The topography of the city varies widely, often 
permitting notable long distance and panoramic views (e.g. of the River Wear from various points along its length, or of Penshaw Monument). These views make a substantial contribution to a quality environment and thus should be protected from intrusive developments. The city’s Landscape Character Assessment provides guidance and strategy on open and panoramic views where relevant to localities and the Green Infrastructure Strategy also provides background to key viewpoints within corridors and at key localities including city gateways.10.50 New developments can have a signiﬁcant 
impact on existing public views, and this can adversely affect the design quality, attractiveness and functionality of an area unless carefully managed. Wherever possible, developments should be designed to have a positive impact on public views by introducing attractive features into the townscape, providing new landmarks that help people orientate themselves within the city, and using buildings to frame existing views. The A&D Plan will identify key local views and vistas to deliver this policy. 
 
10.51 The best and most versatile land is deﬁned as 
Grades 1, 2 and 3a, and is the land which is most ﬂexible, productive and efﬁcient in response to inputs and which can best deliver future crops for food and non-food uses such as biomass, ﬁbres and pharmaceuticals. 
10.52 When considering applications for planning 
permission that affects agricultural land, the implications upon farming and quality of land is to be considered together with the environmental and economic implications and a statement detailing how the beneﬁts would outweigh the loss of best and most versatile agricultural land should accompany the application. For major developments where land classiﬁcation is not available, we may require the applicant to undertake work to determine land quality. In assessing such factors, the council will bear in mind that  once agricultural land is developed, even for “soft” users such as golf courses, its return  to best quality land is seldom practicable.  The need to control the rate at which land is taken for development will also be a factor in any assessment. 
Policy  
NE11 Creating and protecting views 
1. All development should take account of views 
into, out of and within the development. 
2. Development should be designed to preserve 
or enhance key local views and vistas (as identiﬁed in the council’s Landscape Character Assessment), and create new public views where possible. 
3. Particular consideration should be given to 
views of signiﬁcant buildings, including views to and from heritage assets, and views within landscapes which are more sensitive to change due to their open, exposed nature and extensive indivisibility from various viewpoints.Policy

Page 10911.1 The policies in this chapter seek to meet 
strategic objectives 9 and 10 by: 
                • promoting decentralised, renewable and 
low carbon energy (Policy WWE1); 
                • reducing ﬂood risk and implement 
appropriate coastal management (Policies WWE2 and WWE3); 
                • protecting the quantity and quality of 
surface water and groundwater bodies  and quality of bathing water (Policies WWE3 and WWE4); 
                • ensuring that development utilises the 
drainage hierarchy (Policy WWE5); 
                • encouraging and supporting the 
minimisation of waste production and the re-use and recovery of waste materials (Policy WWE6); 
                • focusing the development of new waste 
facilities on previously developed employment land (Policy WWE7); 
                • safeguarding existing waste facilities (Policy 
WWE8); and 
                • ensuring energy from waste facilities would 
not have signiﬁcant adverse impacts upon amenity (Policy WWE10).  
11.2 Implementing renewable and low carbon 
energy is an important part of the response  to the challenges of both climate change  and security of energy supply. Renewable  and low carbon energy sources are low or  zero emission alternatives to fossil fuels as  a source of energy. Renewable and low- carbon decentralised energy is an  important component of meeting carbon reduction targets.  
11.3 The purpose of the policy is to encourage the 
provision of renewable and low carbon energy through the planning system, but also to recognise the role of planning in setting the framework to allow assessment of potential impacts and to inﬂuence decision-making based on assessment. 
11.4 The development of most standalone 
renewable energy installations will require careful consideration due to their potential visual and landscape impacts, especially in areas of high landscape value. The size, location and design of renewable energy schemes should be informed by a Landscape Character Assessment, alongside other key environmental issues. 
11.5 The Sunderland Wind and Solar Landscape 
Sensitivity Assessment (2015) considers the sensitivity of different landscape character areas to potential wind turbine and solar development within the city and should form the basis of any assessments for these types of 
Policy  
WWE1 Decentralised, renewable and low 
carbon energy 
1. The development of decentralised, renewable 
and low carbon energy will be supported subject to satisfactory resolution of all site speciﬁc constraints as follows:  
i. decentralised, renewable and low-carbon 
energy development should be located and designed to avoid unacceptable signiﬁcant adverse impacts on landscape, wildlife, heritage assets and amenity; ii. appropriate steps should be taken to 
mitigate any unacceptable signiﬁcant adverse impacts, such as noise nuisance, ﬂood risk, shadow ﬂicker, interference with telecommunications, air trafﬁc operations, radar and air navigational installations through careful consideration of location, scale, design and other measures; and 
iii. any adverse cumulative impacts  
of proposals.  
2. Development that can provide combined heat 
and power must demonstrate that due consideration has been given to the provision of any heat produced as an energy source to any suitable adjacent potential heat customers. Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 11111. Water, waste and energydevelopment. The impact of any other 
proposals for decentralised, renewable and  low carbon energy development upon the landscape should be considered against  the Sunderland Landscape Character Assessment (2015).  
11.6 Signiﬁcant weight is given to the wider 
environmental, social and economic beneﬁts of renewable and low carbon energy generation and particularly, decentralised energy generation schemes. The impact on neighbouring residents and other sensitive receptors is also a signiﬁcant consideration,  but will vary, depending on the size, scale, location and type of technology proposed. Any potential cumulative impact of schemes within the area, including within and outside the city, will also be considered. 
11.7 The A&D Plan will identify locations suitable for 
wind energy development if appropriate.  
11.8 Applications for wind turbine installations will 
need to include details of associated infrastructure and connectivity, such as new access roads and overhead power lines, so that the council can fully assess the proposal.  
11.9 Flooding is a key factor in determining the 
scale and location of development in Sunderland. It is important that inappropriate development is avoided in areas currently at risk from ﬂooding, or likely to be at risk as a result of climate change, or in areas where development is likely to increase ﬂooding elsewhere. Inappropriate development in areas at risk of ﬂooding should be avoided by directing development away from areas at highest risk, but where it is necessary, without increasing ﬂood risk elsewhere. The National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG), together with the council’s latest Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA), Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) and latest Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (LFRMS) provides guidance in this respect. The SFRA provides a framework for the overall appraisal and management of risk. It allows the identiﬁcation of land with the lowest probability of ﬂooding that would be appropriate to the type of development or land use proposed. 
11.10 Development should be directed towards 
locations which are at lowest risk from ﬂooding. Where necessary, the applicant will be required to demonstrate that they have followed the sequential test. 
11.11 Developers must consider ﬂood risk from  
all sources as part of a SFRA and ensure they are utilising the most appropriate and up-to-date information in assessing the risk of  ﬂooding from all sources to the development site. Discussions should be held with the  Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) when 
Policy  
WWE2 Flood risk and coastal management 
1. To reduce ﬂood risk and ensure appropriate 
coastal management, development: 
i. should follow the sequential approach  
to determining the suitability of land  for development, directing new development to areas at the lowest risk of ﬂooding and where necessary applying the exception test, as outlined in national planning policy; 
ii. will be required to demonstrate, where 
necessary, through an appropriate Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) that development will not increase ﬂood risk on site or elsewhere, and if possible reduce the risk of ﬂooding;  
iii. will be required to include or contribute to 
ﬂood mitigation, compensation and/or protection measures, where necessary, to manage ﬂood risk associated with or caused by the development; iv. should comply with the Water  
Framework Directive by contributing  to the Northumbria River Basin Management Plan;  
v. will maintain linear coastal ﬂood defences 
north from Hendon Sea Wall to Seaburn, and managed coastal retreat on the Heritage Coast and north of Seaburn;  
vi. which would adversely affect the quantity 
of surface or groundwater ﬂow or ability to abstract water must demonstrate that no signiﬁcant adverse impact would occur, or mitigation can be put in place to minimise this impact; and 
vii. of additional river ﬂood defences must 
demonstrate that the proposal represents the most sustainable response to a particular threat.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 112considering measures to mitigate ﬂooding 
from different ﬂood sources within development proposals. Conditions or planning obligations will be used as appropriate to secure ﬂood risk mitigation measures. 
11.12 Sunderland falls within the Northumbria River 
Basin Management Plan (RBMP) which provides cross-boundary guidance on good practice and measures for improvement. Drawn up by the Environment Agency, RBMPs aim to provide integrated management of surface and groundwater bodies across individual regions. 
11.13 Built development can lead to increased 
surface water run-off; therefore new development is encouraged to incorporate mitigation techniques in its design, such as source control (interception) Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) and attenuation SuDS. Where appropriate, SuDS should be used as part of the linked Green Infrastructure Network to provide multiple functions and beneﬁts to landscape quality, recreation and biodiversity. This can be achieved through habitat creation, new open spaces and good design. SuDS should be designed to help cope with intense rainfall events as well as day-to-day rainfall events and to overcome any deterioration in water quality status. In determining the suitability of SuDS for individual development sites, developers should seek advice from the LLFA. 
11.14 In line with the Sunderland Corporation Act 
1972 and Shoreline Management Plan, coastal ﬂood defences will be maintained (termed “holding the line”) at Hendon Beach, the Port of Sunderland, Sunderland Harbour, Roker and Seaburn Beaches. ‘Managed retreat’ (which monitors the coastline’s natural processes  but with no active intervention) will be undertaken along the Heritage Coast to the south of Hendon as well as at South Bents  and Whitburn Cliffs. 
11.15 This policy should be read alongside the 
Marine Policy statement and the Marine Management Organisation’s developing North East Inshore and Offshore Plans. 
Policy  
WWE3 Water management  
Development must consider the effect on ﬂood 
risk, on-site and off-site, commensurate with the scale and impact. Development must: 
1. be accompanied by a Flood Risk Assessment 
(where appropriate), to demonstrate that the development, including the access, will be safe, without increasing or exacerbating ﬂood risk elsewhere and where possible will reduce ﬂood risk overall; 
2. demonstrate that they pass the Sequential 
Test and if necessary the Exceptions Test in Flood Zones 2 and 3; 
3. discharge at greenﬁeld run-off rates for the 1 in 
1 and 1 in 100 ﬂood events plus the relevant climate change allowance for greenﬁeld and brownﬁeld sites in accordance with the latest Local Flood Risk Management Strategy; 
4. incorporate a Sustainable Drainage System 
(SuDS) to manage surface water drainage. Where SuDS are provided, arrangements must be put in place for their whole life management and maintenance; 
5. separate, minimise and control surface water 
run-off by discharging in the following order: 
i. to an inﬁltration or soak away system; ii. to a watercourse (open or closed); iii. to a surface water sewer. However, if sites are within 250m of a tidal 
estuary or the sea, surface water can be discharged directly); 
6. ensure adequate protection where sites  
may be susceptible to over land ﬂood ﬂows  (as shown in the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment) or lie within a Surface Water Risk Area (as shown on the Environment Agency ﬂood maps); 
7. incorporate allowance for climate change in 
accordance with the latest Environment Agency Guidance;  
8. make developer contributions, where needed, 
to ensure that the drainage infrastructure can cope with the capacity needed to support proposed new development; 
9. demonstrate control of the quality of surface 
water run-off during construction and for the lifetime of the development. For all developments the management of water should be an intrinsic part of the overall development; and Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 113 
11.16 Flooding from sewers is increasingly 
recognised as an issue in areas that are not necessarily at risk from ﬂuvial ﬂooding – whereby rainfall events, sometimes away from the area concerned, cause major surface water run-off to enter the sewerage system. 
11.17 This policy seeks to minimise the risk that 
future development locations could be  ﬂooded from sewers or add to an existing  risk by ensuring that surface water run-off entering the sewer system is kept to an absolute minimum. Other beneﬁts of such an approach will include a much reduced risk to water quality. 
11.18 To help adapt to expected climate change, the 
policy provides the broad framework for addressing the increased risk of ﬂooding including a requirement for sustainable drainage systems. 
11.19 Where appropriate, SuDS should contribute  
to the provision of Green Infrastructure  whilst retaining acceptable levels of useable amenity space. 
11.20 In order to protect the Magnesian Limestone 
aquifer and its ground source protection zones, the use of deep inﬁltration SUDS and other inﬁltration SuDS will not be supported where they are likely to have an adverse impact on drinking water supply. Ground investigations would need to be considered on a case by case basis and should be guided by the Environment Agency’s approach to groundwater protection.  
11.21 This policy seeks to minimise the impact of 
development on the quality of surface water and the Magnesian Limestone aquifer and its ground source protection zones.  
11.22 The potential to pollute our groundwater 
aquifers is signiﬁcant. Intense rainfall can cause localised ﬂooding and erosion, and storm sewage overﬂows are known to affect water quality, environmental quality and affect important wildlife sites. Furthermore, old  mine workings within the city have the potential to release heavy metals into the groundwater aquifers, and in areas along the coast, over-pumping of the aquifer has resulted in saline intrusions. Increased use of fertilizers in the catchment by the agricultural industry is also resulting in increasing nitrite concentrations, and landﬁll sites also present a high risk to groundwater.10. not have a detrimental impact on the city’s 
water resources, including the Magnesian Limestone aquifer and its ground source protection zones. Development along the River Wear and coast should take account of the Northumbria River Basin Management Plan, to deliver continuing improvements in water quality.Policy  
WWE4 Water quality  
The quantity and quality of surface and 
groundwater bodies and quality of bathing water shall be protected and where possible enhanced in accordance with the Northumbria River Basin Management Plan.  
1. Water quality assessments will be required for: 
i. any physical modiﬁcations to a 
watercourse; and 
ii. any development which could indirectly, 
adversely affect water bodies. 
2. Development that discharges water into a 
watercourse will be required to incorporate appropriate water pollution control measures. 
3. Development that incorporates inﬁltration 
based SuDS will be required to incorporate appropriate water pollution control measures. 
4. Development adjacent to, over or in, a main 
river or ordinary watercourse should consider opportunities to improve the river environment and water quality by: 
i. naturalising watercourse channels; ii. improving the biodiversity and ecological 
connectivity of watercourses; 
iii. safeguarding and enlarging river buffers 
with appropriate habitat; and 
iv. mitigating diffuse agricultural and  
urban pollution.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 11411.23 The Environment Agency and the Coal 
Authority recommend a hydrogeological risk assessment is provided on the impact of development on the existing minewater ‘blocks’ (in terms of ﬂood risk and water quality) as identiﬁed by the Coal Authority. Further advice should be sought from the local planning authority. 
11.24 The council, in conjunction with the 
Environment Agency and the sewerage undertaker, will seek to resist development that threatens water quality and quantity, and will generally encourage initiatives that result in an improvement of water quality and the capacity of surface waters to support wildlife. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) became part of UK law in 2003 with the primary objectives of achieving good ecological status in water bodies, and providing protection for drinking water sources and protected sites (Habitats Directive Sites and Sites of Special Scientiﬁc Interest). These requirements are reﬂected in the Environment Agency’s Northumbria River Basin Management Plan, which covers the city area. 
11.25 Early engagement with the local planning 
authority, the LLFA, Environment Agency and relevant water and sewerage companies can help to establish if water quality is likely to be a signiﬁcant planning concern and, if it is, to clarify what assessment will be needed to support the application. Applicants should provide sufﬁcient information for the council to be able to identify the likely impacts on water quality. The information supplied should be proportionate to the nature and scale of the development proposed and the level of concern about water quality. 
11.26 Water quality at the designated bathing  
water sites at Roker and Seaburn is assessed by the Environment Agency. From May to September, weekly assessments measure current water quality, and at a number of sites daily pollution risk forecasts are issued. Both beaches have been rated as excellent for 2015, 2016 and 2017. 
11.27 For further information regarding the drainage 
hierarchy and use of non-main methods of drainage, advice should be sought from Northumbrian Water.  
Policy  
WWE5 Disposal of foul water 
1. Development should utilise the following 
drainage hierarchy: 
i. connection to a public sewer; ii. package sewage treatment plant (which 
can be offered to the Sewerage Undertaker for adoption); then 
iii. septic tank. 
2. Development involving the use of non-main 
methods of drainage in areas where public sewerage exists or the use of Cess Pits will not be permitted. 
3. Development of new or extensions/ 
improvements to existing waste water, sludge or sewage treatment works, will normally be supported unless the adverse impact of the development signiﬁcantly outweighs the need for greater capacity. 
4. Where the development involves the disposal 
of trade efﬂuent a foul Water Management Plan/drainage assessment will be required to demonstrate how the disposal of foul water is undertaken following the disposal hierarchy. This should include a trade efﬂuent consent if connected to the sewerage system. Trade efﬂuent is any liquid produced in the course of any trade or industry including car washes.
Policy  
WWE6 Waste management 
Development that encourages and supports the 
minimisation of waste production, and the re-use and recovery of waste materials including, for example, re-cycling, composting and Energy from Waste will normally be supported. Proposals for waste management facilities to deal with waste arisings will be encouraged based upon the following principles: 
1. managing waste through the waste hierarchy 
in sequential order. Sites for the disposal of waste will only be permitted where it meets a need which cannot be met by treatment higher in the waste hierarchy;Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 115  
Figure 45: Waste Hierarchy  
11.28 In line with Government guidance the Plan will, 
where necessary, make provision for the sustainable management of: non-hazardous waste, which consists of Local Authority Collected Waste (LACW) and Commercial and Industrial Waste; construction, demolition and excavation waste (CDEW); hazardous waste such as asbestos or batteries; low level radioactive waste; agricultural waste and waste water produced from water treatment. 
11.29 The council’s aim for waste management is to 
recycle 50% of waste from households by 2020, under the EU Waste Framework Directive and to recover 70% of construction and demolition waste by 2020. Therefore an adequate range of waste management facilities should be provided to ensure that waste is treated and disposed of in a sustainable and environmentally acceptable way, balancing the social and environmental needs of the city. Waste management facilities will need to have the potential to meet the Government’s waste management targets whilst taking into account potential spare capacity in adjacent local authority areas. 
11.30 Sunderland has progressed a joint approach to 
the procurement of waste services, along with the councils of South Tyneside and Gateshead, known as the “South Tyne and Wear Waste Management Partnership” (STWWMP). Guided by the joint waste strategy, the partnership has developed a longer-term strategic solution for the treatment and disposal of residual municipal waste. A contract has been secured for the city’s residual municipal waste to be treated at a new Energy from Waste Facility at Haverton Hill in Teesside.2. promoting the opportunities for on-site 
management of waste where it arises and encouraging co-location of waste developments that can use each other’s  waste materials; 
3. ensuring that sufﬁcient capacity is located 
within the city to accommodate forecast waste arisings of all types during the plan period, reducing the reliance on other authority areas; 
4. supporting delivery of the South Tyne  
and Wear Joint Municipal Waste  Management Strategy; 
5. facilitating the development of recycling 
facilities across the city including civic amenity sites and small recycling ‘bring’ banks to ensure there is sufﬁcient capacity and access for the deposit of municipal waste for re-use, recycling and disposal; 
6. facilitating the development of a network of 
small scale local waste management facilities in accessible locations, and effective methods of waste management such as suitable facilities to separate or store different types of waste, including materials that are required to be separated for kerbside collection schemes; 
7. ensuring new waste developments are located 
and designed to avoid unacceptable adverse impacts on landscape, wildlife, heritage assets and amenity; 
8. working collaboratively with neighbouring local 
authorities with responsibilities for waste and other local authorities where waste import/export relationships exist. This will ensure a co-operative cross boundary approach to waste management is established and maintained; and 
9. addressing to an acceptable standard the 
potential cumulative impacts of any waste development and the way it relates to  existing developments.PreventionStages Includes

Page 11611.31 The contract involved building an Energy from 
Waste facility which will burn the waste to create electricity. A new waste transfer facility station has also been granted consent and has been developed at Jack Crawford House depot, in Hendon. Both sites are now operational. 
11.32 The contract commenced April 2014 and will 
run for 23 years. It provides for three waste transfer stations, with some limited front end recycling of bulky waste with the majority of residual household waste transferred by bulk road haulage to a dedicated EFW facility at the Haverton Hill waste complex. The plant will be able to deal with up to 256,000 tonnes of waste each year and is capable of exporting 18.84MW of electricity to the national grid. The facility is supported by a Visitor and Education Centre at Gateshead’s waste transfer facility, which is located within Sunderland’s boundary at the Campground site in Springwell Village. 
11.33 Policy WWE6 puts in place the principles of 
identifying appropriate locations for waste management facilities. These principles are key to ensuring much needed waste management infrastructure is delivered in the most sustainable and effective way for the treatment of waste and the avoidance of potential negative impacts. 
11.34 Applicants will be expected to submit a 
supporting statement to demonstrate that the proposals would not have any unacceptable adverse impacts upon the landscape, wildlife, heritage assets and amenity. 
11.35 When considering the potential impacts of a 
scheme, applicants will also be expected to consider cumulative impacts and how the proposals may impact upon existing nearby land uses and/or other committed development proposals. Each application will be considered on a site by site basis. 
11.36 The A&D Plan will identify land to deliver this 
policy, where necessary. 
11.37 A Waste Needs Assessment (WNA) has been 
undertaken to review the existing operating capacity of waste infrastructure across Sunderland and to assess future requirements over the plan period. However, because the LACW contract is in place, this assessment has not sought to assess this waste stream as there are no anticipated requirements for managing residual waste. 
11.38 Applicants will be expected to demonstrate the 
need for the facility in terms of the type of facility and taking account of the capacity ﬁndings. To ensure waste management sites Policy  
WWE7 Waste facilities  
Development for new built waste facilities  
should be focused on previously developed employment land (excluding land within Primary Employment Sites) and will be required to meet the following criteria: 
1. demonstrate the need for the facility, if there is 
a clear conﬂict with other policies of the Development Plan; 
2. all waste processes and operations must be 
contained, processed and managed within buildings unless there are acceptable operational reasons why these processes cannot be contained within buildings; 
3. proposals must accord with all other policies  
in relation to the protection of the environment and public amenity or demonstrate that other material considerations outweigh any policy conﬂict;  
4. consideration will be given to the potential 
impacts of waste management proposals from: 
i. harmful materials entering the  
public highway; 
ii. generation of odours, litter, light, dusts, 
ﬂies, rodents, birds and other infestation; 
iii. noise, excessive trafﬁc and vibration; iv. risk of serious ﬁres through combustion of 
accumulated wastes; 
v. harm to water quality and resources and 
ﬂood risk management; 
vi. land instability;  vii. land use conﬂict; and viii. where necessary, mitigation measures 
should be identiﬁed to ameliorate any negative impacts to an acceptable level.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 117operate without detriment to amenity, public 
safety and without having a signiﬁcant adverse effect on the environment and appearance of the proposed development site, it is expected that proposals will be located within buildings, unless there are speciﬁc operational reasons why this is not possible. In such circumstances, the applicant will be expected to specify the activities which would take place outside of the building structure, quantify the impact of this activity on nearby sensitive receptors and provide a scheme of appropriate mitigation. 
11.39 When considering amenity issues, careful 
consideration should be given to potential cumulative impacts. 
11.40 Speciﬁc allocations, where necessary to meet 
identiﬁed requirements, will be made within the A&D Plan. 
 
11.41 There are a number of existing waste 
management facilities which help to manage all waste arisings within the city which remain an important function for the processing of waste materials. Table 10 identiﬁes the existing strategically important waste facilities for LACW only which are present within the city and are required to help deliver the Joint Municipal Waste Strategy.  
Table 10: Safeguarded Waste Facilities 
11.42 When determining applications for non-waste 
development within a distance that could affect the potential for waste use on a site, regard will be had to any potential adverse impact the proposed development might have on the future of the site as a location for waste management. If a development is likely to have an unacceptable impact on the future of the site as a location for waste management it will be refused, unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that there is no longer a need for the allocated site as a location for waste management or there is an overriding need for the non-waste development in that location. 
11.43 In addition to the sites listed in Table 10 and 
those speciﬁed in Appendix 10 of the Waste Arisings and Capacity Requirements report (2018), the following sites are also considered of importance to the management of LACW in Sunderland and for the delivery of the Joint Municipal Waste Strategy: 
                • H W Martens Waste Transfer Station, Teal 
Farm, Washington; 
                • G O’Brien and Son Waste Transfer Station, 
Wilden Road, Pattinson, Washington;Policy  
WWE8 Safeguarding waste facilities  
The council will safeguard all existing waste 
management sites within Sunderland from inappropriate development in order to maintain existing levels of waste management capacity and to aid delivery of the Joint Municipal Waste Strategy, including those sites identiﬁed within Table 10, as well as planned future replacement facilities for existing Household Waste Recycling Centres (HWRCs) and commercial facilities required for the management of LACW or other waste streams, unless it can be demonstrated that: 
1. there is no longer a need for the facility; and 
2. capacity can be met elsewhere; or 3. appropriate compensatory provision is made in 
appropriate locations elsewhere in the city; or 
4. the site is required to facilitate the strategic 
objectives of the city. 
Applications for non-waste development in close 
proximity to existing or proposed waste facilities will not normally be supported where they would adversely impact upon the use of the site for waste management operations. Facility name Facility type

11.44 In order to ensure that there is sufﬁcient 
capacity within the city to deal with waste arisings, other than those which are to be sent to the EFW plant at Haverton Hill, Policy WWE8 seeks to protect these facilities. However, it is recognised that in some circumstances there may no longer be a need for the facility. In such circumstances, the loss of waste management sites will be supported where the capacity can be met elsewhere, appropriate compensatory provision is made in appropriate locations elsewhere, or the site is required to facilitate the strategic objectives of the city. 
11.45 The purpose of this policy is to safeguard those 
sites required for the delivery of the Joint Municipal Waste Management Strategy and other strategically important sites to protect them against potential future conﬂict with incompatible uses, as well as protecting existing waste management infrastructure in Sunderland to ensure sufﬁcient capacity is maintained to manage expected levels of waste over the plan period. This is important because the predicted future need for additional waste management capacity assumes existing capacity is available (except where known closure has been identiﬁed within the plan period). Should the continuation or potential expansion of sites be affected by non-waste development this would impact on the ability of Sunderland to manage its waste. Policy HS1 of this Plan sets out the material planning considerations in this regard. 
11.46 It is also important to note that HWRCs are 
often located relatively near to residential areas to ensure they are accessible to the public for whom they are intended. NPPW states that the need to ensure that ‘waste management is considered alongside other spatial planning concerns, such as housing and transport, recognising the positive contribution that waste management can make to the development of sustainable communities’. This statement is clear that waste development needs should be considered alongside other development and the importance of the future need for waste facilities should be considered when determining non-waste applications. Policy  
WWE9 Open waste facilities  
1.  Development for new open waste 
management facilities will be permitted where: 
i. the waste site allocations and existing 
waste facilities are shown to be unsuitable and/or unavailable for the proposed development; 
ii. a need for the capacity of the proposed 
development has been demonstrated to manage waste arising from within the administrative area of Sunderland; and 
iii. it is demonstrated that the site is at least 
as suitable for such development as Site Allocations, with reference to the overall spatial strategy and site assessment methodology associated with the Development Plan. 
2. Where acceptable, proposals should be located 
at or on: 
i. redundant farm land (in the case of green 
waste and/or biological waste); or 
ii. demolition and construction sites, where 
the inert waste materials are to be used on the construction project on that site; or 
iii. existing permitted waste management 
sites or co-located with other waste management development; or 
iv. the curtilages of Waste Water Treatment 
Works (in the case of biological waste); or 
v. mineral and landﬁll sites where waste 
material is used in conjunction with restoration or proposed waste operations are temporary and linked to the completion of the mineral/landﬁll operation; or  
vi. areas of previously developed land; or vii. employment areas that are existing or 
allocated in the Development Plan for general industry (B2) and storage and distribution (B8), with the exception of Primary Employment Areas, the Port of Sunderland or the IAMP, where waste development will not be supported. 
3. Any proposals that come forward on land use 
types not identiﬁed above will be assessed on their merits, based on the other policies in the Development Plan. Such locations will be considered less favourably than those set out within this Policy.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 11911.47 Open waste management facilities are those 
that deal with waste in the open air. Open waste operations also include aggregate recycling facilities and open window composting. Open waste facilities can give  rise to speciﬁc impacts such as noise, dust  and odour which can inﬂuence where such development should take place. Therefore careful consideration needs to be taken  when dealing with planning applications for such developments.  
11.48 Applicants will be expected to demonstrate  
the need for the facility and proposals should only be supported where existing waste management facilities are incapable of  dealing with the proposed waste streams. Development should be focused on  previously developed sites and those in previous compatible uses, as set out in  Policy WWE9 above. 
 
11.49 Energy from waste development has the 
potential to have signiﬁcant adverse impacts upon the environment, public health and/or public amenity, if not directed to appropriate locations. The applicant will be expected to submit supporting evidence to demonstrate that proposals for energy from waste developments would not have unacceptable signiﬁcant adverse impacts. Where signiﬁcant adverse impacts are recognised, appropriate mitigation must be identiﬁed and implemented to ensure that proposals are acceptable.11.50 Energy from waste developments have the 
opportunity to provide combined heat and power to other nearby users. Applicants will be expected to generate and distribute combined heat and power, unless a clear justiﬁcation is provided to explain why this is not possible.
Policy  
WWE10 Energy from waste  
1. Energy from waste development, together 
with any ancillary buildings and infrastructure must demonstrate that they will have no unacceptable signiﬁcant adverse impacts that cannot be mitigated for, particularly with regard to the protection of the environment, public health and public amenity. 
2. Energy from Waste development will be 
required to provide combined heat and power unless it can be demonstrated that this would prevent the development of waste management facilities that have the potential to deliver important waste infrastructure. Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 12012.1 A strategic priority is to improve public 
transport and accessibility across our area, while reducing the adverse impact of road trafﬁc and trafﬁc congestion. The level of population and employment growth proposed over the next 18 years will necessitate increased investment in public transport to improve transport accessibility for all users, and the council will work with partners, transport operators and developers to ensure that this takes place. Focusing on sustainable transport development will not only improve accessibility but will also help to support other crucial initiatives in Sunderland such as helping to improve trafﬁc congestion, air quality, road safety and supporting increased levels of physical activity and overall health.  
12.2 The council will also seek to ensure that major 
new development is located in areas with high levels of public transport accessibility, thereby reducing the need to travel by private car, to minimise energy use and to increase opportunities for walking and cycling. 
12.3 This chapter seeks to address Strategic Priority 
11 and to improve transportation provision, accessibility and air quality by: 
                • ensuring development has no severe 
adverse impact on the local road network; is close to public transport links (or where new links could be provided); and enhances opportunities for walking and cycling (Policies ST1, ST2 and ST3); 
                • enhancing the transport network to 
improve connectivity from homes to employment areas, designated centres, and to other key trip generators (Policies SP10 and ST1); 
                • utilising trafﬁc management measures in 
order to manage congestion and mitigate against the environmental and health impacts of trafﬁc (Policies SP10 and HS1); 
                • ensuring that transport initiatives support 
the development of safer, cleaner and more inclusive centres and neighbourhoods (Policy ST1); and                • working with the North East Combined 
Authority (NECA), neighbouring councils and other partners to promote cross-boundary transport initiatives. 
12.4 Sustainable transport will be guided by  
the Local Transport Plan and NECA  including development of cross boundary transport initiatives. 
Strategic Policy  
SP10 Connectivity and transport network 
To improve connectivity and enhance the city’s 
transport network, the council, working with its partners and utilising developer contributions will seek to: 
1. deliver the following new highways schemes 
and initiatives: 
i. Sunderland Strategic Transport Corridor 
(remaining phases); 
ii. Ryhope to Doxford Park Link Road; iii. Central Route section of Coalﬁeld 
Regeneration Route; and 
iv. Improvements to the mainline and key 
junctions on the A19, including providing access to the IAMP; 
2. improve the following transport routes and bus 
corridors to encourage walking and cycling and to reduce congestion: 
i. A183 Chester Road; ii. A690 Durham Road; iii. A1231 Sunderland Highway  
(west of the A19); 
iv. A1018 Newcastle Road; v. B1522 Ryhope Road; vi. Washington Road/North Hylton Road 
(east of A19); and 
vii. A182 Houghton/Hetton Road. 
3. improve the operating conditions for buses, in 
particular through securing improvements to the major bus corridors identiﬁed above; and exploring park and ride opportunities; 
4. support improvements to the Metro and rail 
network including new stations and routes where deliverable; Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 12112. Sustainable transport 
12.5 Improving connectivity and the transport 
network is a key principle which will support the growth of the city. In order to facilitate this growth there will need to be improvements to the road network, public transport network and cycle network. 
12.6 A number of speciﬁc new highway schemes 
and initiatives have been identiﬁed to deliver this plan, including: 
                • the Sunderland Strategic Transport Corridor 
(SSTC) which will provide a high-quality route between the A19 and the Port, taking in the Urban Core as well as improving accessibility to development sites along the river corridor. Both the initial section of this road (St Mary’s Boulevard) and Phase 2 including the Northern Spire Bridge are complete. Further phases to follow include: 
                      – Phase 3 (South Bridgehead to St 
Michael’s Way); and 
                      – Phase 4 and 5 Commercial Links 
(Wessington Way and Port Access improvements). 
The delivery of SSTC4 will better manage trafﬁc 
to and from the A19 and assist in managing potential queuing on the Strategic Road Network (SRN) off slip roads at the Wessington Way junction. The council will continue to work with Highways England to deliver a junction improvement scheme at the Wessington Way junction with the A19. This scheme, along with the delivery of the full length of SSTC4, aim to control and manage trafﬁc ﬂow on the local road network, with the speciﬁc intention of helping to better manage trafﬁc ﬂow on the SRN. The council will also consider the delivery of new links on the local road network to mitigate capacity and safety concerns with the A19. Any proposals and delivery timescales will be agreed through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with both parties:                • the council is proposing a major area of 
housing growth, known as the SSGA (Policy SS6). The key transport infrastructure requirement needed to support the development of SSGA is the Ryhope-Doxford link road; 
                • the Central Route in the Coalﬁeld will link 
the A182 at Biddick Woods via Sedgeletch and Dubmire south to Rainton Bridge Industrial Estate. The road will support housing and employment regeneration and improve connectivity in the Coalﬁeld. Developer contributions will be sought to fund completion of this road; and  
                • key junctions on the A19 at Downhill, 
Ferryboat Lane and A690. The IAMP AAP Infrastructure Delivery Plan contains the road improvement works that are required to speciﬁcally support the IAMP. 
12.7 The existing highway network will continue to 
fulﬁl an important role in the future prosperity of Sunderland. Trafﬁc congestion on several strategic roads and junctions is a cause of delays, with consequent lost time for employees and other travellers and additional costs for bus operators. Initial schemes include, for example, major improvements to the A183 Chester Road corridor. Other major road corridors, as set out within Policy SP10 will be improved as ﬁnances and circumstances permit. Improvements to these corridors will include provision to improve public transport, walking, cycling and disabled access. 
12.8 The efﬁcient operation of both the local and 
SRN (A19 and A194(M)) is vital to support the growth and long term viability of the Sunderland economy whilst also limiting the environmental effect of excessive congestion and minimising road safety concerns. In conjunction with Highways England it is anticipated that in the future a number of key junctions on the SRN will require improvement by major schemes, notably the A19 junctions with the A1231, A183 and the A690. In addition, trafﬁc growth will result in trafﬁc constraints on the A19 itself and widening of some sections will also be required. Nevertheless, whilst supporting improvements to the SRN, highway infrastructure is important, managing existing and future commuting patterns and reducing congestion by improved public transport provision and implementation of more travel planning management 
5. safeguard the following disused railway 
alignments for future use: 
i) Leamside line; and ii) South Hylton to Penshaw; 
6. improve and extend the cycle network.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 122measures to reduce single car occupancy is 
essential. Working together, the council and Highways England will also, during the lifetime of the Plan, identify potential schemes to address capacity and road safety concerns on the SRN. 
12.9 The vast majority of public transport trips in 
Sunderland are made by bus and it is likely that this will continue into the future. The council will work with the bus operators and Nexus to improve operating conditions for buses on the bus corridors within the city as outlined in Policy SP10. 
12.10 The Metro (and the wider local rail system) is a 
signiﬁcant public transport asset for the city but the network will need to be expanded and updated to meet future needs. The council will work with Nexus and other stakeholders to secure improvements to the Metro and local rail network. Future expansion plans for the Metro and the local rail network are not known at this point and new route possibilities will also depend on the ﬂexibility of the new rolling stock chosen for the Metro.  
12.11 The former Leamside railway line provides 
opportunities for a range of railway uses including improving connectivity between Washington and Sunderland (by taking in the former Penshaw-Pallion line) and southwards into the Coalﬁeld area. The council will continue to work with its sub-regional partners and transport infrastructure stakeholders to investigate the potential of this line and will support proposals that beneﬁt the city. The council will ensure that the location and  design of new development does not conﬂict with the potential for the Leamside Line’s  re-instatement. 
12.12 Increasing the opportunities for accessible and 
safe walking and cycling in Sunderland will have a number of beneﬁts, ranging from improving people’s health, improving air quality and reducing trafﬁc congestion. As well as strategic walking and cycling routes, the council will seek local improvements, including convenient and safe walking routes.  
12.13 The city is crossed by a network of footpaths, 
national cycle ways and equestrian routes, partly as a result of former railway lines that have been successfully reclaimed in recent years. These ensure sustainable off-road networks providing access to many parts of the city and a variety of destinations. Further 
routes will be pursued that will help to form a grid pattern that enable longer or shorter circuits to be used for commuting or recreational purposes. 
 
12.14 In accordance with the NECA Transport 
Manifesto and emerging Transport Plan, the council is committed to improving accessibility to and movement within the Urban Core. 
12.15 Key improvements will involve avoiding 
conﬂicts between pedestrians and vehicular trafﬁc, making improvements to the physical infrastructure within the Urban Core such as Park Lane Station and the southern concourse of Sunderland Station and improving connectivity between the Urban Core and other major centres within the UK.  
12.16 The A&D Plan will identify land to deliver this 
policy, where necessary.
Policy  
ST1 Urban Core accessibility and movement  
Accessibility to and movement through the Urban 
Core will be enhanced by: 
1. discouraging the use of streets by through-
vehicular trafﬁc; 
2. increasing priority for pedestrians and cyclists 
in the Primary Shopping Area; 
3. improving the cycle network; 4. improving ‘legibility’ and signage for 
pedestrians; 
5. providing for operational access for businesses; 6. improving the provision of car parks around 
the ring road; 
7. reducing the ‘barrier’ effect of the ring road in 
relation to adjacent areas; 
8. improving the attractiveness of Park Lane 
Interchange; and 
9. working with rail industry partners to: 
i. improve the connectivity of Sunderland to 
other major centres; and 
ii. supporting redevelopment and 
improvement of Sunderland Station.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033

Figure 46: Local Road Hierarchy 
12.17 Whilst the Strategic Road Network is important 
in providing connections between Sunderland and the wider area, the vast majority of roads within Sunderland form part of the Local Road Network. Policy ST2 sets out the local road network hierarchy, which will be used when considering development. It will be ensured that the function of all roads within the Local Road Network are to be protected in accordance with their position within the road hierarchy to ensure the safe and efﬁcient movement of trafﬁc for all. 
12.18 Developers must demonstrate that proposals 
will not have a severe impact on the safe operation and management of the Local Road Network for all highway users. This will be subject to scoping and agreement with the Local Highway Authority. Policy  
ST2 Local road network 
1. The Local Road Network will be protected for 
safe and efﬁcient movement in accordance with the following road hierarchy: 
i. Distributor Roads; ii. Category 1 Roads; iii. Category 2A Roads; and iv. Category 3 Roads. 
2. To ensure that development has no 
unacceptable adverse impact on the Local Road Network, proposals must ensure that: 
i. where a new vehicular access is accepted 
in principle, the number of access points will be kept to a minimum and new access points will be designed and constructed in accordance with the current highway design standards; 
ii. they have safe and adequate means of 
access, egress and internal circulation/turning arrangements for all modes of transport relevant to the proposal; 
iii. where an existing access is to be used, 
substandard accesses will be improved and/or upgraded in accordance with the current standards for the category of road; 
iv. they are assessed and determined against 
current standards for the category of road having regard to the capacity, safety and geometry of the highway network; 
v. they have safe and convenient access for 
sustainable transport modes relevant to its location; and 
vi. they will not create a severe impact on 
the safe operation of the highway network; resulting in potential risk to all highway users with speciﬁc consideration given to vulnerable road users.DISTRIBUTOR ROAD

12.19 Development must be designed and 
constructed in accordance with Sunderland City Council Adoptable Highway Standards. Highway access and road layouts will need to be agreed with the Local Highway Authority to ensure a development does not cause signiﬁcant congestion or road safety issues.  
12.20 Development proposals impact upon the 
transport network as a result of additional trips being generated. It is therefore important that the potential impacts of development are understood and that any necessary improvements are identiﬁed prior to the development taking place and implemented  at an appropriate time during the proposed development. The scope of transport  evidence will need to be discussed and  agreed with the Local Highway Authority,  with speciﬁc requirements based on the scale of development. 
12.21 New developments must comply with the 
above requirements. Any variations to the above requirements or development-speciﬁc needs will be determined through pre-application discussions with the council.  This should be agreed on a site by site basis unless forming part of a wider Masterplan  with cumulative trafﬁc and transport implications. With respect to any development which could impact on the Strategic Road Network, Highways England would be required to be consulted. 
12.22 Transport Assessments/Transport Statements 
and Travel Plans will be required to support most planning applications, which is clariﬁed  in the council’s validation of planning applications checklist. Development proposals will be expected to provide any necessary mitigation works identiﬁed through the Transport Assessment or Transport Statement. 
Policy  
ST3 Development and transport  
Development should: 1. provide safe and convenient access for all road 
users, in a way which would not: 
i. compromise the free ﬂow of trafﬁc on the 
public highway, pedestrians or any other transport mode, including public transport and cycling; or 
ii. exacerbate trafﬁc congestion on the 
existing highway network or increase the risk of accidents or endanger the safety of road users including pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users; 
2. incorporate pedestrian and cycle routes within 
and through the site, linking to the wider sustainable transport network;3. submit an appropriate Transport 
Assessment/Transport Statement and a Travel Plan. This must demonstrate that appropriate mitigation measures can be delivered to ensure that there is no detrimental impact to the existing highway; 
4. include a level of vehicle parking and cycle 
storage for residential and non-residential development, in accordance with the council’s parking standards; 
5. provide an appropriate level of electric vehicle 
parking and charging infrastructure for commercial and non-residential development to suit site speciﬁc requirements, and make provision for the installation of home charging apparatus on major residential schemes; and 
6. safeguard the existing network of Deﬁnitive 
Public Rights of Way. If this cannot be accommodated, then a diversion and/or alternative route shall be provided.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 125The development proposals will need to 
comply with the council’s guidance on  parking standards for residential and non-residential development. 
12.23 Development will also need to provide an 
appropriate level of electric vehicle parking and charging infrastructure to suit development requirements. These are to be determined on a site by site basis and agreed with the council. Major residential schemes of 50 dwellings or more will be expected to make provision for the installation of home charging apparatus. 
12.24 The existing network of Deﬁnitive Public Rights 
of Way must be safeguarded where affected by development, ensuring that it remains protected and open for use by the public. Where Deﬁnitive Public Rights of way exist through a development site, it should be retained on its existing alignment and the development designed and laid out to accommodate it. In the event that there is no alternative and the development cannot accommodate the existing Deﬁnitive Public Right of Way, a diversion and/or alternative route shall be provided. Any such diversion and/or alternative must be approved as convenient and suitable in all respects by the council and will be constructed in accordance with current standards. 
12.25 A travel plan is a long-term management 
strategy for an organisation or site that seeks to deliver sustainable transport objectives through an action plan that is regularly reviewed. The travel plan should set targets, objectives and monitoring requirements. The travel plan should include a series of measures, management and funding details that aim to deliver the stated objectives and targets. The travel plan should be secured by a planning obligation and have regular ongoing management. A Transport Assessment will be required for any development where the council anticipates that the development will generate a level of trips that impact on the existing highways arrangement. In line with the PPG, the need for a Transport Assessment will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and will be at the discretion of the council. 
12.26 The council will require developer support for 
upgrades and improvements to capacity on public transport services and the associated infrastructure and facilities, through ﬁnancial contributions, where these improvements are necessary to enable the development to take 
place. The council will also expect that appropriate mitigation is provided by the developer for any impacts expected on the public highway or local network. 
12.27 Sufﬁcient car parking will need to be  
provided to meet the essential needs of developments. Parking space is often an inefﬁcient and unattractive use of land and its impact on local environmental quality should be minimised where car parking is provided in new developments. 
Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 12613.1 Minerals are an important resource and are an 
essential requirement to support sustainable economic growth. It is necessary that there is a sufﬁcient supply of minerals to provide the infrastructure, buildings, energy, and goods that an area needs. Where materials are not available locally, Sunderland will work with neighbouring authorities and other Mineral Planning Authorities to ensure that the continued need for aggragates can be met. Minerals are a ﬁnite resource and can only be worked where they are found, and therefore it is important to make the best use of them and to secure their long-term conservation. This chapter includes policies to meet Strategic Priority 12 and will support proposals for mineral development by: 
                • supporting minerals extraction, where the 
impacts of doing so would not be unacceptable (Policy SP11); 
                • protecting Minerals Safeguarding Areas and 
minerals infrastructure from non-mineral development (Policy M1); 
                • carefully controlling any proposals for 
surface coal extraction (Policy M2); 
                • ensuring development gives consideration 
to any land instability and minerals legacy issues (Policy M3); and 
                • requiring restoration and aftercare to 
improve the quality of the environment to at least the same standard as before mineral extraction took place (Policy M4).   
13.2 Policy SP11 sets out the approach for dealing 
with planning applications for mineral extraction, which should be considered in line with other relevant policies in this Plan. The policy focuses on the key criteria that will be used to judge applications. Proposals for mineral extraction (including extensions to existing sites), will be required to robustly justify the requirement for extraction, speciﬁcally in relation to the need for the site to maintain supply in line with the latest Local Aggregate Assessment, sub-regional apportionment ﬁgure and the maintenance of a landbank of at least 7 years for sand and gravel and at least 10 years for crushed rock. In order to protect against the potential risks of groundwater ﬂooding and protect water quality, proposals which involve dewatering will require a Water Management Plan. Any site speciﬁc allocations will be made through the Allocations and Designations Plan. 
13.3 The possibility of signiﬁcant environmental and 
social effects associated must be fully understood before consideration can be given as to whether the development is acceptable. The applicant will be expected to provide detailed information of the likely signiﬁcant effect of the development on human beings, ﬂora, fauna, soil, water, air, climate, landscape, material assets and cultural and historical heritage. Potential cumulative impacts must also be considered. The council encourage applicants to engage with local communities at an early stage when preparing development proposals and where appropriate, consider establishing liaison committees with representatives from the local communities.
Strategic Policy  
SP11 Mineral extraction 
1. Development for mineral extraction must 
demonstrate the extent, quality, signiﬁcance and need for the resources to be extracted and must ensure that: 
i. the natural and historic environment, 
highway safety and human health is conserved, managed and enhanced  as appropriate;ii. residential amenity and human health is 
protected from issues such as noise, vibration and air quality; 
iii. workings will not increase the potential of 
ﬂood risks or surface water ﬂooding;  
iv. essential infrastructure is protected; and v. the transportation of minerals makes use 
of sustainable modes of transport wherever possible.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 12713. Minerals13.4 There is currently no evidenced demand for 
the extraction of hydrocarbons such as the hydraulic fracturing of shale rocks for oil and gas within the city and no Petroleum Exploration and Development Licenses (PEDL) have been granted. It is therefore not considered necessary to provide speciﬁc policy coverage for this within the Plan. Any proposals will be determined in accordance with the relevant national policy and guidance.  
13.5 Sunderland has a limited supply of mineral 
resources; therefore it is necessary to safeguard known minerals resources from other development that could sterilise their eventual extraction. However, it is a Government requirement that proven resources are not needlessly sterilised by non-mineral development, and that there should be prior extraction of the mineral if it is necessary for such development to take place. 
13.6 Sunderland’s Minerals Safeguarding Areas 
(MSAs) have been developed in accordance with guidance published by the British Geological Survey and by using mineral resource information provided by the British Geological Survey and the Coal Authority. It is also a requirement to safeguard existing, planned and potential mineral infrastructure such as rail heads, wharfs, depots, coating and batching plants. The MSAs and safeguarded infrastructure are shown on the Policies Map and are identiﬁed in Appendix 4. 
13.7 With regard to development proposals within 
Coal MSAs, where it can be accommodated in an environmentally acceptable manner, and provided that the proposed development is not prejudiced or delayed signiﬁcantly, coal resources should be extracted prior to development commencing. In order to avoid Policy

incompatible non-mineral development within a Minerals Safeguarding Area, as deﬁned on the Policies Map (Appendix 4), where it is demonstrated that either: 
i. the mineral is not of economic value or 
potential value, or does not exist; or 
ii. that extraction of the mineral would not 
be physically viable or practicable; or 
iii. the mineral can be extracted satisfactorily, 
having regard to Policy SP11, prior to the non-minerals development taking place without adversely affecting the viability or deliverability of the non-minerals development; or 
iv. the incompatible development is of a 
temporary nature that can be completed and the site returned to a condition that would not prevent future mineral extraction; or 
v. material considerations indicate that the 
need for the development overrides the presumption for mineral safeguarding such that sterilisation of the mineral can be permitted following the exploration of opportunities for prior extraction; or 
vi. it constitutes development that is exempt 
from the mineral safeguarding policy (see the list of exempt criteria in Appendix 4). 
2. Planning permission will only be granted for 
development that is incompatible with safeguarded minerals management, transportation or waste management facilities, where it is demonstrated that either: 
i. it constitutes exempt development as set 
out in Appendix 5; or ii. replacement capacity, of the similar type, 
is available at a suitable alternative site, which is at least equivalent or better than that offered by the facility that it is replacing; or 
iii. it is for a temporary period and will not 
compromise its potential in the future for minerals transportation; or 
iv. material considerations indicate that the 
need for development overrides the presumption for safeguarding; or 
v. it has been demonstrated that the 
capacity of the facility to be lost, is not required. 
3. Planning applications for development within 
100m of safeguarded facilities need to demonstrate that impacts, e.g. noise, dust, light and air emissions, that may legitimately arise from the activities taking place at the safeguarded sites would not be experienced to an unacceptable level by occupants of the proposed development and that vehicle access to and from the facility would not be constrained by the development proposed.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 128potential problems of delay, any potential 
surface coal working should be included in an overall programme for the development. 
 
13.8 Surface coal extraction is a particularly intrusive 
method for accessing and utilising it as a resource. The council will therefore carefully consider the potential adverse impacts associated with surface coal extraction, when considering any such planning application. 
13.9 Applicants will be expected to submit detailed 
supporting evidence as part of any application for surface coal extraction to clearly demonstrate that the policy requirements have been satisﬁed. 
 
13.10 Mineral extraction has been one of the most 
signiﬁcant activities shaping the development of the city over the past two centuries. Consequently, there are approximately 290 recorded mine entries listed in the city, potentially resulting in land instability. 
13.11 Whilst land instability is not a complete 
constraint on development, careful consideration needs to be given to its potential impacts as part of the determination  
of planning applications in areas with a  mining legacy. 
13.12 For development sites within the Coal 
Authority’s most up-to-date ‘Development High Risk Areas’, developers will be required  to prepare a Coal Mining Risk Assessment and/or carry out site investigations and  submit this alongside the planning application, unless the planning application type or  nature of proposed development is included within the Coal Authority’s most up-to-date  list of exemptions. 
 
13.13 The nature of restoration activity depends on 
the choice of after-use, which is inﬂuenced by a variety of factors including the aspirations of the landowner(s) and the local community, the present characteristics of the site and its environs, any strategies for the area (e.g. biodiversity priorities), the nature, scale and duration of the proposed development and the availability and quality of soil resources. 
13.14 Where the development is to restore the site 
to agricultural use at existing ground levels, ensuring the availability of clean inert ﬁll material is important to the deliverability of the scheme, as is the availability of suitable topsoil. Quarries have been restored through importation of non-hazardous and/or hazardous waste and the acceptability of this in principle would be considered against Policy M4. It may be appropriate to retain some industrial archaeological features, geological exposures or landscapes within a quarry.  Policy  
M2 Surface coal extraction  
The extraction of surface coal will only be 
acceptable where: 
1. the proposal is environmentally acceptable, or 
can be made so through agreed mitigation or through planning conditions or legal obligations; or 
2. the proposal can provide national, local or 
community beneﬁts which clearly outweigh the likely adverse impacts to justify the granting of planning permission; and 
3. the applicant can satisfy the criteria set out 
within Policy SP11.
Policy  
M3 Land instability and minerals legacy 
1. Development should give consideration to 
hazards arising from past coal mining, in particular land instability and mine gas. 
2. Where a development is located within an area 
with a mining legacy, an applicant will be required to prepare and submit a Coal Mining Risk Assessment and/or carry out site investigations, as necessary.Policy  
M4 Restoration and aftercare  
1. Development for minerals extraction and 
temporary waste management facilities will be granted where satisfactory provision has been made for high standards of restoration and aftercare such that the intended after-use of the site is achieved in a timely manner, including where necessary for its long-term management, including the management, treatment and monitoring of surface water, leachates, ground waste landﬁll gases, engineering containment systems below and above ground in compliance with the relevant waste permit to deposit waste. 
2. Restoration plans should be submitted with 
the planning application which reﬂect the proposed after-use.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 12913.15 Restoration, aftercare and after-use will usually 
seek to assure that the land is restored back to a quality that is at a level at least equivalent to that which it was prior to development commencing and wherever possible, provide for the enhancement of the quality of the landscape, local environment or the setting of historic assets to the beneﬁt of the local or wider community. Wherever possible, restoration schemes should include measures to improve biodiversity interests whatever the proposed after-use of the site. Restoration, aftercare and after-use may be secured through planning conditions. 
13.16 Appendix 6 sets out the issues which should 
be addressed through restoration.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 130Implementation14.1 Having set out a clear direction how 
Sunderland will develop and the planning policies and proposals that will help achieve this, it will be important that there are tools in place to help implement these policies and ensure the successful delivery of the overall vision for this Plan. This chapter will seek to deliver Strategic Priority 13 by: 
                • Ensuring that development contributes to 
the timely delivery of any necessary infrastructure (Policy ID1); and 
                • Securing Section 106 planning obligations 
to fund any necessary infrastructure  (Policy ID2) 
14.2 While the council has a key role to play in 
delivering the policies and proposals, responsibility does not rest solely with the council and it will require the combined efforts and investment of a range of partners. The successful implementation will require a wide range of organisations to work together. The council will have a vital role in coordinating the actions and activities of these partners. 
14.3 Appendix 7 includes a table which provides a 
summary of the key mechanisms that will be used to support each policy’s implementation.  
14.4 Over the lifetime of this Plan it is likely that new 
initiatives, partnerships and sources of funding will emerge that will play a new role in helping to implement proposals and deliver growth. 
14.5 Sunderland’s future growth and environmental 
sustainability cannot be achieved without a wide array of essential infrastructure. The council will work with its partners to ensure that much needed infrastructure, including community facilities and services are provided for local communities.  
14.6 The term infrastructure can be taken to 
include roads and other transport facilities, ﬂood defences, schools and other educational facilities, health facilities, sporting and recreational facilities and open spaces. This is not an exhaustive list and there may be a range of other services and facilities that could constitute infrastructure, which will be required to deliver this Plan.  14.7 This Plan is supported by an Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan (IDP) which provides detail of the infrastructure that is essentially necessary to enable growth to occur and delivery issues in relation to key proposals. The IDP also includes a number of infrastructure projects, which although not essential to the delivery of this Plan, are desirable. Their inclusion within the IDP will assist the council in its attempts to secure funding for these projects. The council will keep these documents under review to measure progress. It should be noted that the IDP principally identiﬁes high level strategic infrastructure and does not include site speciﬁc infrastructure requirements, which will be dealt with through individual planning applications. 
14.8 This Plan has been developed alongside 
continued consultation with the bodies responsible for infrastructure delivery in order to ensure that essential infrastructure will be delivered in a timely manner, where appropriate. The views of these bodies have been used in testing and underpinning the strategy, although there remain some areas, which will require on-going consultation with the responsible bodies and agencies to identify future, unforeseen needs. 
 
14.9 Where necessary, the timing of provision of 
infrastructure will be linked directly to the phasing of development, taking account of viability. This will be secured either through planning conditions, or where this is not appropriate, by planning obligations or other 
Policy  
ID1 Delivering infrastructure  
1. Development will be expected to provide, or 
contribute towards the provision of: 
i. measures to directly mitigate the impacts 
of the development and make it acceptable in planning terms; and  
ii. contribute towards the delivery of 
essential infrastructure identiﬁed in the IDP. 
2. The timing and prioritisation in the delivery of 
essential infrastructure will accord with the priority needs established through the IDP.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 13314. Infrastructure and deliverysimilar infrastructure tariffs in accordance with 
the planning obligation tests set out in parpagraph 14.11, to ensure that the planned and necessary infrastructure is available to serve the development when it is ﬁrst required. The cumulative impact of developments will be taken into account.  
 
14.10 Where it is not possible to address any 
unacceptable impacts of development through planning conditions, the use of planning obligations will be considered to mitigate and/or compensate these impacts. 
14.11 Planning obligations must be: 
                • necessary to make the development 
acceptable in planning terms;  
                • directly related to the development; and                  • fairly and reasonably related in scale and 
kind to the development. 
14.12 The council will seek to secure fair and 
reasonable developer contributions that are proportionate to the development proposed, without adversely affecting the viability of development. Examples of requirements which may be needed to make a development acceptable include: 
                • provision of physical infrastructure; 
whether; transport, education, health, sport and leisure, waste collection and recycling and cultural and community provision;                • local public realm improvements including 
streetscape, local public open space,  green infrastructure, play facilities and community safety; 
                • sustainable mitigation and/or 
compensation and enhancements for priority species and habitats; 
                • mitigation of impacts on and/or 
enhancement of heritage assets or to compensate for their loss; and 
                • transport improvement including highways 
and trafﬁc works; local walking and cycling improvements and public transport provision.  
14.13 It is recognised that some development 
proposals may be unable to meet all of the relevant policy and planning obligation requirements while remaining  economically viable and deliverable, either  in whole or in part. 
14.14 In such circumstances the council will consider 
requests to reduce the level of planning obligations to a level which ensures that a scheme remains viable. The council will, where possible, work with applicants to prevent planned developments stalling. 
14.15 In these instances, preference will be given  
to the needs and priorities of an area and  the wider beneﬁts of development, such as,  for example, regeneration and meeting housing need. 
14.16 The Planning Obligations SPD provides greater 
detail on when planning obligations will be sought, how this will be calculated and give further details on viability. 
Implementation and Monitoring 
14.17 The successful implementation of the Local 
Plan relies on a coherent, robust and ﬂexible monitoring process which will enable the council to respond to changing circumstances. The principal mechanism for monitoring the performance of the Local Plan will be through the Authority’s Monitoring Report (AMR). The Localism Act 2011 requires Local Authorities to prepare AMRs to assess the implementation of the Local Development Scheme (LDS), and the extent to which policies and proposals set out in local development documents are being successfully implemented. Policy  
ID2 Planning obligations  
1. Section 106 planning obligations will be 
sought to facilitate the delivery of: 
i. affordable housing (see Policy H2); and ii. local improvements to mitigate the  
direct or cumulative impact of development, where evidenced, and/or additional facilities and requirements made necessary by the development,  in accordance with the Planning Obligations SPD.  
Where it is not possible to deliver the policy 
requirements in full, a viability assessment  should be submitted in line with the requirements of the PPG. Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033
Page 13414.18 The Implementation and Monitoring 
Framework is set out in the CSDP Monitoring Framework (2018). The Framework is structured according to the composition of the CSDP, enabling for easy and direct comparison with the policies, proposals and overall objectives. The implementation of the Local Plan will be monitored through a schedule of Monitoring Indicators on an annual basis. These will provide an accurate indication of the performance of the Local Plan against the objectives and the Local Plan policies. Through the monitoring process, the AMR will identify any issues that need to be rectiﬁed. 
14.19 There are several key triggers identiﬁed 
throughout the CSDP which would lead to a partial or full review of the Local Plan
23. Further 
set out in the Monitoring Framework (2018) are speciﬁc triggers for each Policy. This approach ensures that appropriate and proportionate triggers and actions can be set for each Policy and Monitoring Indicator due to a failure to meet key targets.

Monitoring Framework
Implementation and Monitoring 
Framework 
8.1 The Implementation and Monitoring 
Framework for the CSDP is set out in the section below. The Framework links directly to wider Local Plan, the Sustainability Appraisal (SA) and the 
Authority Monitoring Report 
(AMR) 
8.2 The Framework is structured according to the 
composition of the CSDP, enabling for easy and direct comparison with the policies, proposals and overall objectives. As the plan period runs until 2033, and given the long-term aspiration and objectives of the overall strategy, it is likely that this framework will evolve and change over time, particularly in light of any new requirements over this timeframe. Therefore, this Framework will  also be subject to a process of monitoring, review and amendment as part of the wider Local Plan. Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033

Mitigation 
Efforts to reduce or prevent the impact of an action. 
Mitigation hierarchy 
Involves doing everything possible to ﬁrst avoid and then minimise impacts of development on biodiversity. Only as a last resort and in agreement with the Council, compensate for losses that cannot be avoided. If compensating for losses within the development footprint is not possible or does not generate the most beneﬁts for nature conservation, then offset biodiversity losses by gains elsewhere. National Planning Policy Framework 
The framework acts as guidance for local planning authorities and decision-takers, both in drawing up plans and making decisions about planning applications. 
N2K or Natura 2000 Sites

The assessment includes the likely cumulative effect of recent permissions, developments under construction and completed developments. 
River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) 
Sunderland falls within the Northumbria River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) which provides cross-boundary guidance on good practice and measures for improvement. Drawn up by the Environment Agency and updated every 6 years, RBMPs aim to provide integrated management of surface and groundwater bodies across individual regions. 
Rural exception sites 
Small sites used for affordable housing in perpetuity where sites would not normally be used for housing.

References to town centres or centres apply to city centres, town centres, district centres and local centres but exclude small parades of shops of purely neighbourhood signiﬁcance. 
Transport Assessment 
A comprehensive and systematic process that sets out transport issues relating to a proposed development. It identiﬁes what measures will be required to improve accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for alternatives to the car such as walking, cycling and public transport and what measures will need to be taken to deal with the anticipated transport impacts of the development.Core Strategy and Development Plan 2015-2033

Waste hierarchy 
A framework that has become a cornerstone of sustainable waste management, setting out the order in which options for waste management should be considered based on environmental impact. 
Water Framework Directive (WFD) 
The Water Framework Directive (WFD) became part  of UK law in 2003 with the primary objectives of achieving good ecological status in water bodies and providing protection for drinking water sources and protected sites (Habitats Directive Sites and Sites of Speciﬁc Scientiﬁc Interest).
