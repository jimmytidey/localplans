 Foreword  
Since our Core Strategy was adopted in 2010, planning policy has undergone some 
significant changes as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). As 
such, we need to ensure our plans are fit for purpose and conform to national 
planning policy. The new Local Plan will be our strat egic plan for development for the 
Lake District up to 2035.  
Our aim has been to produce a planning framework that delivers the homes, 
communities and countryside that the Lake District wants and needs. We want to 
deliver our vision for the Lake District to  be ‘an inspirational example of sustainable 
development in action’.  
The Lake District received its inscription as a World Heritage Site in July 2017. We 
want World Heritage Status to be a positive force to support new investment in the 
Lake District’s cul tural and natural environment, its communities, farmers and 
economies.  
One of our key challenges is to enable growth to provide housing and jobs whilst 
conserving the landscape and its Special Qualities and attributes of Outstanding 
Universal Value. This m ust be achieved in the context of moving to a Net Zero 
Carbon Lake District and increasing our resilience to climate change. We have 
gathered evidence and listened to our communities, businesses and stakeholders to 
find out what the key issues are in the L ake District and how we can use this plan to 
deliver those aspirations.  
This Plan is a result of consultation and engagement with our communities, farmers, 
businesses, organisations and stakeholders. We hope the result of this provides our 
communities and stakeholders with the certainty about what we are trying to achieve 
and why.

 1 Introduction  
What is the Local Plan?  
[1.1.01] The Local Plan 2020 to 2035 sets out the strategy for all new development in 
the Lake District. It provides a practical framework within which decisions on 
planning applications can be made with a high degree of predictability and efficiency. 
Local Plans are where some of the big decisions on planning for the future of our 
communities and use of land are made.  
What is the purpose of the Local Plan?  
[1.1.02] The Local Plan provides planning policies which steer development 
decisions and guide planning applications. This Plan sets out the strategic policies 
we consider necessary to address the strategic priorities within the Lake District. 
These do not extend to detailed matters that are more appropriately dealt with 
through neighbourhood plans. As well as providing guidance to assess day to day 
planning applications, it also identifies where and how many new homes should be 
built, the locations where businesses need more land to expand or to create new 
jobs and which areas should be protected from development.  
How have we produced the Local Plan?  
[1.1.03] We have produced the Local Plan in cooperation with a variety  of 
stakeholders and in alignment with our Statement of Community Involvement. We 
have assessed future needs and opportunities within the Lake District, considered a 
number of options for addressing these needs and opportunities, and identified our 
suggest ed approaches. This has involved collecting and analysing evidence, 
understanding the main issues and discussing these with local communities, 
businesses and other interested parties.  
[1.1.04] We commissioned an independent Sustainability Appraisal (SA) an d Habitat 
Regulations Assessment (HRA) on the Options and Suggested Approach Document, 
and Published Local Plan. This also includes a Marine Conservation Zone 
Assessment.  
[1.1.05] We have produced Supplementary Planning Documents which provide 
further guid ance on how to implement Policy 04: Biodiversity and geodiversity, Policy 
05: Protecting the spectacular landscape, and Policy 15: Housing. These can be 
accessed on our website www.lakedistrict.gov.u k/localplan . 
National Park Authorities as Planning Authorities  
[1.1.06] Under the Environment Act 1995, the National Park Authority is the sole 
local planning authority for the Lake District, including the functions for Minerals and 
Waste. We must use these planning functions to further the National Park purposes 
and duty.  
  
 6 
 [1.1.07] Planning law requires that applications for planning permission be 
determined in accordance with the development plan, which includes local and 
neighbourhood plans, unless  material considerations indicate otherwise. The 
National Planning Policy Framework is a material consideration in planning 
decisions. For National Parks the English National Parks and the Broads – UK 
Government Vision and Circular 2010 is also relevant, p roviding updated policy 
guidance on a variety of themes, in particular, the Governments position on the 
delivery of housing in National Parks.  
Status of the Local Plan  
[1.1.08] On adoption, the Local Plan 2020 to 2035 becomes the Development Plan 
for the L ake District and replaces (See Appendix 2 for details) the following Local     
Plan documents:  
– Local Plan Part One – Core Strategy (October 2010)  
– Local Plan Part Two – Allocations of Land (November 2013)  
– Local Plan Part Three – Minerals Safeguarding Areas (November 2013)  
– Saved 1998 Local Plan Policies  
The Lake District — Spatial Portrait  
[1.1.09] Designated in 1951, the Lake District is a mountainous region in North West 
England of some 2,362 sq. kilometres. As well as being the largest National Par k in 
England, it has a resident population of approximately 40,297 (2017) making it the 
second most populated National Park in England. Its boundary extends across parts 
of Eden, Allerdale, Copeland and South Lakeland districts and it encompasses 82 
parish es. It is bounded by the M6 and A6 to the east. The A66 and A590 run through 
the northern and southern areas respectively. It has some of the country’s finest 
upland scenery which attracts approximately 19 million visitors each year, making 
tourism a major  industry.  It was awarded World Heritage Site inscription in 2017.  
The Purposes and Duty of National Parks  
[1.1.10] The purposes of National Park designation were first established in the 1949 
National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. The Environme nt Act 1995 
revised the original legislation and set out two statutory purposes:  
– Conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage  
– Promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special 
qualities of national par ks by the public  
In pursuing the statutory purposes, National Park Authorities also have a duty to:  
– Seek to foster the economic and social well -being of local communities 
within the national park  7 
 [1.1.11] Within the Lake District there are many different  interests to manage. 
Protection of the spectacular landscape, delivering economic prosperity, enhancing 
vibrant and resilient communities and enabling world class tourism – the challenges 
and opportunities are endless. And it is widely acknowledged that t he Lake District is 
a living, man -made cultural landscape that has evolved over time and needs to 
continue evolving to sustain its future.  
[1.1.12 ] Section 11A of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 
(amended by Section 62 of the Envi ronment Act 1995) makes clear that if National 
Park purposes are in conflict then conserving and enhancing the natural beauty, 
wildlife and cultural heritage of the area must have priority. This Section of the Act 
enshrines in law the Sandford Committee’s recommendations, commonly known as 
the ‘Sandford Principle’.  It is also made clear in the Act that this applies to all 
relevant authorities such as statutory undertakers and local authorities:  
In exercising or performing any functions in relation to, or so as to affect, land in a 
National Park, any relevant authority shall have regard to the purposes… and, if it 
appears that there is a conflict between those purposes, shall attach greater weight 
to the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beaut y, wildlife and cultural 
heritage of the area comprised in the National Park.  
[1.1.13 ] We will encourage and support development that is sustainable in the 
context of the Lake District and national planning policy on the  presumption in favour 
of sustainabl e development. We have prepared this Plan to enable this to take place. 
Taken as a whole the Plan’s policies and principles of development outline what we 
consider to be sustainable development in the Lake District context but we recognise 
that this may ch ange over time and therefore commit to a regular review of the Plan 
in line with the National Planning Policy Framework.

 2 Our Vision and Strategic Objectives  
 
 [2.1.01] We  believe that fundamental to our ability to manage the Lake District is 
that we have a clear Vision for how we ultimately want the place to be. The Vision 
and Vision Outcomes were agreed by the Lake District National Park Partnership in 
2006, and were revi ewed as part of the preparation of the Lake District National Park 
Partnership’s Plan 2015 –2020. In order to deliver our collective vision our strategic 
objectives all relate to delivery of this Vision. The Strategic Objectives for the Local 
Plan are prese nted as “specifically this means” and the “cross cutting objectives”.  
 
The 2030 Vision for the English Lake District is that it will be:  
An inspirational example of sustainable development in action.  
A place where its prosperous economy, world class visito r experiences and vibrant 
communities come together to sustain the spectacular landscape, its wildlife and 
cultural heritage.  
Local people, visitors, and the many organisations working in the Lake District or 
have a contribution to make to it, must be unit ed in achieving this.  
 
The 2030 Vision for the English Lake District is that it will be an inspirational example 
of sustainable development in action – see our four headings below and how they 
link to our Strategic Objectives:  
A prosperous economy  
We will see the following Vision outcome:  
Businesses will locate in the National Park because they value the quality of 
opportunity, environment and lifestyle it offers – many will draw on a strong 
connection to the landscape. Entrepreneurial spirit will be nurtur ed across all sectors 
and traditional industries maintained to ensure a diverse economy.  
Specifically this means:  
- A diverse and growing economy, supporting higher paid jobs, utilising a range of 
employment spaces that provide a choice of employment oppor tunities for everyone.  
- Profitable and sustainable land management, farming, and forestry industries.  
- The Lake District is a year round destination with more longer staying visitors 
supporting the economy.  
Vibrant communities  
We will see the following V ision outcome:  10 
 People successfully living, working and relaxing within upland, valley and lakeside 
places where distinctive local character is maintained and celebrated.  
Specifically this means:  
- A balanced and resilient housing market with a high proport ion of properties in 
permanent occupation, and a supply of new homes that meet local people’s needs 
and maximises the delivery of affordable housing.  
- Community and cultural facilities and local services are sustained, and communities 
have improved avail ability and access to well paid jobs, high quality greenspaces, 
recreation facilities and the countryside.  
World Class Visitor Experience  
We will see the following Vision outcome:  
High quality and unique experiences for visitors within a stunning and globa lly 
significant landscape. Experiences that compete with the best in the international 
market.  
Specifically this means:  
- Changing visitor expectations are met by a diverse range of quality 
accommodation.  
- Every visitor has the best experience that the La ke District offers through improved 
attractions, high quality public realm and amenities, and accessible visitor 
information; in turn appreciation and understanding of the Lake District is enhanced.  
Spectacular landscape, wildlife and cultural heritage  
We will see the following Vision outcome:  
A landscape which provides an irreplaceable source of inspiration, whose benefits to 
people and wildlife are valued and improved. A landscape whose natural and cultural 
resources are assets to be managed and used wise ly for future generations.  
Specifically this means:  
- The extraordinary beauty and harmony of the Lake District landscape and its 
Special Qualities and attributes of Outstanding Universal value are conserved and 
enhanced.  
- Design is inspired by and contri butes to local distinctiveness, and natural resources 
and cultural heritage assets are conserved, enhanced, utilised, and managed.  
- Bigger, better and more joined up resilient habitats support wildlife and species, 
and the function of ecosystems are impro ved whilst the evolution of the cultural 
landscape is respected.  
Strategic Objectives cross cutting themes  11 
 Health and Wellbeing  
An important contribution to the nation’s wellbeing is made by opportunities in the 
Lake District as people benefit physically a nd mentally.  
Connectivity and Infrastructure  
People and businesses have complete coverage of digital infrastructure in every 
valley.  
People move easily between destinations utilising enhanced, integrated, and 
sustainable transport services and infrastructu re, travel and orientation information, 
delivering a better choice of attractive travel options.  
World Heritage and local character  
Distinctiveness of place and individual character of valleys is recognised, and 
reflected by the character and form of new development, enabling the appropriate 
evolution and benefits befitting a National Park and World Heritage Site.  
Climate Change and Resilience  
Resilience to climate change and extreme weather events is improved by greater 
adaptation and mitigation. Improved  energy efficiency, local scale energy generation, 
improved sustainable travel options, and reducing the need to travel reduce the Lake 
District’s Carbon Budget and mitigate predicted effects of climate change.  
Special Qualities and Outstanding Universal V alue of the Lake District  
[2.1.02] Special Qualities distinguish National Parks from each other and other areas 
of the country. All of the Special Qualities of the Lake District contribute in different 
ways to the Outstanding Universal Value of the area re cognised by World Heritage 
Site Status. As this is the case all of the attributes of Outstanding Universal Value 
are specific aspects of each of the Special Qualities. This is demonstrated in Table 
1. Full descriptions of the Special Qualities are found in  the Partnership’s  Plan 2015 -
2020, and the attributes of Outstanding Universal Value for each valley can be found 
in the Nomination of the English Lake District: Volume 1 Nomination Document.

Climate Change  
[2.1.03] Climate change is already having a direct impact upon what the Lake District 
looks like and how its environment, society, and economy will  function in the future. 
Our strategic response to the risks that climate change presents to the Vision, 
Special Qualities and attributes of Outstanding Universal Value must be holistic, 13 
 rather than limited to a single strategy. Therefore we have addressed  climate change 
through a number of our policies in this document including ‘Principles of 
development’, ‘Development and flooding’, ‘Biodiversity and geodiversity ’, ‘Design 
and development’, ‘Lakeshore development’, ‘West Distinctive Area’ (in relation t o 
Coast) and ‘Renewable and low carbon energy’.

 3 The Strategic Policies  
National and international significance of the Lake District  
 
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.01.01] We want to conserve and enhance the extraordinary harmony and beauty 
of the Lake District landscape, its Special Qualities, including the attributes of 
Outstanding Universal Value.  
Current situation  
[3.01.02] National Parks are subject to the highest status of protection in relation to 
landscape and scenic beauty. We identify the Special Qualities which distinguish the 
Lake District from other National Parks and other parts of the country. These Special 
Qualities were reviewed and revised during the preparation of the Management Plan 
2015 -2020.  
[3.01.03] The attributes of Outstanding Universal Value identified upon inscription as 
a World Heritage Site al l reflect the Special Qualities that distinguish the Lake District 
as a UK National Park. There are inevitably pressures for change, which must be 
accommodated sensitively and harmoniously. Development proposals affecting the 
Lake District including its se tting will come under close scrutiny, usually by means of 
formal assessments and design statements, to ensure that immediate and long -term 
impacts are fully evaluated and will be compatible with National Park purposes (see 
introduction - The Purposes and D uty of National Parks).  
Policy 01: National and international s ignificance of the Lake 
Distric t 
The extraordinary harmony and beauty of the Lake District landscape and its Special 
Qualities, including the attributes of Outstanding Universal Value, will be conserved 
and enhanced.  
We will achieve this by supporting development proposals which are consistent with 
National Park Purposes and Duty. If it appears that there is a conflict between 
National Park purposes, we shall attach greater weight to the purpose  of conserving 
and enhancing the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the Lake District 
National Park.  
All development proposals should protect or enhance the authenticity, integrity and 
significance of the Lake District.  
Policy implementation  guidance  
[3.01.04] The Lake District is a nationally significant, special place and part of the 
cultural and natural heritage of the nation. As such, proposals for new development 17 
 will need to be carefully located and designed so that they respect the ‘st atutory 
purposes’ which underpin its status as a National Park.  
[3.01.05 ] A Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (LVIA) will be required to 
assess the impact of development proposals where the scale and nature of 
development may have a significant impact  on the spectacular landscape, Special 
Qualities and attributes of Outstanding Universal Value. We will work with others to 
influence their plans, strategies and proposals to ensure that development outside 
the Lake District does not damage or harm its set ting, or otherwise prejudice the 
achievement of National Park purposes.  
[3.01.06 ] The Outstanding Universal Value of the Lake District World Heritage Site 
as agreed at inscription, including its authenticity and integrity, is a key material 
consideration w hen decisions are taken on applications for planning permission and 
other relevant applications, whether by the Authority, neighbouring Local Planning 
Authorities or the Planning Inspectorate and Ministers. Heritage assessments will be 
required in a number  of cases, guidance on the preparation of these assessments 
can be found in our ‘Heritage Impact Assessment and information requirements 
practice guide’  available on our planning webpage.  
 
  18 
 Spatial strategy  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.02.01] The spa tial strategy will set out the level and type of development that is 
appropriate for different places, and encourages more sustainable living and working 
patterns by reducing unnecessary travel and avoiding sporadic development in the 
open countryside.  
Current situation  
[3.02.02] The distinctive settlement character comprising hamlets, villages and small 
towns is a Special Quality of the Lake District. The traditional settlement pattern has 
evolved over centuries and has been influenced by topography. Many of our 
settlements have developed s trong links between one another . Larger towns outside 
the Lake District provide access to higher tier services, such as hospitals and large 
retail outlets. Much of the Lake District is classed as being ‘in a sparse settin g’ and 
99.4 per cent is defined as open countryside.  
[3.02.03] The 'Core Strategy (Local Plan Part One)' first identified the 13 Rural 
Service Centres and 21 Villages set out in this Policy, and this Local Plan continues 
that approach. Whilst the scale and  extent of development in the Lake District should 
be limited, the Rural Service Centres and Villages provide the locations for the 
majority of housing, employment and retail development within the Lake District, and 
to a lesser extent the cluster communit ies (see table in Policy 02).  
[3.02.04] The limited environmental capacity for new development within the Lake 
District is a significant issue as highlighted by the Landscape Capacity Study (April 
2017) and flooding data (Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 20 18). This reinforces the 
long used assertion that the Lake District has limited development opportunities. 
Although many of our larger settlements are reaching their natural development 
capacity as dictated to by physical and environmental limitations, the re remains a 
need for certain types of development to support and maintain the viability, 
sustainability and resilience of our local communities, particularly affordable housing.  
[3.02.05] The Local Plan is not required to facilitate a large quantity of de velopment; 
its focus is on the management of the Lake District in accordance with its statutory 
purposes and duty, and on meeting the needs of its communities.  
Policy 02: Spatial strate gy 
We will enable development that contributes towards achieving the fo ur themes of 
the Vision, supports and maintains the vibrancy and sustainability of settlements  
distinctiveness and sense of place.  
We will achieve this by supporting development that is:  
1. in accordance with the table below, and  
2. of a scale and nature appropr iate to the character and function of the location in 
which it is proposed; and  19 
  contributes towards meeting the needs of the local community, or  
 brings benefit to the local community; or  
 delivers a prosperous economy; and  
3. proportionate  to the size and population of the settlement and is compatible with 
environmental and infrastructure capacity of the settlement to accommodate 
further growth.  
Planned growth is facilitated through the allocation of development sites for 
residential and em ployment purposes (including mixed use sites) and the Distinctive 
Area policies.

Cluster 
communities  
 A small settlement or group of 
small settlements which collectively 
or individually, have limited local 
services and facilities, or have easy 
access to such services in an 
adjacent Village or Rural Service 
Centre.   Be small -scale to meet 
local needs, and  
 Reinforce the 
distinctive settlement 
pattern of the area, 
and 
 Utilise pre viously 
developed land, 
buildings and 
domestic gardens, or  
 Helps sustain an 
existing business.  
 Exceptionally, where 
the identified housing 
need is proportionately 
high, we may consider 
a greenfield site.  
 
Open 
Countryside  We will only support proposals fo r development in the open 
countryside where the application demonstrates:  
 an essential need for a rural location; or  
 the location is necessary for the provision of public utilities 
and infrastructure; or  
 that it helps to sustain an existing business; or  
 it is necessary for and designed to support agricultural or 
forestry use; or  
 an appropriate extension, or reuse of an existing building.  
We will support the reuse of buildings for business or residential 
use where the building:  21 
  contributes to the landscape  character or historic 
environment, and  
 is structurally sound and capable of conversion, and  
 the development would not result in an unacceptable change 
to its character, and  
 is large enough to accommodate the use proposed without 
the necessity of major alt eration, extension or 
reconstruction, and  
 is easily accessible to the existing road network and suitable 
access arrangements can be secured.  
We will only support the redevelopment of an existing building 
where it can be demonstrated that the development w ould result 
in a significant enhancement of the landscape character or 
historic environment and would enhance its immediate setting.  
 
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.02.06] The spatial strategy reflects the traditional settlement pattern and allows a 
measure of dispersal across the Lake District’s most sustainable settlements, whilst 
also ensuring a degree of flexibility to avoid the over -concentration of development in 
those settlements with limited development capacity.  
[3.02.07] We wish to maximise de velopment opportunities by requiring developments 
in Rural Service Centre and/or Village locations to utilise the site efficiently, and by 
ensuring the proposal contributes towards meeting identified local needs as fully and 
as reasonably possible and with in the limitations of the site. For example, if the 
identified housing need in the locality is largely for three bed family homes and the 
site can reasonably deliver five dwellings of this size and type, that is our default 
position, we would not consider a proposal for a single six bed dwelling in these 
instances. We are supportive of using previously -developed land for new 
development.  
[3.02.08] Residential gardens in built up areas are classed as 'greenfield' on which 
development should be resisted, howe ver we recognise that many such sites can 
potentially make a modest but significant contribution towards meeting the identified 
housing need in the local community. Residential gardens are often within the 
natural limits of a settlement and they do not sha re the same characteristics or 
intrinsic value as the open countryside. As such, development opportunities on 
residential gardens to meet an identified local need is supported in principle in 
Cluster Communities. Development must be of a scale that is symp athetic to the role 
of the settlement and respect its appearance and physical capacity. We will take 
environmental constraints and pressures into account, and also consider 
infrastructure requirements and limitations.  22 
 [3.02.09] To help define which settlements we consider are Cluster Communities, 
these settlements should have two or more local services or community facilities, 
such as public houses, community halls and places of wo rship or have easy access 
to such services in an adjacent Village or R ural Service Centre.  
[3.02.10] Rural Service Centres are defined as the following settlements - 
Ambleside, Backbarrow/Haverthwaite, Bootle, Bowness and Windermere, Broughton 
in Furness, Caldbeck, Coniston, Glenridding/Patterdale, Gosforth, Grasmere, 
Hawksh ead, Keswick and Staveley.  
[3.02.11] Villages are defined as the following settlements - Askham, 
Bampton/Bampton Grange, Bassenthwaite; Braithwaite, Chapel Stile/Elterwater, 
Crosthwaite, Embleton, Ennerdale Bridge, Eskdale Green, Lane End 
(Waberthwaite), L indale, High/Low Lorton, Penruddock, Pooley Bridge, Portinscale, 
Ravenglass, Rosthwaite/Stonethwaite, Silecroft, Threlkeld, Troutbeck/Troutbeck 
Bridge, and Witherslack.  
  23 
 Principles of development  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.02.12] We want the Lake D istrict to be an inspirational example of sustainable 
development in action. We want to develop a proactive approach to enhance natural 
capital and cultural heritage throughout the Lake District to maximise multiple 
benefits for people and the environment,  by managing resources wisely for future 
generations to enjoy.  
Current situation  
[3.02.13] Integrating natural capital and ecosystem service approaches into the Local 
Plan will strengthen our approach to:  
 conserving and enhancing the diversity, extent, dis tribution and quality of natural 
capital in the Lake District, and  
 make sustainable use of ecosystem services from the Lake District’s natural 
capital.  
[3.02.14] We need to ensure new development enables communities to develop in a 
way that provides for t heir needs, but protects the Lake District’s landscape, and 
enhances our natural, built and historic environment; and as part of this, helping to 
improve biodiversity, use natural resources prudently, minimise waste and pollution, 
and mitigate and adapt to  climate change including moving to a low carbon 
economy.  
Figure 4 : How the policies deliver the principles of development  
 
 
24 
 Principles of development  
The Lake District will be an inspirational example of sustainable development in 
action. Natural and cul tural assets will be managed and used wisely for future 
generations.  
We will achieve this by supporting new developments which:  
a. Avoid areas at risk of flooding and further reduce flood risk elsewhere wherever 
possible;  
b. Use water resources efficiently;  
c. Improve or at least maintain water quality;  
d. Improve or maintain the natural functioning of coastal and river processes;  
e. Protect biodiversity and ensure proportionate and appropriate biodiversity net 
gain is secured;  
f. Protect or enhance carbon stored in peatla nd and woodland or, as a minimum, 
secure no net loss of carbon storage;  
g. Mitigate against climate change and improve resilience to the effects of climate 
change over a 25 –50 year timeframe;  
h. Conserve and enhance the landscape character of the Lake District and 
contribute to local landscape distinctiveness through locally inspired high quality 
design;  
i. Safeguard mineral resources and protect sources of building stone for the 
purpose of maintaining vernacular buildings and wider built settlement character 
within the Lake District;  
j. Protect sites of geodiversity value and, where possible, enhance these;  
k. Ensure resource efficiency and minimise waste;  
l. Conserve or enhance, or at least minimise the impact upon the quality,  
m. Avoid or minimise light and noise pollution;  
n. Improve or maintain air quality;  
o. Conserve and enhance the historic environment and cultural heritage;  
p. Conserve the capacity for sustainable production of food, water, raw materials 
and energy;  
q. Contribute positively to the health and wellbeing of our commun ities. 
 
Implementation guidance  
[3.02.15] The Principles of development are not in themselves a policy but provide 
the fundamental basis of achieving sustainable development in the Lake District. 
They sets out the criteria which each development proposal s hould seek to address. 
The delivery of these Principles link with specific policies in this Local Plan as shown 
in Figure 4.  
[3.02.16] Not all of the Principles will be relevant to each proposal for development, 
but all development should demonstrate how i t addresses the principles listed, where 
possible and appropriate. This should form part of the Design and Access 
Statement. We will judge how the proposal addresses the Principles through the 25 
 application of Policies 04 –07 or through reference to practice  guidance such as the 
National Planning Policy Framework, National Policy Guidance and specifically, the 
code of practice for the sustainable use of soils on construction sites. These policies 
provide detailed guidance on how proposals can deliver sustaina ble development.  
[3.02.17] It is particularly important that we do not compromise the ability of future 
generations to have the capacity for the sustainable production of food, and raw 
materials, etc. Where the development of agricultural land is demonstr ated to be 
necessary, areas of poorer quality land should be preferred to those of higher 
quality, therefore safeguarding good agricultural land.  
[3.02.18] Tranquil areas which remain relatively undisturbed by noise and are valued 
for the experience this o ffers, need to be conserved. Policy 05 : Protecting the 
spectacular landscape will ensure the intrinsic value of these areas will not be 
compromised by inappropriate new development.  
[3.02.19] The strategic response to the risks of climate change is holist ic, and will be 
achieved through the application of the raft of policies associated with the Principles 
of development.  
  26 
 Development and flooding  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.03.01] We will meet the challenge of planning for new development that avo ids 
increased vulnerability to the range of impacts arising from climate change, 
specifically flooding and coastal change.  
Current situation  
[3.03.02] Water is a key feature of the Lake District, with 9,158km of watercourses, 
26 miles of coastline and a fu rther 58.28sq km of still water including the 16 main 
lakes. Nine per cent of the Lake District is directly affected by a functional floodplain 
and/ or high flood risk area. This affects 5,599 buildings. The Lake District is no 
stranger to flooding with se veral significant flooding events being recorded. And 
these flood events are becoming more frequent and larger.  
[3.03.03] A refreshed Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (2018) has been produced. 
Many of the large rivers in the County have their origins within  the Lake District, such 
as the Kent, the Derwent and the Eamont. There is pressure to support upstream 
interventions such as appropriately designed and justified flood storage and natural 
flood management schemes which help to ‘slow the flow ‘and  mitigate  flooding 
downstream in densely populated locations.  
[3.03.04] The sea level will continue to rise which will affect the West Coast of the 
Lake District by changing the frequency of occurrence of high water levels and wave 
heights during storm events. The likely impacts are coastal erosion, damage to 
property and infrastructure and coastal flooding, and over the next 20 – 50 years 
there is the potential for net loss of intertidal and dunes overall. The marine plan for 
the north - west is being developed. The  St Bees Head to Earnse Point Shoreline 
Management Plan includes the coastal area in the Lake District.  
[3.03.05] Surface water run -off is a significant source of flooding in the Lake District, 
which makes its way into drains, combined sewers and surface water bodies. This 
has implications on water quality, for example Phosphorous is used in agriculture 
and through surface water run -off can find its way into water bodies and cause algal 
blooms which can reduce the amount of oxygen in the water, inhibiting aquatic life, 
and potentially impacting on recreational uses of the lakes.   
Policy 03: Development and flooding  
We want to increase the resilience of the Lake District to all types of flood event, 
including river, surface water and coastal flooding.  
We wil l achieve this by:  
1. supporting development proposals in accordance with the approach to managing 
flood risk in the National Planning Policy Framework and associated Planning 
Practice Guidance; and  27 
 2. supporting flood resilience schemes and Natural Flood Management which  
 are tailored to provide the optimum solution for the catchment as a whole, and  
 reduce flood risk in Rural Service Centres and Villages or areas of highest risk, or  
 reduce the impact of a flood event; and  
3. requiring  all developments to demonstrate how surface water run -off will be 
discharged in accordance with the surface water hierarchy, including where 
practicable, Sustainable Drainage Systems (SUDS).  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.03.06] We aim to steer new dev elopment to areas with the lowest probability of 
flooding. We will achieve this by assessing proposals in accordance with 
Government guidance, the online mapping resource from the Environment Agency 
and the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. Where developmen t must be located in an 
area of flood risk, the development must be made safe for its lifetime and not 
increase the risk of flooding in line with requirements of the National Planning Policy 
Framework and planning practice guidance.  
[3.03.07] Natural Flood  Management could include river restoration. Flood resilience 
schemes can be at catchment scale or at a settlement level, and can also relate to 
individual properties.  
[3.03.08] For sites identified as being at potential flood risk from surface water run o ff 
we require applications to be supported by a site specific flood risk assessment. 
These should be undertaken by qualified personnel. We wish to constrain the 
volume of runoff to any drain, sewer or surface water body, by seeking opportunities 
to reduce the overall level of flood risk in the area and beyond. The runoff volume 
from the developed site should not exceed the runoff volume when the site was 
undeveloped. Every option should be investigated before discharging surface water 
into a public sewerage  network. A discharge to groundwater or watercourse may  
require the consent of  the Environment Agency. Applicants wishing to discharge to 
public sewer will need to submit clear evidence demonstrating why alternative 
options are not available.  
[3.03.09] Con trolling surface water run -off can be as simple as a green roof on a new 
extension, or using permeable material for parking areas to more complex landscape 
engineered solutions such as a rain garden, swales and reed beds. Not only will this 
help to reduce the impact that surface water runoff has on the sewer system, but 
may also help to improve the quality of the water being discharged into the water 
environment as a result of the treatment systems provided by Sustainable Drainage 
Systems (SUDs). The prefer ence will be for new development to include genuine 
sustainable drainage systems as opposed to underground tanked storage systems 
for surface water. Approved development proposals will be expected to be 
supplemented by appropriate maintenance and managemen t regimes for surface 
water drainage schemes. SUDS may not be practicable for some forms of 28 
 development, we will make this judgement by considering Planning Practice 
Guidance and liaise with the lead local flood authority.  
[3.03.10] We will avoid inappropr iate development in areas at risk of flooding in order 
to safeguard land from development that is required for current and future flood 
management (such as a depression acting as a natural store of surface water on 
part of a site). And, if new development proposals allow, culverted watercourses 
should be restored to open channels and no watercourse should be culverted unless 
there is an overriding need to do so.

original house had flooded twice in ten years. A highly contemporary design in 
sensitive lake shore location which has been designed to reduce the risk of future 
flooding. The design provides a bold use of both modern and vernacula r materials.]   29 
 Biodiversity and geodiversity  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.04.01] We want to achieve bigger, better, more joined up and resilient habitats 
which support wildlife and species and improve ecosystem functions whilst 
respecting the evolutio n of the cultural landscape. We aim to protect biodiversity and 
deliver biodiversity net gain. We also want to avoid or minimise harm to sites of 
geodiversity interest.  
Current situation  
[3.04.02] The Lake District has an impressive extent of international , national, and 
locally designated areas – from Ramsar’s, Special Protection Areas and Special 
Areas of Conservation to County Wildlife sites and Local Geological Sites.  
[3.04.03] Biodiversity includes all species of animals and plants. The Lake District i s 
represented by a rich array of plant and animal species found in habitats and 
ecosystems which reflect the influence of geology, climate, and human activity that 
has developed since the end of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago. There is 
known decli ne in biodiversity across the country. This trend is reflected locally by 77 
per cent of the area of Lake District sites that are protected for their biodiversity 
(SACs, SPAs and SSSI) being categorised as in ‘unfavourable condition’ status. The 
risk to bi odiversity is not confined to protected sites, and any decline poses risks not 
just to species and habitats but also to a variety of benefits that Lake District 
ecosystems provides. These include clean water and air, high quality food, wood 
products and ca rbon storage, and recreation and spiritual refreshment. To help 
redress the decline and in line with government intentions, biodiversity net gain 
should be achieved when granting planning permission.  
Policy 04: Biodiversity and geodiversity  
We want to:  
 protect our important habitats, sites and species;  
 achieve bigger, better, more joined up and resilient habitats; and  
 improve the function of ecosystems.  
In accordance with the Biodiversity Supplementary Planning Document , we will 
achieve this by:  
 applying  the mitigation hierarchy to all proposals;  
 supporting proposals which conserve and enhance biodiversity and ecosystems 
processes; and  
 ensuring proportionate and appropriate biodiversity net gain is secured.  
We will only support proposals which would have  significant and harmful direct or 
indirect effects on biodiversity and ecosystems processes where:  
 the need for the development clearly outweighs the harm caused; and  30 
  
 an appropriate scheme is proposed which will secure compensation and net 
increases in b iodiversity.  
Where a financial contribution is required the rates will be set out in the Biodiversity 
Supplementary Planning Document.  
We will not permit development detrimental to geodiversity sites unless the need for 
development outweighs the harm cause d. 
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.04.04] We will apply the ‘mitigation hierarchy’ in the assessment of all 
development proposals as outlined in the Biodiversity Supplementary Planning 
Document. This also includes a full hierarchy of the important sites,  habitats and 
species. The mitigation hierarchy is a term given to a sequential process which first 
seeks to prevent harm to biodiversity through avoidance and reduction of expected 
negative impacts.  
[3.04.05] Information is provided in the Biodiversity S upplementary Planning 
Document to advise applicants how best to minimise impact through avoidance. This 
includes how to find out information about known features of biodiversity and 
geological interest and highlights our expected approach to the submission  of 
information about the biodiversity affected by the proposal. A full hierarchy of all of 
the site, habitat and species designations affecting the Lake District is given in the 
Biodiversity Supplementary Planning Document, together with the legal require ments 
and sets out the approach that would be taken with respect to decision making when 
weighing the relative importance of the biodiversity affected against the need for the 
development.  
[3.04.06] Where any residual impacts remain following all efforts t o prevent harm, the 
significance of these residual impacts will be assessed, taking into account a wide 
range of factors including status of the site, habitat or species affected and the 
degree of impact. This assessment will then be weighed against the ne ed for the 
development.  
[3.04.07] Circular 06/2005 provides further guidance in respect of the statutory 
obligations for biodiversity and geological conservation and their impact on the 
planning system. We have a general duty to take reasonable steps to f urther the 
conservation and enhancement of the features for which sites are of special interest. 
Development which may have a significant effect on Internationally Designated 
Habitat Sites either alone or in combination with other plans or projects will re quire a 
project level Habitats Regulation Assessment. Development which would adversely 
affect the integrity of Internationally Designated Habitat Sites will not be permitted 
unless there are no alternative solutions and there is an imperative reason of 
overriding public interest (IROPI) for permitting the development and necessary 
compensatory measures can be secured.  31 
 [3.04.08] Where biodiversity impacts are considered to be unavoidable, we expect all 
biodiversity features affected to be compensated for to gether with measures to 
secure biodiversity net gain. We will ensure that the level of biodiversity net gain 
required will be proportionate to the type and scale of the impact. We will use a 
locally defined metric based on national guidance to quantify the  compensation 
required to replace biodiversity lost and the biodiversity net gain required. For 
development proposals where there is no demonstrable impact on biodiversity, we 
will encourage developers to include positive measures for biodiversity.  
[3.04.0 9] Greater detail on our approach to defining appropriate levels of biodiversity 
compensation and biodiversity net gain will be set out in the Biodiversity 
Supplementary Planning Document. And this document will also highlight examples 
of positive measures  to reverse biodiversity decline that developers can refer to 
where they are minded to provide voluntary additional contributions when submitting  
planning  applications.  
[3.04.10] We want to ‘protect sites of geodiversity value and, where possible, 
enhance’  in line with our Principles of Development. Where relevant, development 
proposals should make a positive contribution to the protection of geodiversity and 
where opportunities exist, enhance sites of geological value commensurate with their 
importance.  
[3.04.11] Harm to sites of geological interest should be avoided. Where the need for 
and benefits of the development are considered to outweigh the harm to the 
geological interest of the site, the harm should be mitigated including seeking wider 
public benef its. 
  32 
 Protecting the spectacular landscape  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.05.01] We  want to conserve and enhance the extraordinary beauty and harmony 
of the Lake District landscape, and Special Qualities and its attributes of Outstanding 
Universal Value for future generations to enjoy.  
Current situation  
[3.05.02] The Lake District is one  of the world’s finest cultural landscapes. The 
spectacular landscape, wildlife and cultural heritage of the Lake District is unique – 
and of such quality and universal value – that it entirely underpins how the area 
functions economically, socially and en vironmentally.  
[3.05.03] The diversity of the landscape is key to its beauty and significance, and 
includes coast, lakes, distinctive farmland, fell, woodland, industrial activity and 
settlement. Each of the Lake District’s valleys has an individual disti nctiveness based 
on landform, biodiversity and cultural heritage.  
[3.05.04] Tranquillity is a quality of calm that people experience in places full of 
sights and sounds of nature, and National Parks are viewed as one of the best 
places to gain this experie nce. Tranquillity can be damaged by the intrusive sights 
and sounds of man -made structures such as new roads, poorly designed lighting 
and power lines.  
Policy 05: Protecting the spectacular landscape  
We will conserve and enhance the extraordinary beauty an d harmony of the Lake 
District landscape, its Special Qualities and attributes of Outstanding Universal 
Value.  
We will achieve this by supporting development:  
 that ensures the highest level of protection is given to the landscape, and  
 where the type, desi gn, scale and level of activity maintains local distinctiveness, 
sense of place, and where appropriate, tranquillity.   
Decisions will be guided by the Lake District Landscape Character Assessment 
recognising the distinctive characteristics identified in t he Landscape Character 
Types and Areas of Distinctive Character, the World Heritage Site Nomination 
Document and the Historic Landscape Characterisation.  
We will use development opportunities to reduce or remove existing landscape 
detractors.  
Policy implem entation guidance  
[3.05.05] This policy will implement the intentions of the Principles of development by 
ensuring the spectacular landscape of the Lake District is not compromised by new 
development. The tranquillity of the countryside should be valued an d protected from 33 
 poor development decisions. New developments may create additional noise, 
particularly in the context of road traffic, industrial equipment and recreational 
activities, as well as during the construction phase, and should be considered whe n 
taking decisions on new development proposals.  
[3.05.06] Woodlands are recognised as one of the Lake Districts most valuable 
scenic and wildlife assets. Development which involves or would lead to the 
clearance of or damage to semi -natural or amenity woo dland or important trees will 
not normally be permitted. Policy 04: Biodiversity and geodiversity is also relevant to 
the removal of woodland.  
[3.05.07] This policy provides an opportunity to use development proposals to 
reduce and remove existing landscap e detractors. For example, it may be possible 
to combine communications infrastructure by sharing masts to reduce the impact on 
the landscape or an application for a large agricultural building may provide 
opportunity to consolidate less attractive buildin gs. 
[3.05.08] A Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (LVIA) will be required to 
assess the impact of development proposals where the scale and nature of 
development may have a significant impact on the spectacular landscape, Special 
Qualities or attribut es of Outstanding Universal Value. This evidence should be 
submitted with a planning application.  
  34 
 Design and development  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.06.01] We want all development to be inspired by and contribute to local 
distinctiveness, to be res ilient to climate change and extreme weather events, and 
reduce carbon emissions through sustainable resource management during design 
and construction. We want development that achieves design excellence that is of 
the right type, and in the right locatio n, that adds to the existing high quality natural 
and built environment.  
Current situation  
[3.06.02] Design should create durable and flexible developments that can adapt to 
climate change and to changes in social and economic conditions. Consideration 
needs to be given to national design initiatives and toolkits to enhance design, for 
example Inclusive design, Building for Nature and Secured by Design.  
[3.06.03] Accessibility and adaptability of buildings is covered by Building 
Regulations Part M. Some of these regulations are optional however with an ageing 
population and increasing numbers of people working from home, it is vital that 
housing is used effectively. By encouraging new homes that provide flexibility in 
response to changing social, technologic al and economic needs, we can ensure our 
communities are increasingly resilient. We consider that digital infrastructure is 
integral to all development. This is covered by Building Regulations but should be 
considered at the design stage.  
[3.06.04] In 2015 the energy efficiency requirements, along with the zero -carbon 
home policy and the Code for Sustainable Homes were repealed to make Building 
Regulations the sole authority regarding energy efficiency standards for residential 
development.  However, en ergy efficiency should be considered at the early stages 
of a proposal and may contribute to meeting the target set out in Policy 20: 
Renewable and low carbon energy.  
[3.06.05] There is a challenge to reduce construction and demolition waste from new 
devel opment by ensuring it is a consideration in the assessment of planning 
applications.  
Policy 06: D esign and development  
We want to achieve design excellence in all development, to be inspired by and 
contribute to local distinctiveness, to be resilient to cl imate change and extreme 
weather events, and reduce carbon emissions.  
Development must:  
 reinforce the importance of local character by having regard to scale, height, 
density, layout, appearance and materials;  
 create safe and accessible environments and wh ich ensures development is not 
vulnerable to crime;  35 
  not have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of adjoining residents and users 
of the proposed development, due to visual intrusion, overlooking, 
overshadowing, overbearing effect, noise, light pollution  or other adverse 
impacts; and  
 include suitable accessible space for waste management facilities of a scale and 
type appropriate to the proposal and location.  
Development should:  
 be inspired by the natural environment and use innovative design and local 
materials to reflect local distinctiveness;  
 achieve the highest practicable energy efficiency;  
 use low -embodied carbon building materials;  
 minimise water demand;  
 avoid or minimise light pollution;  
 reuse existing buildings rather than constructing new ones;  
 be designed to be adaptable to prolong the useful life of the development;  
 use construction methods that allow disassembly rather than demolition  and 
facilitate the reuse of materials; and  
 conserve, enhance or create new Local Green Space.  
Policy implement ation guidance  
[3.06.06] Design should create inspirational places that are accessible to everyone, 
and inclusivity should be considered early in the design process. Development 
should be designed to ensure places are safe and accessible for people who live, 
work and visit. We want to maintain and increase the feeling of being safe and to 
minimise crime by ensuring Secured by Design principles are incorporated in all 
public realm schemes and development proposals, outlined in Design and Access 
Statements . Security measures for domestic environments will be different to 
commercial or industrial developments however they should be in keeping with the 
locality and not detract from the surrounding environment.  
[3.06.07] We will consider the orientation of dev elopment, site layout and building 
design, the type of materials used, and the prudent use of existing and new 
resources to ensure energy efficiency has been addressed in all development 
proposals. For example, a south facing building will optimise heat an d light from the 
sun which will reduce the need for heating and lighting energy requirements and 
therefore energy costs.  
[3.06.08] Low embodied carbon and local building materials reduce carbon 
emissions during the construction process. We expect design p roposals to consider 
ways of reducing embodied carbon, such as using materials which:  
 are inherently lower energy/carbon intensity in production than their conventional 
equivalents (such as timber frame building);  
 have lower transport -related carbon emissions (locally sourced materials);  
 have higher recycled content (or reclaimed products);  36 
  have high levels of durability and relatively low through -life maintenance,  
 such as local building stone and slate.  
[3.06.09] Reductions in carbon emissions can b e gained through reducing water 
consumption. For example, this can be done through rainwater and greywater 
harvesting systems and installing water efficient fixtures and fittings when completing 
the development.  
[3.06.10] Local Green Space has multi -funct ional purposes for wildlife, health and 
wellbeing and water management. ‘Building with Nature’ is a new benchmark for the 
design and maintenance of Local Green Space in new development and we 
encourage development proposals to consider this initiative.

almost entirely off -grid.]   37 
 Historic environment  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.07.01] We want to protect and enhance the character, authenticity, integrity, 
setting and views of the historic environment and its her itage assets.  
Current situation  
[3.07.02] Heritage assets are an irreplaceable resource and their effective 
conservation delivers wider social, cultural, economic and environmental benefits; 
therefore, decisions affecting their future must be taken with f ull understanding of the 
consequences. The Lake District has a rich archaeological heritage that extends 
from prehistory to the recent past. Significant remains include Neolithic stone circles 
and axe factories, Bronze Age settlements and burial cairns, Ro man forts and roads, 
medieval abbeys and post medieval industrial sites. Many of these archaeological 
features are visible in the landscape but others are hidden under peat or pasture.  
[3.07.03] Historic buildings in the Lake District are a crucial element  of the historic 
environment. Small scale changes over time, especially the standardisation of 
building materials, and different methods of construction and external finishes, can 
erode the special character and appearance of buildings and places. Conserva tion is 
an active process of maintenance and managing change therefore local knowledge 
and survival of local skills, crafts, traditions and building techniques is crucial for 
conservation of the historic environment. It is important that the wider social, cultural, 
economic and environmental benefits of historic environment assets are maximised 
to ensure their conservation. Climate change can pose a significant threat to historic 
environment assets and its protection and resilience are important issues that  need 
to be considered.  
[3.07.04] It is therefore no surprise that the historic environment contributes 
enormously to the Lake District’s economy and to its attractiveness as a place to live 
and visit, helping to attract millions of visitors every year.  
Policy 07: Historic environment  
We will seek to conserve and enhance the significance of heritage assets, including 
the character, authenticity, integrity, setting and views of the historic environment 
which include:  
 designated heritage assets on the Statuto ry List of Buildings of Special 
Architectural or Historic Interest, or on the Schedule of Monuments; Registered 
Parks, Gardens and Battlefields; Conservation Areas; or The English Lake 
District or Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage Sites;  
 locally  important sites and features identified on the Lake District Historic 
Environment Record;  
 buildings and sites of heritage interest which are not statutorily designated, 
including local lists of buildings of heritage interest;  
 the historic character of set tlements.  38 
 Where appropriate we will encourage the sympathetic reuse of buildings of 
archaeological or historic importance, which make a positive contribution to the 
landscape character or historic environment, and which reinforce local 
distinctiveness and  sense of place. Where alterations to a building of archaeological 
or historic importance are proposed these must be sympathetic to its character, form, 
and original purpose.  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.07.05] Decisions affecting the integrity of her itage assets must be taken with full 
understanding of the consequences. Proposals which would harm a heritage asset 
will not normally be permitted. We will therefore use a range of evidence to assess if 
development is appropriate and determine how the sign ificance of archaeological 
and heritage assets may be affected by development proposals. This may include:  
 the use of Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans;  
 Lake District Historic Environment Record;  
 Historic Landscape Characterisation and relevant mapping that defines the 
attributes of Outstanding Universal Value;  
 ICOMOS Heritage Impact Assessments;  
 World Heritage Site Nominations documents for The English Lake District World 
Heritage Site and Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage Si te; 
 Heritage Statements including statement of significance; and  
 desk -based assessments and, where necessary, a field evaluation and / or a 
historic building report.  
 [3.07.06] Alterations to a building of archaeological or historic importance — 
including non-designated heritage assets, such as field barns and other buildings, 
which form part of our cultural heritage, should be sympathetic to the character, 
form, setting, and original purpose. This does not preclude applications for a change 
of use rather t he intention is to retain features associated with its original purpose 
and protect and enhance the significance of the asset. For example, if the building 
was originally for agricultural use then the alterations should not lose the original 
character and form of the building that denote its original function. Any reuse and / or 
alternations proposals should take into account the impact of associated 
infrastructure on the setting of the heritage asset and provide detail on how the 
proposal will protect and enhance the significance of the asset. We will support 
proposals that reduce energy consumption or incorporate renewable energy which 
do not detract from the historic character of the building.  
[Case Study: Lowther Castle  
Lowther Castle had fallen into a s tate of serious disrepair. The ruins, attached stable 
block and a number of the surrounding structures are Grade II* listed. Planning 
permission was granted for the re -use of listed buildings and re -creation and re -
interpretation of landscaped gardens. The  ruined castle has been sensitively 
consolidated to prevent further deterioration. The stable block and courtyard has 39 
 been restored along with the former gardens to create a successful tourist 
destination attracting 90,000 visitors per annum.]   40 
 Infrastruct ure and developer contributions  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.08.01] We want new development to be adequately supported by infrastructure, 
and ensure that developments can be made acceptable and contribute positively to 
managing pressures in the Lake D istrict.  
Current situation  
[3.08.02] The Infrastructure Delivery Plan for the Lake District identifies planned 
infrastructure improvements and deficiencies in existing provision. New 
developments can lead to greater pressures on existing infrastructure so it is 
important that new development is supported by adequate infrastructure. Where 
there is not adequate infrastructure in place we need to ensure that development 
provides the necessary infrastructure or contributes financially to its provision. There 
are many types of infrastructure which are defined in the Glossary.  
Policy 08: Infrastructure and developer contributions  
We will seek to ensure that new development is adequately supported by 
infrastructure, and ensure that developments can be made acceptab le in the context 
of conserving and enhancing the Special Qualities and attributes of Outstanding 
Universal Value.  
To achieve this we will only permit development where:  
 adequate infrastructure exists relevant to the development proposed without 
prejudic ing existing users; or  
 any additional or enhanced infrastructure necessary to mitigate the impact of the 
development is provided either directly as physical works or through a financial 
contribution.  
An independent viability assessment must be submitted w here it is considered that 
physical works or a financial contribution would make a development unviable.  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.08.03 ] The Authority will seek advice on site -specific requirements from 
infrastructure providers and statutory consu ltees at the point of a planning 
application being submitted or as part of pre -application discussions.  
[3.08.04 ] We will use the Cumbria Development Design Guide to inform required 
parking standards for new development proposals which will require certain  
standards of parking provision, such as residential development schemes, 
employment site developments, retail sites, tourism attractions, or hotels and guest 
accommodation.  
[3.08.05 ] Where infrastructure is found to be inadequate for the development 
propo sed we will seek either the physical improvements to the infrastructure or a 
financial contribution to its improvement through a planning condition or a planning 41 
 obligation. Scheme viability will be considered in accordance with the National 
Planning Polic y Framework and practice guidance.  
[3.08.06 ] Planning obligations may relate to on -site or off -site provision of:  
 highways infrastructure  
 sustainable transport infrastructure  
 service and utilities infrastructure  
 enhancement and maintenance of the historic environment and heritage assets 
biodiversity or wildlife corridors  
 enhancement of the public realm  
 maintenance and enhancement of public rights of way , local green space, sports 
and leisure provision and/or play  areas  
 flood defences and mitigation and adaptation  
 education provision  
 health facilities  
 facilities providing accessibility for all e.g. Changing Places facilities  
[3.08.07 ] Financial contributions from Planning Obligations may be pooled in order to 
fund infrastructure items necessary to support development. All such agreements 
shall be necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms, directly 
related to the development and fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind. 
Details of infras tructure projects are found in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. This is 
a ‘live’ document and will be regularly reviewed and updated and the most up -to-date 
version will be used to assess the type of infrastructure towards which contributions 
may be sough t. 
[3.08.08 ] Should a planning application be proposed to deliver an infrastructure 
project, a project level Habitats Regulations Assessment may be required to support 
the decision making process.  
  42 
 Distinctive Areas  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.09.01 ] We want all development to effectively demonstrate the key themes of the 
Vision and reinforce the distinctiveness of place, whilst also enabling localised 
solutions to specific planning issues through the Distinctive Area policies.  
Current situation  
[3.09.02] First developed in 2010, Distinctive Areas refine the Spatial Strategy by 
setting out our intended approach for each of the five Distinctive Areas of the Lake 
District. They reflect the subtly distinctive characteristics, specific issues and 
challen ges of each area that are in some ways unique from one another, thus 
making the strategy innovative, clearly spatial and locally distinctive. Distinctive Area 
solutions are designed to address specific planning issues in each area that would 
otherwise be c onsidered different to the overall approach of the generic policies.  
  43 
 Figure 5 : Lake District Distinctive Areas  
  
44 
 Policy 09: North Distinctive Area  
Development in the North Distinctive Area will reinforce distinctiveness of place, 
deliver key themes of the Vision and enable local solutions to specific planning 
issues.  
To achieve this we will:  
 support the provision of more bungalows and two -bed properties to help address 
the mismatch between the severe lack of availability and the high  aspirations/ 
expectation of local communities for this type of dwelling and reflect the need for 
smaller properties;  
 support development that retains the Mary Hewitson Hospital and safeguards it 
for the purposes of securing long term health care provision in Keswick;  
 support the development of a new leisure centre and pool in Keswick. Any new 
leisure facility will need to reflect its remarkable and unique setting both in design 
and uses, maximising its connectivity with the outdoors;  
 support flood resilient  sporting facilities for the community based at Keswick 
School;  
 secure enhancements through development opportunities to ‘the Ginnels’ in 
Keswick, and connectivity between the town and lake;  
 secure solutions to car parking problems at Catbells and Seathwai te Valley,  
 support appropriate opportunities for recreation and leisure uses of Town Cass, 
subject to ground conditions, where it would lead to conservation of the 
landscape character;  
 support appropriate redevelopment of and/or extension to the Field Stu dy Council 
site at Blencathra as an environmental education centre;  
 support appropriate enhancement of the Theatre by the Lake and its facilities to 
consolidate its regional role as a cultural centre and attract new audiences;  
 secure a Masterplan for the Whinlatter Centre, including valley -scale landscape 
restoration, redevelopment and expansion of its recreational and leisure uses. 
This may include new visitor accommodation utilising the topography of the 
landform. Proposals should not adversely impact on  surrounding settlements, 
and should secure a net improvement in traffic flows at Braithwaite Village, a net 
reduction in parking at the Whinlatter Centre, together with an increased role for 
Keswick as a transport interchange hub;  
 secure improvements thro ugh development which deliver enhancements of the 
foreshore at Keswick and Isthmus Wood and Peninsula, where it would conserve 
the unique character of the area;  
 support appropriate opportunities for park and ride/walk facilities on the northern 
edge of Kes wick. Any proposal will need to demonstrate how it secures onward 
travel by sustainable transport and helps to address traffic congestion in Keswick 
and surrounding areas. Proposals will need to be considered as part of a 
package of improvements in Keswick . Consideration will also be given to facilities 
to improve visitor experiences and use of the fells from this location;  45 
  support appropriate additional car parking at existing town centre car parks if 
changes to on -street parking restrictions in residentia l areas reduce the overall 
capacity available to visitors in Keswick.  
  46 
 Policy 10: East Distinctive Area  
Development in the East Distinctive Area will reinforce distinctiveness of place, 
deliver key themes of the Vision and enable local solutions to specif ic planning 
issues.  
To achieve this we will:  
 support small scale housing development in Matterdale Parish to reflect the very 
rural and dispersed nature of the community and to support its long term 
sustainability;  
 support improvements which enhance cyclin g and walking options in the 
Haweswater valley;  
 support the enhancement to the quality of the offer at Aira Force together with 
consideration of an extension of the existing pier to accommodate and encourage 
a greater number of visitors by boat. Improvemen ts to the jetty and facilities will 
make the site more robust, diverse and able to disperse visitors using sustainable 
transport connections.  
 secure improved connectivity of the existing bridleway network between the 
Yorkshire Dales and Lake District Natio nal Parks by working with neighbouring 
authorities, and promote the existing ‘quiet road’ network as a cycling destination;  
 secure a Whole Estate Plan for Lowther Estate, to include the restoration of listed 
buildings, and new visitor accommodation and fac ilities where it demonstrates the 
development is needed to sustain the overall Estate and delivers multiple wider 
public benefits including maintaining the cultural landscape;  
 support appropriate schemes which facilitate landscape recovery at existing 
caravan sites / parks to reflect their sensitive and inspirational setting;  
 support appropriate opportunities for a new covered maintenance shed for 
Ullswater Steamers which has suitable highway and lake access;  
 support  appropriate additional car and coach parking provision to serve Pooley 
Bridge and onward travel.  
  47 
 Policy 11: West Distinctive Area  
Development in the West Distinctive Area will reinforce distinctiveness of place, 
deliver key themes of the Vision and enab le local solutions to specific planning 
issues.  
To achieve this we will:  
 support infrastructure and service improvements to the Cumbria Coast rail line;  
 support the new coastal path, including pedestrian and cycle crossings of the 
rivers Irt and the Esk, l inking in with the wider network;  
 support improvements to the pedestrian and cycle links from the railway stations 
and coastal path into the valley heads to enhance the use of sustainable active 
travel options;  
 support the strengthening of the role of Rav englass as a transport interchange, 
providing improved links with Muncaster Castle and to the Ravenglass and 
Eskdale railway;  
 secure solutions to parking problems in the Wasdale Valley for the benefit of 
residents and visitors, and to improve the managemen t of the Three Peak 
Challenge;  
 support appropriate opportunities to strengthen the coastal tourism offer at 
Silecroft;  
 support appropriate new caravan and camping sites where proposals are 
consistent with site specific criteria in Policy 18 and other rel evant policies;  
 support appropriate development that enhances the role of Bootle and Bootle rail 
station to act as a sustainable transport hub to serve the wider area;  
 consider identifying a Coastal Change Management Area where the rates of 
shoreline chang e are significant.  
  48 
 Policy 12: South Distinctive Area  
Development in the South Distinctive Area will reinforce distinctiveness of place, 
deliver key themes of the Vision and enable local solutions to specific planning 
issues.  
To achieve this we will:  
 supp ort enhancements to the A590 at Haverthwaite to improve road safety and 
community connectivity;  
 support public realm enhancement of ‘The Squares’ in Hawkshead;  
 support a public sewer between Lakeside and Newby Bridge;  
 secure a Whole Estate Plan for the Gr aythwaite Estate, to include restoration of 
listed buildings, and expansion of new visitor accommodation and facilities where 
it demonstrates the development is needed to sustain the overall Estate and 
deliver wider public benefits. Sustainable transport c onnections need to be made 
available, both within the Estate and beyond, including by water;  
 secure in partnership with relevant stakeholders a Masterplan(s) for key visitor 
destinations on the western shore of the northern basin of Windermere, including 
for Hilltop, Wray Castle and Low Wray campsite. The Masterplan(s) should 
enhance the visitor experience whilst further reducing the reliance on the private 
car, and include transport options which consider sustainable movement between 
the Ferry and Hawkshea d to help enhance the visitor experience;  
 support appropriate new low density small groupings of caravan s and camping 
provision within or well related to Hawkshead  where it improves and enhances 
the vibrancy of the village centre, where sustainable transport connections are 
made available, and where the proposal is consistent with site specific criteria in 
Policy 18 and other relevant policies;  
 support appropriate new caravan and camping, adjacent to the Grizedale Centre, 
where it maximises forest cover, provides sustainable transport connections to 
Hawkshead; demonstrably minimises private car use; and benefits Hawkshead’s 
economy;  
 support appropriate opportunities  for a new covered maintenance shed and jetty 
for the Steam Yacht Gondola which has suitable highway and lake access;  
 support appropriate additional car and coach parking in Coniston.  
  49 
 Policy 13: Central and South East Distinctive Area  
Development in the  Central and South East Distinctive Area will reinforce 
distinctiveness of place, deliver key themes of the Vision and enable local solutions 
to specific planning issues.  
To achieve this we will:  
 support development that retains the university campus at Am bleside and 
safeguards it for the purposes of further and higher education including the 
retention of student accommodation;  
 support small scale housing development in Longsleddale Valley to reflect the 
very rural and dispersed nature of the community and to support its long term 
sustainability;  
 support a public sewer along the A591 between Waterhead and Windermere;  
 support advertising (signage and lighting) that is sympathetic to the historic towns 
and buildings of Windermere and Ambleside;  
 support improv ements to the existing public rights of way network in Lyth Valley 
and the Kent Estuary and between Arnside and Meathop, including the crossing 
of Arnside Viaduct;  
 support improvements to private coach parking at Rectory Road Coach Park. 
Visual improvement s at this international visitor gateway are required as well as 
remodelling to improve capacity, and access and egress arrangements;  
 support enhancement of Windermere Station and its role as a transport 
interchange with capacity improvements, including a p assing loop on the Lakes 
Line to improve rail services and enable electrification of the line;  
 secure the rejuvenation and conservation of ornamental parkland around 
Windermere lake which reinforce the picturesque landscape;  
 secure improvements through de velopment which deliver the allocated strategic 
regeneration site — Bowness Bay and The Glebe;  
 support appropriate reuse or redevelopment of the former University of Cumbria 
satellite site, Hilltop, for alternative uses;  
 support appropriate schemes which f acilitate landscape recovery at existing 
caravan sites/parks to reflect their sensitive and inspirational setting;  
 support appropriate solutions to car and coach parking problems and traffic 
management in Windermere;  
 support appropriate additional parking provision at existing car parks in 
Ambleside and Bowness;  
 support appropriate regeneration of Ferry Nab to serve as a launch pad for 
recreation of Windermere lake and surrounding areas by sustainable transport. 
Improved connectivity with the adjacent Brait hwaite Fold Car Park would be 
encouraged, alongside improved surface treatment of Braithwaite Fold Car Park 
to enable year round use;  
 support appropriate use of the former Windermere Aquatic boat sheds at Beech 
Hill for maintenance and boat storage facilit ies; 50 
  support appropriate further improvements and enhancement of the existing 
gardens and their facilities at Fell Foot Country Park, including improved 
sustainable transport connections from the site to Lakeside and other 
destinations;  
 support appropriate  reconfiguration of the three existing hotel sites of Cragwood, 
Merewood and Briery Wood to offer collectively a unique visitor experience where 
it respects these villas and associated villa landscapes of the site and 
picturesque landscape. Opportunities t o strengthen the sustainable linkages 
between sites and their surrounding areas will be sought;  
 support appropriate regeneration of Waterhead  Marina to provide for an increase 
in overnight boat stays, both private and public. Any on -land redevelopment will 
need to reflect its critical location forming the southern entry into Ambleside.  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.09.03] The Distinctive Ar ea policies aim to deliver the four themes of the Vision 
across the Distinctive Areas in the Lake District, as well as deliver tailored solutions 
to specific planning issues being experienced in certain parts of the Lake District.  
[3.09.04] Applications fo r planning permission will still be considered against all 
relevant polices in the Local Plan to determine the acceptability of the proposal. For 
certain developments a project level Habitats Regulation Assessment may also be 
required having regard to the impact pathways identified in the Appropriate 
Assessment (2019).  
  51 
 Allocations of land  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.14.01] We want to support the delivery of housing to meet identified shortages, 
and employment and retail space that supports the econo my of the Lake District.  
Current situation  
[3.14.02] Allocating land increases certainty about where development can take 
place. This benefits communities, landowners and developers alike. It significantly 
increases certainty over how planning decisions wi ll be made on those sites. 
Applying for planning permission is seen by some developers as unpredictable and 
uncertain, and may prevent developers from bringing proposals forward due to the 
risk of uncertainty in securing permission. By allocating land for specific uses it 
reduces the uncertainty by establishing the principle of use, leaving only details of 
the proposal to be agreed.  
[3.14.03] The allocations have been identified specifically to contribute towards 
meeting known needs and demands within the L ake District. We have not worked to 
minimum ‘targets’ for allocating land in specific locations. This approach would have 
potentially compromised our commitment to only allocate sites where we can 
demonstrate that they are well suited for their intended us e(s). 
Policy 14: Allocations of land  
We will support the development of allocated land (Table 2) where its use reflects 
the purposes of the allocation and where:  
 site-specific requirements and considerations identified have been satisfactorily 
addressed; a nd 
 on housing sites, development meets identified local needs and local affordable 
needs.  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.14.04] The list of allocated sites are provided in Table 2, and can be viewed along 
with the site -specific requirements identified i n the policy above in Section 4 and on  
the interactive policies map.  
[3.14.05] Policy 14 supports the allocation of sites for housing, employment and 
mixed use developments across the Lake District. The purpose of our land 
allocations is to identify speci fic areas of land where we are confident in supporting 
development for particular purposes. For example, to ensure a supply of land to 
deliver housing. Allocating land increases certainty on where development can take 
place which benefits communities, land owners and developers. It significantly 
increases certainty over how planning decisions will be made on those sites.  52 
 [3.14.06] If a development proposal comes forward on a site which has not been 
allocated, this will be considered as a windfall site and th e proposal will be 
considered against policies within the Local Plan.

 Housing  
What are  we trying to achieve?  
[3.15.01] Our strategic approach to housing is strongly focused on making 
meaningful interventions to the housing market, for the good of communities and the 
economy. We want to achieve a balanced and resilient housing market with a high 
proportion of properties in permanent occupation, and a supply of new homes that 
meet people’s needs and maximises the delivery of affordable housing.  
Current situation  
[3.15.02] Our starting point when planning for housing is Government’s approach in  
National Parks (Circular 2010) which states that “the Parks are not suitable locations 
for unrestricted housing” and that the “expectation is that new housing will be 
focused on meeting affordable housing requirement, supporting local economy and 
key serv ices.”  
[3.15.03] There is immense pressure on the existing housing stock in many areas of 
the Lake District. This issue is due in part to those buying second homes or homes 
to be used for holiday letting purposes. Over 80 per cent of the existing housing 
stock is unfettered – houses without occupancy controls. According to the 2011 
Census, 24 per cent of the housing stock in the Lake District has no permanent 
resident. However, from local surveying we know that in some Parishes much higher 
levels exist and it is generally accepted that if the percentage of second homes is 
more than 20 per cent then the sustainability of the settlement is affected.  
[3.15.04] Earnings in many of our rural areas are lower than in neighbouring urban 
areas, due to a lack of larg e industry and greater levels of agriculture and tourism. 
This makes it difficult for people relying on local wages to compete for housing in an 
open market. The affordability ratio in the Lake District is shown in Figure 9.  
Figure 6 : Household income to house price ratio trend in the Lake District  
 
[3.15.05] The population of the Lake District is decreasing, which is seen particularly 
in the proportion of working age population. However, the older population is 
increasing and the local demographic is bec oming unbalanced. One of the greatest 
57 
 single challenges to sustaining vibrant communities in the Lake District is the 
availability of housing that a full cross -section of a balanced community should 
ordinarily be able to afford. The housing target for the delivery of new permanent 
homes has been derived following the consideration of identified local need and 
supply options. These include Strategic Housing Market Area Assessments and 
housing need studies, demographic forecasts, historic trend data on comple tions and 
proposed allocations of land.  
[3.15.06] Individuals and households who need to live in a particular area of the Lake 
District are unable to find an available and suitable house for them or cannot afford 
one – and all too often, it is both. The im pact has been most profound upon those of 
working age. Many households simply cannot secure a suitable house that is 
affordable for them in a location that meets their needs. Incomes from farming, for 
example, are typically below average earnings. If farm workers cannot afford to live 
close to their place of work, it risks the continuation of local farming practices and the 
ability to effectively operate a business is made more difficult.  
[3.15.07] The popularity of the Lake District means there is high dem and for housing, 
this drives prices up because there is a limited supply. Whilst new houses are being 
built all the time, demand outstrips supply and the Lake District’s environment simply 
cannot accommodate a level of growth that would be necessary to mee t the demand 
that exists. Currently there are no national planning controls preventing existing 
unfettered properties from being sold as a second home or used as a holiday let.  
[3.15.08] Many local people are being forced to move to another part of the cou nty 
due to the lack of suitable, affordable housing. As a result, some local communities 
are shrinking or the demographic make -up is changing. The difficulty arises when 
most of one part of a community cannot afford to live in an area, so are replaced by 
a majority of just one other sector of a community. For example, if a high proportion 
of a community is retired, this can threaten local schools, makes it difficult for 
employers to recruit and limits the number of willing volunteers to run the locals 
clubs , societies, and act as First Responders.  
[3.15.09] In some areas guest  houses are proving very difficult to sell both as a 
business and as a dwelling. The main reason suggested for this is the occupancy 
restriction that would be imposed from the change of  use. Lots of ‘For sale  ’signs can 
have a detrimental visual effect on the built environment and perceived vibrancy of 
an area, as well as resulting in a lack of longer -term investment in the built fabric of 
the neighbourhood.  
[3.15.10] It will be increasi ngly challenging to maintain a proportion of development 
on previously developed land, particularly given domestic gardens in built up areas 
are classed as greenfield, but we will seek to do this and we will monitor completion 
figures.

Policy 15: Housing  
Based on the level of identified housing need we will make provision for a minimum 
of 1,200 new permanent homes between 2020 and 2035 to increase the supply of 
homes to meet local community need.   
We will achieve this by supporting:  
1. new permanent homes that:  
 contribute towards helping communities remain vibrant and resilient; and  
 achieve a better balance in the housing market; and  
 are secured in perpetuity for permanent occupation with eligibilit y restricted to 
a geography that is tailored to local circumstances.  
2. windfall sites and allocated sites that provide one to five permanent homes  
subject to local occupancy and above that number affordable housing.  
3. rural exception sites for affordable hou sing where evidence of local need  is 
demonstrated.  
4. new permanent homes on farm holdings that:  
 support the functional need of the farm business; or  
 provide for the transition between generations and will be occupied by family 
members or rural workers; and  
59 
  are secured in perpetuity for permanent occupation with eligibility restricted to 
function or a geography that is tailored to local circumstances.  
5. permanent and transit accommodation to meet the needs of gypsy and travelling 
communities and travelling sho w people where they meet a need established by 
the Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessments.  
6. the change of use of guest  houses to dwellinghouses  where they are secured for 
permanent occupation, and where it can be demonstrated there is no detrimental 
impact on the range of visitor accommodation types in the area.  
And by not supporting open market housing.  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.15.11] T he policy covers all new housing proposals including new build, the sub - 
division of existing houses, changes of use and the conversion of traditional 
buildings. This could be housing to meet the needs of our ageing population such as 
extra care housing, h ousing options to meet the acute affordable housing need in the 
area such as shared ownership and social rented or homes for rural workers. In the 
application of this policy, we will refer to the Affordable housing definition in Annex 2: 
Glossary of the Na tional Planning Policy Framework.  
[3.15.12] The housing figure is a target not a ceiling, and is based on the number of 
completions. This policy will be applied to all applications for new permanent homes. 
A new permanent home is a new dwellinghouse that s hould be occupied as 
someone’s only or principal home. All new homes approved will be the subject of 
planning controls to ensure the future use is for permanent occupation only. We will 
not permit new homes to be used as a second home or as a holiday let u nder this 
policy.  
[3.15.13] Further guidance on the requirements for all new housing developments is 
provided in the Housing Supplementary Planning Document. For example, this 
includes details on local connection criteria, how eligibility is restricted to a 
geography and how planning controls will be applied.  
[3.15.14] Proposals for new homes and subsequent planning controls will be tailored 
to local circumstances. There is no ‘one size fits all ’implementation of Policy 15, 
instead we will consider the fun ctional characteristics of the proposed location whilst 
taking account of the broader policy context. For affordable housing we will also take 
into account information on these material considerations:  
 the percentage of dwellings not in permanent residenti al use;  
 household income to house price ratio;  
 identified housing need, informed by the latest Strategic Housing Market 
assessments and any other evidence of need in the locality.  
[3.15.15] On windfall sites and allocated sites capable of delivering more t han five 
dwellings, the first five dwellings will be subject to a local occupancy condition and 60 
 anything above that number will be on -site affordable housing reflecting the local 
community need.  
[3.15.16] We are supportive of self -build and custom housebui lding as a mechanism 
for housing delivery, as well as private house builders, Registered Providers and 
Community Land Trusts.  
[3.15.17] We do not apply a minimum density requirement to new housing 
development, but given the finite land supply we do expect new proposals to 
maximise the development opportunity. When assessing housing density, we will 
give careful consideration to the character and appearance of the locality, as well as 
having regard to the local housing need.  
[3.15.18] We will have regard to ‘Planning policy for traveller sites’(DCLG August 
2015) and the Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment when considering 
applications relating to the housing need of gypsies and travellers and travelling 
show people.  
[3.15.19] Through Policy 18 we see k to retain and evolve a range of high quality 
holiday accommodation to ensure there is a wide selection of accommodation types 
available in the locality. For proposals seeking to change the use of a guest  house to 
a permanent dwelling, the applicant will need to provide evidence to demonstrate 
that the proposal would not create a shortage of guest  houses in the locality after 
undertaking an appropriate marketing exercise for a minimum of 12 months. We will 
apply an occupancy clause through a planning condi tion to the new dwelling 
ensuring it is used as a permanent dwelling and not as a second home or holiday let. 
For those proposals where the change of use of a guest  house would result in more 
than one new house, the first would have a permanent occupancy c lause and the 
rest would serve to contribute towards meeting the identified local need and would 
have a local occupancy clause.  
[Case Study: Broadgate Orchard, Grasmere  
Architects: Croft Goode Architects An affordable housing scheme of 15 dwellings 
was cre ated on the site of a former kitchen garden in the centre of Grasmere village 
within the Conservation Area. Although traditional in form, the buildings have a 
modern design. The proposed dwellings have some traditional design elements, 
such as local slated  pitched roof and overhanging eaves; and also exhibit modern 
detailing including zinc flat roof dormers, timber panelled window surrounds, and 
larger amounts of glazing. ]   61 
 Job creation and employment space  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.16.01] Growth a nd expansion of all types of business and enterprises making 
provision for new jobs across a range of sectors. We want these sectors to diversify 
the job base and deliver higher paid jobs.  
Current situation  
[3.16.02] The Lake District’s economy is heavily influenced by tourism as the 
‘accommodation and food service activities’ and ‘wholesale and retail trade’ sectors 
both account for high levels of the Lake District’s employment and turnover. Today, 
36 per cent of employment is associated with ‘accommodatio n and food services’, 16 
per cent is associated with ‘wholesale and retail trade’, and 10 per cent is associated 
with ‘agriculture, forestry, and fishing’. The Lake District has a strong tradition of 
industry supporting its communities and generating wealt h which has had a big 
influence in shaping the Lake District’s cultural landscape. It is widely recognised 
that because of the influence of certain industries in the Lake District there is 
considerable movement of people both into and out of the Lake Distr ict for work.  
[3.16.03] As the economy, and more importantly the way people work is changing, 
the way in which the number of jobs as a ratio of floorspace also changes. Changing 
working patterns such as home working and co -working, provide significant 
oppo rtunities for the Lake District to secure a more diverse range of employment 
where businesses and employees can utilise digital infrastructure. However, 
traditional workspaces still play an important role within the Lake District and such 
spaces will still  need to be retained and created. Digital infrastructure will provide 
opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the use of these 
traditional spaces.  
[3.16.04] Competition for land is strong in many of the larger settlements in the Lake 
District with pressure from residential and visitor uses. This inevitably means that it is 
not always possible to find employment sites in all the Rural Service Centres. 
However, there are various different opportunities to provide employment space 
which ma y not fulfil traditional models of delivery. As such the location of 
employment space may not always be immediately within a settlement, particularly if 
it relates to a building conversion or reuse of a vacant site.  
[3.16.05] The earnings of people employe d in the Lake District fall below the median 
earnings of workplace and resident earnings of people in Cumbria. The working age 
of the population of the Lake District is also older than average, and the resident 
population is decreasing. Recruitment and acc ess to the labour market is an issue 
for employers in particular. This is in part as a result of low unemployment levels and 
high house prices.  62 
 Policy 16: Job creation and employment space  
Growth and expansion of all types of business and enterprises will be supported. As 
a priority we want higher paid full time jobs, and we will make provision for 2,850 
new jobs by 2035 by supporting a range of employment sectors. We will enable this 
through this policy and policies 17 and 18.  
To achieve this we will suppo rt: 
 the extension of existing employment floorspace; or  
 conversion of buildings, including the flexible use of public buildings and 
community facilities that sustains their long term viability; or  
 the redevelopment of sites to provide employment floorspace ; or 
 new build developments where they are located within or well related to a Rural 
Service Centre or Village, at existing employment sites, or on allocated sites.  
New build development in Cluster Communities and Open Countryside locations will 
be support ed where they meet the requirements of Policy 02.  
Existing land and buildings in employment use (excluding retail and tourism use) with 
a floorspace above 100 square metres or site area above 0.2 hectares, including 
allocated sites, will be retained to mai ntain employment development opportunities. 
We will only permit a change of use to a non -employment use where it can be 
demonstrated that:  
 they are unsuitable for employment uses, including other types of employment 
creating uses such as retail and tourism ; and  
 there is no demand for employment space in the locality resulting from an 
appropriate marketing exercise and other evidence; or  
 exceptionally, viable alternatives are readily available in the locality.  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.16.06] We will  encourage work hubs and other forms of innovative shared and 
flexible workspace that meets changing market expectations and requirements, and 
that appeals to younger people. We also support home based proposals, examples 
of which may include extensions, n ew build curtilage buildings, or placement of well -
designed structures that enable people to work from home.  
[3.16.07] The Lake District has limited environmental capacity to accommodate new 
development therefore it is necessary to protect employment uses.  We would expect 
an appropriate marketing exercise to have taken place for a minimum of 12 months, 
and other evidence may include, but not limited to, evidence of demand from 
commercial property agents and District Councils.  
[Case Study: Billy’s Space  
Architects: John Coward Architects  63 
 The former Duke William pub in Staveley has been redeveloped and transformed 
into seven creative workspaces, offering flexible premises to buy or rent, each with 
their own kitchens and toilets.  
Case Study: Staveley Mill Yar d 
Staveley Mill Yard hosts over 400 jobs and includes a varied selection of retail and 
industrial businesses including offices, a cafe, bakery, brewery, the UK’s largest bike 
shop, manufacturing and engineering works and is also home to artisans of many 
different crafts, including furniture workshops and artist’s studios and galleries.]  
  64 
 Retailing and town centres  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.17.01] We  aim to secure thriving town and local centres where the viability and 
vitality of town/local centres are maintained, recognising these are at the heart of the 
communities which they serve.  
Current situation  
[3.17.02] For the size of the local resident pop ulation, retail centres in the Lake 
District perform well, there are many national retailers of both comparison and 
convenience goods, a diversity of uses including shops, restaurants, cafes, public 
houses, hotels, guest houses, offices, and visitor attrac tions (leisure uses). Whilst 
the visitor economy has a significant positive effect on the number and choice of 
retail uses, and helps to support local shops and facilities, some residents consider 
that the availability of some local services such as pharma cies, post offices and 
convenience stores are lost due to competing demand to satisfy the visitor economy. 
Occupancy of units remains high, supporting vibrant town centres.  
[3.17.03] Retailing and town centre uses are focused into the settlements of 
Keswic k, Ambleside, and Windermere and Bowness, but settlements such as 
Coniston, Grasmere, Hawkshead, and Staveley do provide an important but more 
localised range of retail and town centre uses. A number of larger settlements 
outside the Lake District provide a greater retail function helping to support 
communities within the Lake District, including online ordering and home delivery but 
results in 'leakage' of expenditure.  
[3.17.04] The Glebe in Bowness Bay provides an important retail offer aimed 
primarily a t visitors, it helps to support the vibrancy of this area, and is allocated as a 
strategic regeneration site. Within this allocation some areas of the site are identified 
for retail and leisure uses to support the regeneration of this area.  
[3.17.05] The m ajority of town centre uses created over the past five years has been 
for restaurant and café use, sometimes at the expense of shops but the high street 
continues to evolve as a result of a number of factors. Changes to the Use Class 
Order provide greater flexibility for the interchange of commercial, business and 
service uses without the need for planning permission, in an effort to maintain the 
vibrancy of town/local centres against the changing demands for retail space.   
Policy 17: Retailing and town ce ntres  
We seek to support and maintain the viability and vitality of town/local centres 
recognising these are at the heart of the communities which they serve.  
Ambleside, Bowness, Keswick, Windermere  
In the Primary Shopping Areas of Ambleside, Bowness, Kesw ick, and Windermere 
we will support commercial, business and service uses where proposals maintain 
and enhance the vitality of these centres.  65 
 Outside the Primary Shopping Areas a sequential test for the location of 
development will be applied. Proposals fo r edge of centre and out of centre locations 
will only be supported where evidence demonstrates that proposals would not harm 
the vitality or viability of these shopping areas.  
Other Rural Service Centres and Villages  
In other Rural Service Centres and Vi llages (see Policy 02) we will support small 
scale commercial, business and service provision. The location of this should be well 
related to any existing retail developments or other community services.  
Other locations  
In all other locations small scale local shops, pubs and drinking establishments, 
cafes and restaurants will be permitted where they do not introduce inappropriate 
levels of use to the location, and:  
 have a demonstrable essential need for a rural location that cannot be 
accommodated elsewhe re; or  
 enable:  
- growth and expansion of an existing business, including as a component part 
of existing visitor attraction; or  
- diversification of an agricultural or land -based rural business (see Policy 19); 
or 
- retention of accessible local services.  
Everyw here  
An impact assessment will be required for all proposals containing commercial, 
business and service uses that create over 1,250 square metres (net) floorspace 
outside Primary Shopping Areas. The impact assessment requires a quantitative and 
qualitativ e assessment of existing floorspace and requirement for additional 
floorspace.  
Polic y implementation g uidance  
[3.17.06] Ambleside, Bowness, Keswick, and Windermere are the main town centres 
in the Lake District and Primary Shopping Areas are defined for t hese centres – see 
Policies Map. Outside these areas the sequential test will be appli ed in accordance 
with national g uidance.  
 [3.17.07 ] An essential need for a rural location will be determined on a case by case 
basis, using the evidence submitted in support of the application. Examples of an 
essential need for a rural location may include a village shop, or a public house that 
helps to supp ort a local community. Policy 23 provides support for the provision of 
community facilities and services that serve the needs of the community, which may 
include, for example, a village shop or public house.  
  66 
 Sustainable tourism and holiday accommodation  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.18.01] We want to secure a high quality, sustainable tourism experience for the 
diverse range of visitors to the Lake District, and ensure proposals benefit our local 
communities and businesses, whilst conserving and enhan cing the natural beauty, 
wildlife and cultural heritage of the Lake District.  
Current situation  
[3.18.02] Tourism industries are a significant contributor to the Lake District’s 
economy as a result of the millions of visitors coming every year, benefitting  many of 
its local businesses, workers and residents. Data derived from tourism modelling of 
visitors to the Lake District suggests that the economic impact and number of visitors 
coming to the Lake District is continuing to increase year on year at a rate  of about 
2.5 per cent. The number of overnight visitors as a proportion of total visitors is 
increasing, and the spread of visitors, while still dominated by the summer season, is 
increasing in the traditionally quieter months, which helps to support a mo re year 
round industry, and reduces the seasonality of jobs. There is a perception that many 
tourism related jobs are low paid and that tourism does not significantly contribute to 
creating a higher paid and skilled economy, however as with many enterprise s there 
are a range of jobs at different salary scales and skill levels within each business.  
[3.18.03] The amount of tourism related development taking place across the Lake 
District varies, with the Central Lakes being the main focus for tourism activity  but 
there are ambitions from local communities and neighbouring councils to develop 
and improve the visitor offer in the West Distinctive Area of the Lake District. 
Throughout the Lake District there has been significant increases in floorspace of 
tourism  and leisure development between 2012/13 and 2015/16 (25,000 square 
metres) – the majority coming from existing hotels, bed and breakfast, guest houses, 
and other accommodation. Such levels of development and the increasing visitor 
numbers can lead to addi tional visitor pressures on existing infrastructure resulting in 
the need for improvements.  
[3.18.04] There is continual pressure for change to the visitor accommodation 
market, as trends change, including the rise of Airbnb and glamping. This creates 
issues for less popular holiday accommodation types, and the demand to increase 
the stock of the more fashionable accommodation, including the availability of a 
range of accommodation to suit all budgets. There is significant demand for holiday 
let accommodati on which contributes to the pressure on the existing housing stock.  
Policy 18: Sustainable tourism and holiday accommodation  
We will support proposals which deliver a high quality, sustainable tourism 
experience for the diverse range of visitors to the La ke District, and ensure proposals 
benefit our local communities and businesses.  
To achieve this we will support proposals which:  67 
  enhance and improve the quality of visitor experiences; or  
 increase the length of stay of overnight visitors; or  
 encourage year  round sustainable tourism.  
Sustainable tourism proposals  
Sustainable tourism proposals will be supported where they:  
 are within or well related to the settlement form of a Rural Service Centre; or  
 contribute to the diversification of an agricultural or land-based rural business 
(Policy 19); or  
 rely upon a geographically fixed resource which justifies the development; or  
 are located within or adjacent to an existing visitor attraction or accommodation 
site. 
Holiday accommodation  
Caravan and camping (this  can include glamping, lodges, huts, tree house 
accommodation, and pods)  
Proposals for caravan and camping and any associated buildings and facilities will 
only be supported for short term holiday letting, and where:  
 the proposed development area is located on, or immediately adjacent to existing 
sites, and is consistent with the landscape character; and  
 it improves screening, including landscape recovery, and where appropriate, 
reduces the massing and site density of the existing site to the benefit of the 
amenity of the staying visitors of the existing sites; and  
 the site has necessary infrastructure capacity, it does not introduce inappropriate 
levels of use to the location, and is well related to the existing road network.  
Exceptionally, creation o f new sites will only be permitted for short term holiday 
letting, and where:  
 it contributes to the diversification of an agricultural or land -based rural business 
(Policy 19), pub or drinking establishment, and  
 the proposed development area would be appro priately screened and is 
consistent with the landscape character; and  
 the site has necessary infrastructure capacity, it does not introduce inappropriate 
levels of use to the location, and is well related to the existing road network.  
We will only permit t he loss of tented or touring caravan uses to other forms of 
caravan and camping accommodation where:  
 a good range of caravan and camping accommodation is maintained in the local 
area; and  
 the proposal would broaden the range and offer of accommodation avai lable 
through the provision of new types of holiday accommodation.  68 
 Proposals for year round occupancy on caravan and camping sites will be supported 
where they will not materially affect the character, appearance, and amenity of the 
locality, including the  local rights of way network and biodiversity.  
Hotels and guest houses  
Proposals for hotels and guest houses will be supported where they:  
 are located within or well related to a Rural Service Centre or Village; or  
 appropriately and sympathetically reuse a  building of arch aeological or historic 
interest ; or 
 are located within or adjacent to an existing visitor accommodation site; and  
 are commensurate with the level of suitable housing and dedicated 
accommodation for staff which is available locally and acc essible to the 
development by sustainable transport opportunities; and  
 do not introduce inappropriate levels of use to the location.  
We will seek to retain and evolve a range of high quality holiday accommodation. 
Proposals seeking to change guest houses t o different forms of holiday 
accommodation to meet changing market demands will be supported where a range 
of tourism accommodation is available in the local area and the relevant policy 
criteria are met.  
We will only support the change of use of holiday a ccommodation to other uses 
where it can be demo nstrated there is no demand for it resulting from an appropriate 
marketing e xercise and other evidence.  
Holiday letting  
We will only support proposals for the reuse of existing buildings (excluding guest 
house s) for short term holiday letting where they would:  
 not utilise a building that is suitable for providing local need or affordable needs 
housing; and  
 not utilise a building which is suitable for providing employment use; or  
 form part of an agricultural or land -based rural business diversification proposal 
(see Policy 19).  
New build housing for holiday use will not be supported.  
 
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.18.05] The policy aims to locate new tourism development in places w hich offer a 
choice of transport options for visitors and employees. The transport element of 
proposals will be assessed against Policy 21: Sustainable access and travel. 
Tourism proposals will be required to submit a Transport Assessment or Transport 
Statement, and Travel Plans, where appropriate.  69 
 [3.18.06] The ‘local area’  for this policy is defined as either a Rural Service Centre or 
the extent of the parish boundary for other locations.  
[3.18.07] We include lodges, pods, yurts, shepherds huts, tree hous e 
accommodation, and similar structures as well as static, touring and tented 
accommodation under the term ‘caravan and camping’.  
[3.18.08] Under the caravan and camping part of the policy ‘pub or drinking 
establishment’  is expected to include rural pubs o r inns. It is not anticipated that this 
would include pubs or other drinking establishments within Rural Service Centres 
unless it can be demonstrated that it will not result in inappropriate levels of use or 
amenity issues, including to the staying visito r. 
[3.18.09] The increased activity on caravan and camping sites seeking year round 
use will result in additional pressure on surrounding infrastructure will be considered 
as to whether they should expected to contribute to improved infrastructure provisio n 
under Policy 08: Infrastructure and developer contributions.  
[3.18.10] For the change of use of holiday accommodation to other uses we would 
expect an appropriate marketing exercise to have taken place for a minimum of 12 
months, and other evidence may i nclude, but not limited to, evidence of demand 
from commercial property agents and District Councils.  
[3.18.11] Proposals for new hotel and guest house accommodation, including 
extensions, will need to consider the amount of employment the proposal will cr eate 
and whether there is likely to be sufficient accommodation available locally or easily 
accessible via sustainable transport to meet staffing requirements. Where this may 
not be the case applicants should consider and incorporate the provision of an 
appropriate level of staff accommodation within the development proposal.

of vessels. A wet dock will allow the display of boats on water within the museum. 
The redevelopment of the site was part of the Windermere Waterfront Programm e – 
a strategic programme with wider aspirations to provide a World Class visitor 
experience around Windermere, the lake.]   70 
 Agricultural and land -based rural business diversification  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.19.01] Farming is an essential part of the Lake District. We seek to ensure it has a 
future by supporting agricultural and land -based rural businesses to diversify to help 
sustain the rural economy, the Special Qualities and attributes of Outstanding 
Universal Value, and maintain the character of the landscape and environment.  
Current situation  
[3.19.02] There are approximately 1,160 commercial holdings in the Lake District 
employing in the region of 2,600 people according to the latest (2017) Department of 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Ju ne Survey of Agriculture & Horticulture. 
Further research by Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs identifies 
that approximately 60 per cent of farm businesses across the country engage in 
other activities in addition to those carried out on th eir own farm and that of the 
32,500 farms that have diversified the average diversified enterprise income was 
£15,200. Forestry and estate management are also important land -based rural 
sectors which help to sustain the character of the Lake District and m ay require 
diversified enterprises to help support these businesses.  
[3.19.03] The average income from farming enterprises is low in comparison to other 
industries. And the income from farming is unpredictable, easily affected by currency 
exchange rates, a nd supply and demand factors. The uncertainty over the future of 
farming and Brexit means diversification of agricultural businesses can help to 
sustain existing businesses by providing more predictable revenue streams, 
however, diversification generally r equires significant investment and commitment to 
a long payback period.  
Policy 19: Agricultural and land -based rural business 
diversification  
We want diversification proposals for agricultural and land based rural businesses to 
help sustain the rural econo my and communities, and the character of the landscape 
and environment.  
Agricultural businesses  
To achieve this we will support proposals that demonstrate sustainable practices and 
outcomes, and where they:  
 sustain the long term operation of the farm business; and  
 do not compromise the working of the farm business; and  
 are located within or well related to existing building groups; or  
 are a small -scale renewable or low carbon energy scheme.  
Privately managed estates  71 
 Diversification proposals on private ly managed estates will be supported where a 
proposal demonstrates sustainable practices and outcomes, and is in accordance 
with an up to date endorsed Whole Estate Plan that delivers and secures multiple 
wider public benefits such as employment and enterp rise opportunities, sustainable 
access, social and cultural facilities, environmental enhancements, conserving and 
enhancing heritage assets, and improvements to land management.  
Forestry  
Small -scale diversification proposals for forestry businesses will b e supported where 
a proposal demonstrates sustainable practices and outcomes, sustains the long term 
operation of the business and secures multiple wider public and environmental 
benefits.  
 
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.19.04] The purpose of this polic y is to support the long term sustainability of 
farming, forestry and privately managed estates to protect and sustain the 
contribution they make to the authenticity of the Special Qualities and attributes of 
Outstanding Universal Value. Where the proposal  involves the use of buildings, 
priority will first be given to the reuse or extension of existing buildings. Where new 
or replacement buildings are required they should be closely related to existing 
building groups. To ensure proposal for new development  do not compromise the 
working of the farm business we will not support the piecemeal stripping of assets 
from farms without regard for the overall viability of farm holdings.  
[3.19.05] Whole Estate Plan are a document prepared by individual land owning 
estates. They set out the assets of the estate and the opportunities and threats 
which the estate may encounter, and describes their plans for the future. A Whole 
Estate Plan should include environmental and social assets, public benefits, and 
issues as well  as economic development projects. An endorsed Whole Estate Plan 
will be a material consideration in determining planning applications and will provide 
a solid understood contextual background to any development proposals. The 
inclusion of a development pr oposal within a Whole Estate Plan however does not 
guarantee that planning permission will be granted and any proposal will still need to 
comply with relevant development plan policies.  
  72 
 Renewable and low carbon energy  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.20 .01] We want to increase the proportion of energy generated by renewable and 
low carbon sources and encourage energy provision from local scale generation, 
supporting a Low Carbon Lake District.  
Current situation  
[3.20.02] The Local Plan has a key role to play in reducing carbon emissions in the 
Lake District. One of the ways to achieve this is to increase the proportion of 
renewable and low carbon energy generated within the Lake District. The UK 
Climate Change Act 2008 establishes a legally binding target  for an 80 per cent 
reduction in the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Low Carbon Lake 
District Initiative has set a target to reduce carbon emissions by 1 per cent year on 
year, measured on an annual basis through the Lake District’s Carbon Budge t. 
Renewable and low carbon energy development helps to facilitate resilience to 
climate change, improve local scale energy generation and reduce carbon emissions 
to meet the Carbon Budget.  
[3.20.03] The Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA) report,  ‘Planning for 
the Climate Challenge?’(2016) identified that ‘local plans are not delivering on the 
basic standards set out in national law and policy for either mitigation or adaptation’. 
Requiring a target for on -site renewable energy from new developmen ts is one of the 
areas the Lake District is taking a lead, as this recent report states that a target for 
emissions reductions should be set in reference to local circumstances.  
[3.20.04] The Lake District has an abundance of natural resources that we can  use 
to generate low carbon and renewable energy. Due to the topography and climate 
condition of the Lake District there is potential for hydro generation at high -head 
sites. Woodfuel is particularly suitable given the large areas of woodland. Energy 
from air and ground source heat pumps, solar and wind can also make a contribution 
to increasing power from low carbon energy sources.  
 Policy 20: Renewable and low carb on energy  
We want to increase the proportion of energy generated by renewable and low 
carbo n sources and encourage energy provision from local scale generation.  
We will achieve this by:  
 supporting district heating, decentralised, renewable and low carbon energy 
developments, including buildings or infrastructure directly related to the 
renewabl e energy proposal; and  
 requiring all new housing developments and all new developments for other uses 
of 100sqm floorspace or more to generate 30 per cent of their operational energy 
requirements through decentralised, district heating and, renewable and l ow-
carbon energy sources.  73 
 When assessing proposals for decentralised or renewable energy schemes, we will 
take into account the cumulative impacts both within the Lake District and that which 
is visible beyond its boundary.  
Where the requirements of the Policy are deemed to make a development unfeasible 
or unviable this must be demonstrated by the applicant through an independent 
viability assessment  
 
Policy implementation g uidance  
[3.20.05] This  policy supports all forms of renewable and low carbon energy, for 
example, hydro -power schemes, air and ground source heat pumps and energy 
storage proposals. The proposals would have to take into account the impact on the 
landscape and other environmenta l considerations in line with the other policies in 
this document. In some cases an environmental appraisal may be required to assess 
and mitigate any adverse impacts on the natural environment.  
[3.20.06] We will have regard to the Cumbria Wind Energy Supp lementary Planning 
Document when assessing wind energy developments. There is a presumption 
against large scale wind energy development in the Lake District, as schemes of this 
scale will be incompatible with the objectives of National Park designation. Ho wever, 
the landscape in some parts of the Lake District may have capacity for small scale 
wind energy schemes without adversely affecting the landscape character or other 
Special Qualities. The whole of the Lake District has been identified as suitable for  
small scale wind energy development subject to meeting the criteria set out in other 
policies in the Local Plan. We will assess renewable energy proposals in accordance 
with the Lake District National Park Landscape Character Assessment. When we 
assess pr oposals for wind energy proposals and both ground and roof mounted solar 
arrays we will take account of the cumulative impacts both within the Lake District 
and those which are visible beyond its boundary.  
[3.20.07] Applicants will be required to submit an  Energy Statement with their 
planning application that outlines how they will generate 30 per cent of the 
development’s energy requirements. The practice guidance note gives further details 
on how to prepare an Energy Statement.  
[3.20.08] Evidence demonstr ates the 30 per cent target is achievable for generating 
a development’s energy requirements from renewable and low carbon sources. The 
‘Evidence Report and Case Studies on Renewable Energy Targets in New 
Developments’ concluded that a target of 30 per cen t is easily achievable for most 
types of development if the heating and hot water requirements for a development 
are met through renewable and low carbon sources, for example, an air source or 
ground source heat pump or biomass boiler. Where electricity is  available as the only 
energy source, more than one technology is likely be required to meet the energy 
requirements. For larger developments, the requirement could be met through 
district heating and decentralised energy schemes from renewable and low car bon 74 
 sources. These can be installed where technically viable and in areas with sufficient 
existing or potential heat density.  
[3.20.09] If the development proposal is a conversion of an existing building then 
consideration will be given to the character a nd historic significance of the building. 
In some circumstances the character of a building may outweigh the need to meet 
30 per cent of its operation energy requirements through renewable and low carbon 
energy sources.  
[3.20.10] If the proposal is for an extension then 30 per cent of the new structure’s 
energy requirements will have to be generated through renewable and low carbon 
energy sources. However, this could represent an opportunity to take a holistic 
review of a building’s energy requirements to m ake savings and consider alternative 
energy sources. Agricultural buildings do not generally have any significant energy 
requirements so we will not apply this target to them.  
  75 
 Sustainable access and travel  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.21.01] We want  to reduce the need to travel by private vehicles for visitors within 
and through the Lake District, and promote the development and use of sustainable 
transport and travel choices.  
Current situation  
[3.21.02] The Lake District is an area of low resident p opulation (approximately 
40,000) and high visitor numbers (approximately 19 million) which creates 
challenges and opportunities for the transport network. Currently, approximately 86 
per cent of visitors travel to the Lake District by car, van, motorbike o r motorhome 
and this increase puts pressure on the highway network and parking facilities. 
However, it has been shown through recent projects that if suitable infrastructure and 
services are available, many visitors will switch to more sustainable ways of 
travelling.  
[3.21.03] The planning process is crucial in helping to achieve more sustainable 
travel patterns that will help achieve a modal shift away from the car and towards 
both public transport (bus, rail, coach and boat) and active travel such as cycl ing and 
walking, in order to reduce carbon and improve the environment for both visitors and 
residents. Whilst there are limited bus and rail services in some areas due to the 
rural nature of the Lake District, there are also numerous opportunities for mor e 
innovative travel solutions that take advantage of the Lake District’s features, such 
as lake based transport, multi - user trails, and fleets of electric vehicles. The Lake 
District National Park Partnership’s Plan 2015 –2020 develops the ambition to 
enco urage greater use of sustainable ways of travelling. It incorporates strategies 
and Visitor Movement Maps (Figures 11 –14) which set out the approach to visitor 
movement. They identify travel approaches, gateways, corridors and hubs within the 
Lake District . We have developed a revised visitor travel vision ‘Smarter Travel: A 
vision for smarter travel in the Lake District 2018 –2040’which builds on the strategy 
for movement outlined in the Partnership’s Plan.  
[3.21.04] Provision of public transport varies by  area, with the popular visitor 
destinations in the South East and Central Lake District having high levels of bus 
services, water transport and rail services. The less populated and less frequently 
visited valleys have poorer public transport, but more po tential for cycling on their 
relatively quiet roads. We recognise that cars will continue to be the most practical 
option for some journeys; it is extremely difficult to imagine the Lake District 
functioning without people using cars. But the car certainly  does not need to 
dominate the experience of the visitor. The intention is to create the conditions 
whereby visitors and residents can travel to and around the Lake District by 
sustainable means.  
[3.21.05] Visitor numbers are expected to continue to increa se, yet to encourage a 
corresponding increase in traffic and parking would impact negatively on residents, 
visitors and the landscape.  76 
 Policy 21: Sustainable access and travel  
We will support the development of sustainable transport infrastructure to broad en 
and encourage use of sustainable travel modes for visitors thereby reducing the 
need to travel by private vehicle.  
We will achieve this by supporting:  
 proposals for sustainable transport infrastructure and facilities which improve the 
connectivity of existing and new sustainable transport infrastructure, services and 
networks; or  
 proposals which improve water based transport through the provision of public 
jetties and connecting infrastructure; or  
 proposals that enable deployment of new transport and i nfrastructure 
technologies in travel corridors; or  
 proposals that enable the provision of new modes of transport and mobility 
services.  
We will safeguard the rights of way network, and other cycle and walking routes from 
development that would compromise their use.  
We will safeguard the operational Oxenholme to Windermere railway line and 
support proposals for infrastructure improvements to the line.  
It is our aspiration to use disused rail track beds to widen sustainable transport 
choices where there is a  realistic prospect of an alternative sustainable transport 
solution being delivered which supports the reduction in private car use. To achieve 
this there will be a presumption against other development which could compromise 
the future reuse of disused r ail track beds for sustainable transport infrastructure, 
unless robust evidence demonstrates that there is no realistic prospect of a 
sustainable transport use.  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.21.06] The types of sustainable transport infrastructure and facilities that may be 
appropriate may include - public jetties, stations and interchanges, park and ride/ 
walk/cycle/sail facilities, visitor information, bus shelters, cycle hire, public realm 
improvements, multi user trails, electric vehicle charge poin ts, digital information 
boards, real time service information, changing facilities and lockers, and showers. 
Some of these proposals will be identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan and 
Figures 8 -10. 
[3.21.07] Water based travel may include motorised  and non -motorised travel. The 
Local Plan cannot establish navigable rights for motorised travel on lakes and this 
would have to be established through relevant legislation.  
[3.21.08] Examples of technologies that have enabled the provision of new modes of  
transport and mobility services in recent years include electric vehicle charge points 
for electric vehicles and bikes, use of technology for real time information such as 77 
 digital car parking space availability from the highway, integrated ticketing betwe en 
different forms of travel, and/or attractions, and cycle route information.  
[3.21.09] Where a development proposal would harm the rights of way network and 
other cycle and walking routes we would refuse permission unless we could ensure 
there would be n o loss of use, and where possible seek opportunities to enhance 
provision.  
[3.21.10] The only identified disused rail track beds in the Lake District which could 
provide alternative sustainable transport choices are the Penrith to Keswick line and 
parts of  the Foxfield to Coniston line.  
[3.21.11] We would anticipate robust evidence, such as a feasibility study, to have 
been prepared or be under preparation by the next Local Plan Review (i.e. five years 
from adoption) to ensure safeguarding of this disused r ail track bed in the future.

 Vehicle parking to improve sustainable transport  
What  are we trying to achieve?  
[3.22.01] We want fewer visitors arriving to and moving around the Lake District by 
private vehicle. We want people to park their vehicle for the day and use sustainable 
travel opportunities if they arrive in a private vehicle, t o reduce visitor movement 
pressures and pollution.  
Current situation  
[3.22.02] The provision of car parking is a controversial and critical issue in the Lake 
District. It is unsurprising that the demand for car parking is concentrated to times 
when visitor  demand to come to the Lake District is at its highest – school holidays, 
weekends, bank holidays, and this is even more prevalent when the weather is good 
as more day visitors are attracted. There are many different types of car parking in 
the Lake Distri ct including on -street parking, off -street public parking in car parks, 
customer parking at visitor attractions, visitor accommodation parking, residential 
private parking, businesses customer and staff parking, and parking at retail units for 
customers an d staff.  
[3.22.03] We seek to reduce the need to travel by private vehicle to support climate 
change initiatives like the ‘Low Carbon Lake District’ project and address visitor 
pressure at peak times. We recognise opportunities are limited by the availabil ity of 
public transport services, and by people’s behavioural habits. In the short to medium 
term we therefore recognise that the majority of people will continue to arrive by 
private vehicle. There is a strong case that we need to provide car parking as p art of 
sustainable transport measures given the number of people arriving to the Lake 
District by private motor vehicle. The transition from car to sustainable transport 
needs to be easy and convenient, and the offer for sustainable transport has to be 
attractive to the user. Parking is also required to support the local economy — 
particularly in town centres/ retail areas.  
[3.22.04] Coach travel is a sustainable form of transport (based on carbon emissions 
per passenger) and is a significant part of the ov erseas visitor market. It is therefore 
important that there is coach parking available to enable and encourage this form of 
travel. There are currently 14 sites that provide coach parking and they provide 98 
spaces, and there is a lack of coach parking in some locations.  
[3.22.05] There are many public car parks spread throughout the Lake District 
providing in the region of 7,300 public car parking spaces. However, we estimate 
that there could be at least 8,000 ‘on -street’ spaces either in disc zones, in 
settlements and in other rural areas. There is also a considerable number of 
customer parking spaces associated with businesses including shops, visitor 
attractions or accommodation. On a single day in the school holidays there might be 
75,000 –100,000 visito rs in the Lake District (82 per cent of whom may be day 
visitors and it is estimated 83 per cent of visitors arrive by private motor vehicle). 
Therefore there could be in the region of 17,000 –22,000 visitors’ vehicles (if 
travelling as a family in a single  car) moving around the Lake District. It is inevitable 82 
 that demand for parking can exceed supply at peak times. Fly -parking is an issue 
such as at peak times and/or because of parking charges and this can affect 
landscape, safety and access for residents.  Temporary parking which can provide 
additional capacity for up to 28 days often is not considered to be long enough to 
cover the peak season.  
Policy 22: Vehicle parking to improve sustainable transport   
We will only support additional public parking prov ision that helps to reduce the need 
to travel by private motor vehicle, and contributes to and improves sustainable 
transport and movement opportunities.  
We will achieve this by permitting:  
1. additional public car parking at Transport Interchanges, Gateways,  or Rural 
Service Centres which function as Multi -Purpose Hubs (Figures 11 –14), only 
where evidence demonstrates it is needed and it:  
 facilitates the transfer of people to sustainable transport and travel 
opportunities; and  
 links to or incorporates and imp roves links to existing sustainable travel 
opportunities secured where necessary by developer contributions; and  
 encourages long stay parking; and  
 does not introduce inappropriate levels of use to the location.  
2. additional public car parking at existing man aged attractions or businesses only 
where evidence demonstrates it is needed and where the applicant can 
demonstrate the proposal would deliver a modal shift in visitor travel by 
connecting with regular and scheduled public transport, ferry, boat services,  or 
other forms of sustainable movement of people. Proposals must not introduce 
inappropriate levels of use to the location. We would normally expect 
improvements to sustainable transport to deliver this modal shift, including to 
walking and cycling infras tructure, and secured where necessary by developer 
contributions.  
3. additional coach parking within Rural Service Centres and Travel Corridors, and 
at managed visitor attractions and accommodation where the local highway 
network can safely accommodate additi onal coaches.  
Exceptionally, public car parking proposals in locations other than those set out in 1 
and 2 will only be permitted where it is demonstrated that proposals would:  
 resolve an unacceptable highway safety issue or hazard and all other relevant 
regulatory measures and enforcement have been exhausted; and  
 form part of a traffic management plan that integrates with other sustainable 
transport opportunities to manage traffic, secured where necessary by developer 
contributions, and would not lead to n et increases in traffic accessing the location 
where it is proposed; and  
 not introduce inappropriate levels of use to the location; and  83 
  incorporate specific measures to manage traffic to the site through ‘smart’ parking 
information where such measures are appropriate in terms of scale of parking 
and are viable.  
Polic y implementation guid ance  
[3.22.06] This Policy only applies to the provision of new public parking, including 
extensions to existing. It does not apply to new development proposals which will 
require specific standards of parking provision, such are residential developments, 
employment sites, retail, tourism attractions, or hotels and guest accommodation. It 
also does not apply to extensions to customer only parking or staff parking. Policy 
08: Infrastructure and developer contributions, and The Cumbria Development 
Design Guide will be used to inform required parking standards.  
[3.22.07] Public car parking may be permanent or temporary. All proposals, whether 
permanent or temporary will be expected to meet the criteria identified in this policy, 
however temporary proposals may be considered more favourably if it would result in 
less landscape and environmental harm. A Travel Plan will be required for additional 
parking proposals to demonstra te how the development will transfer people to 
sustainable transport and travel opportunities.  
[3.22.08] Visitor Movement Maps (Figures 11 –14) identify settlements that are 
Transport Interchanges, Gateways, and Rural Service Centres which function as 
multi -purpose hubs. These settlements are: Ambleside, Bowness on Windermere, 
Broughton in Furness, Caldbeck, Coniston, Glenridding, Gosforth, Grasmere, 
Greenodd, Hawkshead, Keswick, Newby Bridge, Pooley Bridge, Ravenglass, 
Staveley, and Windermere.  
[3.22.10] Ev idence of need for additional public parking may include, but not be 
limited to:  
 the capacity and occupancy of all existing car and coach parks and parking 
spaces in the settlement/ relevant area;  
 the average length of stay in existing car and coach parks ; 
 the need for additional parking all year round;  
 highway safety issues;  
 traffic volume trends;  
 highways authority and/or police have provided evidence of substantial 
enforcement action and activity for at least a 12 month period; or  
 other evidence as deem ed appropriate.  
[3.22.11] Each parking application will have different opportunities and local 
circumstances, including existing transport. Linking cycle and walking route potential, 
and user benefits will be taken into account. We will require applicants to implement 
measures to support the modal shift from cars to other forms of sustainable travel. 
These may include:  84 
  tariffs to encourage long stay and joint ticketing with public transport and/or cycle 
hire, such as Park and Explore;  
 information and market ing on sustainable modes of transport from the car park; 
improvements to public realm, safety and environment at car park, surrounding 
areas and/or waiting facilities;  
 new secure cycle parking;  
 provision of electric vehicle and e -bike charge points;  
 creati on or improvements to walking and cycle routes;  
 water transport infrastructure improvements, such as new public jetties; 
consideration of roadside parking restrictions;  
 improvements to public or community transport services;  
 provide visitor incentives for  arriving by sustainable means;  
 be a component of a park and ride scheme;  
 designated coach parking provision;  
 bus stops and associated infrastructure; or  
 investment in ‘smart’ technology that gives advanced information and helps to 
manage car park demand.

 Community facilities and Local Green Space  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.23.01] We aim to provide the social, recreational and cultural facilities and 
services our communities need to support healthy lifestyles and address identified 
local health and well -being needs.  
Current situation  
[3.23.02] Within the Lake District there are over 3000km of right s of way. There is 
also 1,246sq km of open access land combining Common Land, Open Access and 
Dedicated land under the CROW Act 2000. The Authority’s ‘Miles without St iles’ 
Initiative helps those with limited mobility to access the countryside by providing 
suitable paths, and there are currently 48 routes across the Lake District (2018). 
There are 1.37 sqkm (136.6ha) of Amenity Local Green Space and 1.16sqkm 
(116.1ha) of  Recreation Local Green Space allocated primarily in the Rural Service 
Centres and Villages. We acknowledge the multi -functional benefits open space to 
both people and nature. However, we do not consider it necessary to safeguard all 
open space in the Lake  District, instead we safeguard Recreation Local Green 
Space  and Amenity Local Green Space.  The policies in the Local Plan serve to 
collectively conserve and enhance the extraordinary beauty and harmony of the 
Lake District landscape and wildlife and help facilitate opportunities for communities 
to benefit physically and mentally. When coupled with the approaches set out in the 
National Planning Policy Framework provides adequate protection.  
[3.23.03] The Open Spaces Audit 2020 identifies deficiencies in re creation local 
green space in some areas of the Lake District. We designated Local Green Spaces 
in 2013, this designation provides special protection against development of green 
areas of particular importance to local communities.  
[3.23.04] Approximately  94 per cent of the settlements identified in Policy 02: Spatial 
Strategy have retained access to at least four or more local services as identified in 
the Annual Monitoring Report 2017 –2018. Many of our communities face difficulties 
in providing and retai ning services and community facilities. The impact of second 
homes and holiday lets in the Lake District means that settlements often have 
dwindling resident populations which threatens the viability of local schools, 
healthcare and other facilities such a s public houses. Mobile service provision such 
as the post office, banking services, supermarket delivery, and prescription delivery 
remain increasingly important for rural communities to maintain access to essential 
services. Approximately 94 per cent of the settlements identified in Policy 02: Spatial 
Strategy have retained access to at least four or more local services as identified in 
the Annual Monitoring Report 2017 –2018.  
Policy 23: Community facilities and Local Green Sp ace 
We want to sustain communi ty and cultural facilities and local services, and ensure 
communities have improved availability and access to high quality greenspaces and 
recreation facilities.  88 
 We will achieve this by:  
1. supporting development proposals for new, or improvements to existin g 
community facilities and services where they are appropriately located to serve 
the needs of the community.  
2. supporting development proposals that enable flexible / multi -use of buildings or 
that combine a range of services and facilities on one site to s ustain its long term 
viability.  
3. resisting the change of use of existing shops, and pubs and drinking 
establishments to alternative uses outside Primary Shopping Areas unless:  
 the current use is no longer suitable or viable for its purpose; or  
 it can be dem onstrated that there are suitable alternatives within the 
settlement.  
4. only permitting the loss of a Local Green Space designation in special 
circumstances where:  
 it can be demonstrated that the green space is no longer needed, or  
 a suitably located replace ment of at least equivalent standard is secured.  
5. requiring new housing development of ten houses and above and new business 
parks, large -scale retail and commercial developments (over 1250sqm) to include 
Amenity Local Green Space to enhance amenity value.  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.23.05] We will resist the loss of a community facility or significant erosion of the 
viability or quality of a community facility. We will only support the loss of a 
community facility to other uses where there is compell ing justification. Proposals of 
this nature will be rigorously tested, such as an appropriate marketing exercise to 
have taken place for a minimum of 12 months. Other evidence may include, but not 
limited to, evidence of demand from commercial property age nts and District 
Councils.  
[3.23.06] New sports and recreation facilities will be considered against evidence of 
need, guidance for which is provided by Sport England. The Local Green Space 
designation is identified on the Policies Map. Proposals which wo uld result in the 
loss of a Local Green Space designation should include clear justification as to why 
the designation is surplus to requirements. This should demonstrate why the Local 
Green Space no longer holds a particular local significance, such as, o f its beauty, 
historic significance, landscape setting, recreational value, tranquillity or richness of 
its wildlife. This could also show there is an excess of playing field provision, which 
will remain the case should the development be permitted.  
[3.23 .07] Applications for new or improved communications infrastructure will be 
assessed against the National Planning Policy Framework and associated guidance.  
  89 
 Lakeshore development  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.24.01] We want to protect the landscape a nd character of lakes and lakeshores 
from inappropriate development.  
What is the issue?  
[3.24.02] Lakes are a key feature of the Lake District landscape and we want to 
protect lakes and lakeshores from inappropriate development. However, we 
recognise that there are some developments that require a lakeshore location.  
[3.24.03] The attractiveness of lakeshore sites means that there is significant 
development pressure on lakeshores which are vulnerable to disturbance, pollution 
and the direct impact of develo pment activities. Demand for lakeshore development 
is higher on some lakes than others, particularly those lakes that are adjacent to 
settlements or that are popular for recreational activities.  
Policy 24: Lakeshore development  
We want to protect the lands cape and character of lakes and lakeshores.  
We will only permit lakeshore development where:  
 the development provides facilities or services that have a direct lake use 
function for recreation or water -based transport purposes; and  
 the applicant demonstrat es that alternative non -lakeshore solutions are not 
feasible or viable; and  
 the scale, siting, and design of the development enhances or maintains the 
character of the lake and its lakeshore location, including undeveloped stretches 
of lakeshore; and  
 the d evelopment does not have an adverse impact on lake navigation; and  
 the development does not have an adverse impact on lake water quality.  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.24.04] Each lake and lakeshore has a different landscape character and level of 
use, and we will consider these issues when making any development decisions. We 
will use the Lake District Landscape Character Assessment to inform decisions on 
applications for lakeshore development.  
[3.24.05] There is pressure on some lakes for boathouse development. The 
cumulative effects of increasing numbers of boathouses can adversely impact on 
lakeshore character. When assessing proposals for lakeshore development, we will 
consider the scale, siting and the cumulative impacts of the development on 
lakeshore character.  
[3.24.06] Proposals should consider how the effects of high and low water levels 
would affect the development and adaptation measures that have been put in place 
to ensure resilience to these effects. Low water levels, exacerbated by fur ther draw 90 
 down at times of drought, will affect the economic functioning of some lakes, 
particularly Windermere. At times of draw down, the infrastructure of jetties, slipways 
and moorings on lakes are placed at risk, not being able to perform as designed.  By 
considering high and low water levels at the planning application stage we can 
ensure development is resilient to the effects of climate change.  
[3.24.07] The water quality of the lake is an important aspect of its character as over 
enrichment with nut rients can cause long term changes in the visual appearance of 
the lakes. Many of the lakeshore areas are not served by public sewer so any new 
development would need to be served by individual sewage treatment plants. These 
are less effective at controlli ng nutrient inputs into the lake than United Utilities’ 
sewage treatment works therefore applicants should demonstrate how the 
development will not affect water quality. Any lakeshore development may require a 
Construction Management Plan to demonstrate th e measures to avoid water 
pollution during construction.  
  91 
 Development for the keeping of animals on a non -commercial basis  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.25.01] We  want to maintain the character and cultural landscape associated with 
the unique farming heritage of the Lake District and ensure that facilities related to 
keeping of animals on a non -commercial basis do not harm the character of the 
cultural landscape.  
Current situation  
[3.25.02] Horses have been kept in the Lake District for centuries for both working 
and recreation use. There are semi -feral herds of Fell Ponies that are associated 
particularly with farms and they form an important part of the cultural heritage of the 
Lake District. The majority of horses are now kept for recreational purposes, and the 
use of land for keeping horses is a relatively common feature in the Lake District 
particularly on the edge of settlements where individual or a small num ber of horses 
are kept in a field. There are limited economic benefits associated with such small -
scale equestrian activities of this type. It is also becoming increasingly common to 
see other livestock being kept on a non -commercial basis, such as llamas and 
alpacas. Similarly there are limited economic benefits, yet potential for negative 
impacts resulting from buildings and structures required. There are very few 
commercial establishments such as liveries, commercial/ racing stables, or 
equestrian centre s, however, these do contribute to the rural economy and help to 
sustain it.  
[3.25.03] New facilities can have a negative impact on the rural nature of the Lake 
District by adversely affecting its landscape character and natural beauty by virtue of 
their a ppearance, scale, materials or design. Individually such developments may 
seem inconsequential, but cumulatively over time they can significantly alter the 
character of an area and the nature and structure of farming as smaller parcels of 
more productive l and are bought for non -commercial agricultural use.  
Policy 25: Development for the keeping of animals on a non -
commercial basis  
We want to maintain the character and cultural landscape associated with the unique 
farming heritage of the Lake District.  
Devel opment of facilities related to the keeping of animals which are kept on a non -
commercial basis will only be supported where:  
 it reuses an existing building; or  
 it is well related to existing buildings and structures and they satisfactorily relate 
to exist ing vehicular access and bridleways.  
Where this is not practical or appropriate, exceptionally, we will only permit buildings 
in open countryside locations where they are demonstrably necessary for and 
designed for welfare reasons.  92 
 All developments must b e well integrated with their surroundings taking advantage of 
the natural landform and any existing natural screening.  
Where planning permission is granted for the change of use of land for the keeping 
of horses and ponies relevant conditions will be impos ed in order to retain the natural 
character of the field.  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.25.04] Facilities may include field shelters, stables, schooling areas and outdoor 
exercise arenas. Development should reinforce the importance of local character b y 
having regard to scale, height, density, layout, appearance and materials (Policy 06). 
In the first instance we will seek to support development that reuses an existing 
building.  
[3.25.05] The natural character of the field is considered to be the state of the land 
prior to development. In most cases this will be an agricultural field used for grazing 
livestock without development and infrastructure associated with development such 
as hardstandings or associated equipment.  
  93 
 Major Development  
What are we trying to achieve  
[3.26.01] We continue to support Government’s view that National Parks are not the 
place for Major Development except in the most exceptional circumstances. We 
want to ensure that if these exceptional circumstances are demonstrated in the  Lake 
District then all possible measures to minimise adverse effects are secured.  
Current situation  
[3.26.02] National policy states that planning permission should be refused for major 
development in designated areas other than in exceptional circumstanc es, and 
where it can be demonstrated that the development is in the public interest. National 
policy and guidance provides the criteria to determine whether the exceptional 
circumstances and public interest can be demonstrated.  
[3.26.03] Examples of major  development proposals may include road schemes, 
pipelines and tunnels, energy supply schemes (conventional, nuclear or large scale 
renewable), high voltage electricity transmission schemes, water supply schemes 
and reservoirs, large scale tourism or leisu re schemes, or proposals for major new 
waste disposal or management facilities (including those for nuclear waste). 
However, smaller -scale proposals may also be considered to be major development 
depending on the local context as determined by the nature, scale and setting of a 
proposal . 
Policy 26: Major development  
Proposals for major development will be refused except in exceptional 
circumstances and where it can be demonstrated that they are in the public interest.  
Whether a proposal constitutes major development will be determined by reason of 
the proposal’s nature, scale and setting, and whether it has the potential to have a 
significant adverse impact on the National Park’s statutory purposes.  
Exceptional circums tances and whether the development is in the public interest will 
be determined in accordance with the criteria outlined in national policy and 
guidance for major development.  
Where these criteria can be satisfied all possible measures should be taken to avoid 
adverse effects on the Special Qualities and attributes of Outstanding Universal 
Value of the Lake District.  Where adverse impacts cannot be avoided , harm should 
be minimised through appropriate mitigation measures. Appropriate and practicable 
compe nsation will be required for any unavoidable adverse effects which cannot be 
mitigated.  
When the activity for which major development is required ceases the land will be 
required to be appropriately restored or enhanced.  
 94 
 Policy implementation guidance  
[3.26.04] We will determine what constitutes major development in accordance with 
national planning policy and guidance.  We will consider:  
 nature;  
 scale;  
 setting, and  
 whether the proposal has the potential to have a significant adverse impact on 
the purpose s for which the Lake District has been designated  
Our assessment will draw upon evidence relating to (but not limited to):  
 Size and capacity of the site ; 
 Settlement profiles, such as the housing stock information and employment land 
information;  
 Landscape character and sensitivity to accommodate development, such as 
Landscape Character Assessments, Landscape and Visual Impact Assessments;  
 Settlement character, such as Conservation Area Appraisals, World Heritage 
Nomination Dossier;  
 Rights of Way Network;  
 Habitat surveys, such as Phase 1 Habitat Surveys;  
 Whether the development is Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
development;  
 Whether developments that fall within Schedule 2 of the EIA Regulations after 
being screened by the Authority, are considered as likely to have significant 
effects on the environment due to their nature, scale and setting and require an 
assessment .  
[3.26.05] A balanced judgement will be made to determine whether exceptional 
circumstances exist and whether the development would be i n the public interest.  
[3.26.06] The need for assessments to consider the exceptional circumstances and 
public interest of a proposal will be determined by national policy requirements and 
guidance.  
  95 
 Mineral extraction  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.27.01] We will support the extraction of building stone and slate where this is 
principally needed to maintain the Special Quality of ‘distinctive buildings and 
settlement character’ and attributes of Outstanding Universal Value. And high value 
industri al limestone where it is necessary to support manufacturing processes of 
local and national importance.  
Current situation  
[3.27.02] The Lake District, in common with other scenically attractive upland areas, 
has a diverse geology and is rich in a variety o f mineral deposits. Underground 
mining for a range of minerals including lead, copper, graphite and tungsten, began 
in the late sixteenth century. Slate quarrying, which is of particular importance, has 
also taken place for centuries, originally as undergr ound workings but more recently 
as surface workings. The extensive use and distinctive character of local slate for 
roofing is a unifying feature in the Lake District. High purity limestone, produced at 
Shap Beck Quarry, is nationally significant and is ne cessary to support industrial 
processes of local and national importance, particularly in steel manufacture.  
[3.27.03] Mineral production is now more limited and is concentrated upon slate, 
building stone and aggregates. There are:  
 nine active building st one quarries;  
 three active and one inactive hard rock quarries providing limestone, igneous and 
sandstone rock;  
 very limited coal reserves. Coal resources are considered in the Cumbria 
Minerals and Waste Local Plan 2015 –2030;  
 no peat extraction sites becau se within the National Park there are some of 
Britain’s most significant peat mires and their importance for conservation and for 
carbon absorption means that they are strictly protected;  
 no sand and gravel quarries currently operating;  
 no known oil or gas  reserves within the National Park ’s underlying geology; and  
 no onshore licences within the Lake District for oil and gas.  
[3.27.04] Quarrying is a recognised part of our cultural landscape and industrial 
background, and is an important local employer pr oviding opportunities for highly 
skilled manual jobs. However, there is no escaping that quarrying also has impacts, 
not least on the landscape but also on communities and the local roads.  
[3.27.05] The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS)  evaluation 
report into the English Lake District World Heritage nomination recommends that the 
Authority considers how it can provide assurances that quarrying activities within the 
English Lake District will be progressively downsized and extraction volu mes limited 
to what is needed for carrying out conservation of the assets supporting the 
attributes of the property.  96 
 [3.27.06] The National Planning Policy Framework requires mineral planning 
authorities to plan for a steady and adequate supply of aggrega tes. We have 
prepared a Local Aggregates Assessment for Cumbria jointly with Cumbria County 
Council. The land bank end date for crushed rock is mid -2059 and for sand and 
gravel the land bank end date is early 2026. Site allocations have been made in the 
Cumbria Minerals and Waste Local Plan that would provide sufficient reserve to 
maintain the land bank required for sand and gravel. A shortfall in supply of very high 
specification roadstone is identified at Ghyll Scar Quarry.  
[3.27.07] It is difficult to de termine the precise quantity and type of material required 
locally to support the level of development anticipated during the plan period. Within 
National Parks the scale of development should be  limited. This Plan establishes  a 
housing target of 80 new ho mes per annum, and development to support the 
employment sector (business, retail and tourism) is focussed on job creation rather 
than additional floorspace provision.  
[3.27.08] The potential for hydrocarbon fracking in the Lake District has not yet been 
assessed by British Geological Survey, but it is believed that it is limited to the areas 
around the periphery of the Lake District. Surface drilling is not allowed in National 
Parks through legislation, but operators may still apply to drill horizontally u nderneath 
a National Park, whilst the infrastructure is located outside it.  
Policy 27: Mineral extraction  
We want to ensure that there is an adequate supply of local building stone and slate 
to help maintain the distinctive buildings and settlement charact er of the Lake 
District, and of high value industrial minerals which are of local and national 
importance.  
We will achieve this by supporting:  
1. applications for building stone and slate extraction where it:  
 is for the extension of an existing site or the r eopening of an old site; and – 
meets a local need for building stone and slate; or  
 meets a need to conserve nationally significant buildings; and  
 makes careful use of mineral resources including the effective use of 
secondary aggregates.  
2. applications for high purity limestone extraction where it:  
 is for the extension of an existing site; and  
 meets an identified national need for high purity limestone; and  
 makes careful use of aggregates produced as a consequence of the industrial 
process.  
3. applications for  general aggregate extraction and processing only where the time 
period of planning permission is to be extended and not a physical extension to 
the area of extraction.  
In all cases proposals must demonstrate:  97 
  the sensitive environmental restoration and af ter care of mineral sites, 
including enhancement for biodiversity, geodiversity and landscape character 
and quality, and  
 support of the local economy and employment opportunities.  
We will not support new mineral sites for quarrying and mining.  
We will not support the extraction of hydrocarbons.  
 
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.27.09] This policy will be used in the assessment of all proposals for mineral 
extraction. For applications classed as major mineral extraction (see Glossary) we 
will also use the major development tests in the National Planning Policy Framework  
and Policy 26 ‘Major Development’ . 
[3.27.10] Any application for an entirely new site would be considered as a departure 
from this policy. In cases where the time period of planning permissi on is to be 
extended, the benefits of doing so will be weighed up against impacts on local 
amenity. New sites or the physical extension to the area of extraction of an existing 
site for the sole extraction of general aggregates will not be supported.  
[3.27 .11] Our primary aim regarding building stone and slate is to sustain a steady 
supply of building material to help maintain the local vernacular. However, we 
appreciate that for mineral operators to run a viable business it is essential to retain 
a broad c ustomer base that may extend beyond just the supply of local markets, 
such as supplying raw materials to conserve and repair nationally significant 
buildings. Whilst economic viability is a material consideration in the decision making 
process, this additi onal market should not be the sole reason for submitting an 
application; continuing the long tradition of fulfilling a local need for building stone 
and roofing slate will always be paramount in our decision.  
[3.27.12] We acknowledge that aggregates are pr oduced as a consequence of the 
industrial process associated with the extraction of high purity limestone, so we 
encourage the marketing of this by -product rather than it being stock piled.  
[3.27.13] We will not support applications for onshore extraction of conventional and 
unconventional hydrocarbons. The nature of this type of development can have 
visual impacts on a highly sensitive landscape, be intrusive on communities, natural 
capital assets and could potentially impact on the authenticity and integr ity of the 
attributes of the World Heritage Site.  
 
  98 
 Minerals Safeguarding Areas  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.28.01] We will safeguard minerals of economic importance from being sterilised by 
non-mineral development. Minerals Safeguarding Areas are a  way of protecting 
proven deposits of minerals which are, or may become, of economic value.  
Current situation  
[3.28.02] The Lake District has a complex and varied geology and is rich in mineral 
resources. The Lake District landscape was formed through 500 million years of 
geological processes, when the climatic conditions periodically underwent great 
changes. Slate, crystalline rocks, limestone, coal and red sandstone constituted the 
basic layers, with the formation of a central dome through volcanic intrus ion about 
280 million years ago.  
[3.28.03] Minerals can only be worked where they occur, there is significant pressure 
on land for a variety of development uses, so it is crucial our approach ensures 
future access to minerals is not restricted by non -mineral development.  
[3.27.04] Minera ls Safeguarding Areas identify where known locations of mineral 
resources exist. Using Mineral Resource Linework digital data provided by the British 
Geological Survey, we have defined the physical extent of the Minerals Safeguarding 
Areas (see Figure 15).  The following specific minerals resources are considered to 
be of local and national economic importance and have informed the Minerals 
Safeguarding Areas:  
 slates  
 igneous and metamorphic (granites)  
 limestone  
 sand and gravel  
[3.28.05] There is no presumpti on that applications to extract the mineral resources 
defined in Minerals Safeguarding Areas will be granted permission. Neither does a 
Minerals Safeguarding Area automatically preclude other forms of development. 
What it does, is draw attention to the pre sence of important mineral resources and 
make sure that they are adequately and effectively considered in land -use planning 
decisions.  
  99 
 Figure 15 : Extent of Minerals Safeguarding Areas  
 
100 
 Policy 28: Minerals Safeguarding Areas  
Planning permission will be granted for non -mineral development within Minerals 
Safeguarding Areas where:  
 the location of the proposal relates to a settlement recognised by Policy 02; or  
 the proposal can demonstrate that it will not affect the overall value of the mineral 
resource; o r 
 the mineral can be extracted satisfactorily prior to the development taking place; 
or 
 the development is of a temporary nature, can be completed and the site restored 
to a condition that does not inhibit extraction within the timescale that the mineral 
is likely to be needed; or  
 there is an overriding need for the development.  
 
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.28.06] We will apply the above policy in all land use and spatial planning decisions 
where an application for non -mineral development is proposed within defined 
Minerals Safeguarding Areas.  
[3.28.07] Policy 02: Spatial Strategy aims to enable development to support and 
maintain the vibrancy and sustainability of settlements and reinforce the distinct 
character which is recognised as one of the ‘Spec ial Qualities’ of the Lake District. 
For this reason, where a development proposal is in line with Policy 02 – and where 
the proposed development is within or well related to the form of the settlement – 
Minerals Safeguarding Areas do not apply. This will ensure there is no conflict with 
the aspirations of our spatial strategy.  
[3.28.08] In order to demonstrate that development will not affect the overall value of 
the mineral resource, we will consider amongst other things:  
 the scale of the proposed develo pment;  
 how the development relates to an existing use/development;  
 the proximity of the proposed development in relation to existing and/or old 
mineral sites;  
 any cumulative impact of the proposed and other development on the  economic 
value of the safeguarded mineral in its wider context; and  
 the statutory purposes of the National Park.  
  101 
 Waste management  
What are we trying to achieve?  
[3.29.01] We want to secure a more sustainable and efficient approach to resource 
use and management. Our aim is to  ensure that waste generated from new 
development is managed effectively and in accordance with the intentions of the 
waste hierarchy, to avoid its adverse effect on human health and the environment.  
Current Situation  
[3.29.02] Local Authorities are respon sible for managing Local Authority Collected 
Waste in their area. Cumbria County Council is responsible for the disposal of waste 
collected by the National Park Authority and the District Councils. The National Park 
Authority is the local waste planning au thority for the Lake District which means we 
determine applications for waste management proposals in the Lake District.  
[3.29.03] There are no operational waste disposal sites in the Lake District and little 
evidence of demand or need. The Cumbria Mineral s and Waste Local Plan did not 
identify a need for waste disposal sites within the Lake District, and through 
continued engagement with the County Council we were informed that Kendal Fell 
Quarry was no longer needed for Mechanical Biological Treatment.  
[3.29.04] The population of the Lake District is significantly increased each year by 
approximately 19 million tourists, generating waste which is collected through the 
Local Authority Collected Waste stream, much of which ends up in landfill or 
incineration . 
[3.29.05] There is one household waste recycling centre at Ambleside and several 
local recycling points in Rural Service Centres, Villages and Cluster Communities. 
There are several waste water treatment works in the Rural Service Centres and 
Villages. S eptic tanks are emptied via private waste contractors. Some agricultural 
waste is provided for through the Farm Plastic collection scheme which is operated 
locally and on -site hazardous or special wastes collection. Organic agricultural waste 
is traditiona lly disposed of through land spreading. Low level radioactive waste is 
managed at the Low Level Waste Repository in West Cumbria, outside the Lake 
District.  
[3.29.06] Additionally, there are approximately 1160 farm holdings in the Lake 
District producing o rganic agricultural waste. There is a need to embrace new 
technology to increase the scope for small -scale, on -farm anaerobic digestion plants 
as an alternative means of dealing with organic wastes.  
[3.29.07] We approve on average 900 planning applications  for new development 
each year, each of which creates construction and demolition waste to varying 
degrees, some of which ends up as landfill. Construction and demolition materials 
are generated when new building and civil engineering structures are built and when 
existing buildings and civil -engineering structures are renovated or demolished.  102 
 [3.29.08] The Lake District is a protected area based on its landscape and scenic 
beauty and new strategic landfill sites are considered inappropriate in relation to 
these issues. However, agricultural landfill for improvement purposes, business 
enhancement and biodiversity may be acceptable.  
[3.29.09] The Government is to embark on a new search to find a site suitable to 
develop a geological disposal facility to store  the UK’s high radioactive waste which 
may result in unacceptable impacts on the Lake District if neighbouring authorities 
consider hosting such a facility.  
Policy 29: Waste management  
We want to ensure the amount of waste produced as a consequence of new 
development is managed efficiently and effectively and is as high up the waste 
hierarchy as feasible.  
We will support new waste development where it:  
 is of a scale and type appropriate to its location;  
 manages and accommodates waste arising from the immedi ate area;  
 provides opportunities to diversify the local economy; and  
 does not have adverse impacts on residential amenity.  
We will support development on previously developed land which minimises 
construction and demolition waste.  
We will not support new, or extensions to, landfill sites for waste disposal.  
The exception being the use of inert waste for agricultural land enhancement, such 
as land improvement, business enhancement and biodiversity.  
We will not support a geological disposal facility for radioactive waste in or under the 
Lake District National Park.  
Policy implementation guidance  
[3.29.10] When determining planning applications for a waste management facility 
we will also consider the National Planning Policy for Waste, in particular the 
locational criteria set out in Appendix B of that document.  
[3.29.11] There are several types of waste development (see Glossary) that manage 
the varying types of waste. These facilities have different scales, visual impacts, 
noise levels, treatment process es and location requirements and not all are 
appropriate for the Lake District. Any new waste management facility must be of a 
scale and type that does not adversely affect its surroundings. For example, in -
vessel composters could be suitable for small sca le industrial or commercial 
operations. Open windrow composting is a common farm scale method which could 
be a farm diversification scheme, along with appropriately sized anaerobic digestion 
systems.  103 
 [3.29.12] We want to reduce construction and demolition waste from new 
development which involves the redevelopment of previously developed land, such 
as where a small property is to be knocked down and replaced by a larger property. 
We require the applicant to demonstrate how waste arising from the build proce ss 
will be minimised through reuse on and off site and recycling. See Policy 06: Design 
and development for further details.  
[3.29.13] There may be small areas of land which need improvement, such as 
agricultural land enhancement where using inert waste ma y be acceptable. Such 
proposals should accommodate waste from local sources.  
  104 
 Section 4  
Please refer to the standalone document “Section 4: Land Allocations” for details of 
site allocations and site requirements.  
  105 
 Section 5  
Monitoring, implementation and  review  
[5.1.01] Monitoring is essential to establish what is happening and what may happen 
in the future and it means we can compare trends against existing policies to assess 
performance and whether we need to make changes. We assess the progress and 
effectiveness of planning policies set out in the Local Plan by asking:  
 are policies achieving their intention, and is sustainable development being 
delivered?  
 have policies had or are they having the intended consequences?  
 are the strategic objectives behi nd the policies still relevant?  
 are the targets set out in the Local Plan being achieved?  
[5.1.02] The Local Plan will be monitored regularly over the plan period via the 
Annual Monitoring Report. We will monitor the Plan as a whole, and use the list of 
indicators in Table 2 to inform the Annual Monitoring Report. It provides us with the 
opportunity to critically evaluate the effectiveness of our planning policies and 
monitor if a policy is working. We can also use it to identify and consider any 
changes i n local circumstances which may influence the effectiveness of our 
policies.  
[5.1.03] The Annual Monitoring Report is used to monitoring trend data over time and 
can be used as a trigger to either initiate a review of the Local Plan or introduce 
additional  guidance on how to implement a policy, if required.  
[5.1.04] We have established two types of indicator which are either ‘core’ or 
‘contextual ’. Core indicators monitor the effectiveness of the policies within the Local 
Plan whereas the contextual indic ators provide additional information that has a 
wider contextual benefit such as linking to the State of the Park Report. Where we 
identify ‘bigger better’ or ‘smaller better’ as a target these reflect circumstances 
where the intention of the policy is to effect a specific change or outcome. Where ‘no 
target’ has been specified this reflects the indicators are largely contextual or 
respond to individual circumstance.  
[5.1.05] The aspirations of Local Plan, determined by the Vision and Strategic 
Objectives,  will be delivered with the support of landowners, members of the 
community and the Lake District National Partnership.

provides opportunities for informal recreation (such as dog walking) by the local 
community. Not all Amenity Local Green Space is publicly accessible.  
Approaches (visitor movement)  — general routes (directions) that visitors enter 
the Lake District.  
Areas at risk of flooding  — land within Flood Zone 2: Medium probability and Flood 
Zone 3: High probability. It can also include an area within Flood Zone 1 which the

are interdependent. Further information ca n be found in National Planning Policy 
Framework.  
Surface water drainage hierarchy  — generally aim to discharge surface water run -
off as high up the following hierarchy of drainage options as reasonably practicable:  
1: into the ground (infiltration)  
2: to a surface water body  
3: to a surface water sewer, highway drain or another drainage system;  
4: a combined sewer.  
Sustainable active travel options  — walking, cycling.  
Sustainable Drainage Systems  — to replicate the drainage patterns of natural
