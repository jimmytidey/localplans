Schedule of Revisions to the Wyre Local Plan (2011 -2031)  
The Wyre Local Plan (2011 -2031 ) was adopted on 28 February 2019. It contains 
Policy LPR1, which requires the early partial review of the Wyre Local Plan  (2011 -
2031) commencing before the end of 2019 and with submission of the review for 
examination by early 2022. Policy LPR1 sets out three clear criteria. Taken together 
these form the scope of the partial review of the Wyre Local Plan . The specific matters 
to be addre ssed include the following:  
1) An update of Objectively Assessed Housing Needs.  
2) A review of transport and highway issues taking into account:  
i) housing commitments and updated housing needs;  
ii) implemented and committed highway schemes;  
iii) the scope for sustainably l ocated sites where the use of sustainable 
transport modes can be maximised; and  
iv) the additional transport and highway infrastructure that will be needed to 
meet in full the updated Objectively Assessed Housing Needs.  
3) Allocation of sites to meet the full Obj ectively Assessed Housing Needs taking into 
account 2. above.  
Policy LPR1 is unequivocal, it is a focussed partial review and as such alterations to 
the plan period are not a part of that partial review.  
The council published a Regulation 18 letter (28 Fe bruary 2020) seeking responses 
on the scope of the Wyre Local Plan Partial Review  (2011-2031)  and subsequently 
confirmed, through its review of the responses received1, that it intends to gather 
evidence and prepare the necessary documents for a reviewed L ocal Plan.  
This document includes a schedule of proposed revisions  to the adopted Wyre Local 
Plan (2011 -2031) that are proposed as part of the Wyre Local Plan Partial Review  
(2011 -2031) .  The proposed revisions within this document are required to ensure that 
the council accords  with Policy LPR1  of the Wyre Local Plan  (2011 -2031) and the 
scope of the partial review in regards to an update of the Objectively Assessed 
Housing Need (Local Housing Requirement) and ensure conformity with the latest 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)  2021. The amendments have also 
sought to provide clarity in relation to the revisions to the Use Classes Order that came 
into effect on 1 September 2020 .    
A list of policies from the Wyre Local Plan (2011 -2031)  which will be superseded and 
deleted by the partial review are set out below :

Consequently, revisions to  supporting text and commentary, the monitoring chapter, 
and performance monitoring framework are also proposed.    
Following the upcoming Wyre Local Plan Partial Review (2011 -2031) Examination 
period , the council will prepare a  consolidated version of the new Local Plan that 
incorporates all accepted revisions by th is partial review.   Where  appropriate, other 
minor amendments including contents page, typos,  formatting,  paragraph and 
footnote renumber ing etc which are not includ ed within th e below  schedule , will also 
be updated  to provide clarity to the reader .  The consolidated Local Plan will 
superse ded the Wyre Local Plan (2011 -2031) and be known as the Wyre Lo cal Plan 
Partial Review (2011 -2031).  Upon adoption by Wyre Council, the Wyre Lo cal Plan 
Partial Review (2011 -2031) will form part of the development plan within Wyre 
Borough.   
The schedule presented below provides a list of proposed revisions to the Wyre Local 
Plan (2011 -2031) as part of this partial review, it a lso provides a short justification for 
each of the revisions.  Further justification for the proposed  revisions where they relate 
to policies can also be found within the supporting the Implementation of Policy LPR1 
Background Paper (2021).

¶ 1.2.1 – 1.2.3  Delete paragraph 1.2.1 – 1.2.3:  
1.2.1The Local Plan has been formulated by the Council over a number of 
years.  The key matters that have influenced the Local Plan are:  
1) Legal Requirements – The Local Plan must be legally compliant.  The 
local plan process is set out in regulations.    In exercising their plan 
making function, the Council must do so with the objective of 
contributing to the a chievement of sustainable development.  The 
Council also has a legal duty to engage constructively, actively and on 
an ongoing basis on strategic cross boundary issues during the 
preparation of the Local Plan.    
2) Public consultation – A public consultation  was carried out in June 2015 
on an Issues and Options paper which presented key issues and 
alternative spatial options and also alternative development sites 
across the Borough to be considered.   The Council received over 750 
representations   and althou gh there was not a consensus of how the 
Local Plan should respond to development needs, the response gave 
valuable information on people’s concerns.    Delete d as refers to Wyre Local Plan . 6

Public consultation on the ‘Publication’2 draft Wyre Local Plan took 
place over a six week period from t he 22 September 2017 to 3 
November 2017.   
3) Stakeholder Engagement – This involved working with various 
organisations including Highways England, Lancashire County Council 
(in particular as Highways Authority and Education Authority), Natural 
England, Envir onment Agency and United Utilities.   These and other 
organisations have been involved in preparing evidence to inform the 
draft Local Plan and Infrastructure Delivery Plan, (IDP).  The Council 
has also held meetings with representatives of Parish and Town  
Councils on a ‘confidential’ and ‘without prejudice’ basis.   It was 
important to keep Parish and Town Councils informed of the ‘direction 
of travel’ and seek their views where possible.   
4) Evidence Base – A number of studies have informed the preparation of 
the Local Plan.   The Local Plan was further informed and is supported 
by a number of appraisals such as a Sustainability Appraisal 
(incorporating a Strategic Environmental Assessment), a Habitat 
Regulations Assessment, a Viability Assessment and Equali ty Impact 
Assessment.    The Sustainability Appraisal has assessed the Local 
Plan Strategy against reasonable alternatives in terms of their 
contribution to achieving relevant environmental, economic and social

objectives. The evidence base including the v arious assessments can 
be viewed on the Council’s website at 
http://www.wyre.gov.uk/evidencebase .   
5) The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and National 
Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) –   Governm ent policy places an 
emphasis on the need to boost significantly the supply of housing.  This 
is reflected in the NPPF (2012) which stipulates that Local Plans should 
meet in full their objectively assessed needs.  The NPPF however also 
places emphasis on ‘sustainable development “which should be seen 
as a golden thread running through both plan -making and decision -
taking” (paragraph 14).  
6) Infrastructure Planning – In parallel with the preparation of the Local 
Plan, the Council has produced an Infrastructure  Delivery Plan (IDP) 
which assesses the impact of proposed development on infrastructure, 
and set out necessary infrastructure required to support proposed 
development. Infrastructure planning is an on -going process which 
enables infrastructure providers t o align their funding programmes 
accordingly with the development strategy and its implementation and 
as far as possible ensure that essential infrastructure associated with 
new development is brought forward at the right time.  
7) Examination – The Local Pla n with a schedule of minor modifications 
was submitted to the planning Inspectorate on the 23 of January 2018.  
Planning Inspector Mark Daykene conducted an examination into the 8 
 Chapter ;  
Policy ; and/or

Plan (2011 -

soundness of the Local Plan, holding hearing sessions on a number of 
issues in  May and June 2018.   During the examination the Council put 
forward a number of main modifications to the Local Plan to address 
soundness issues.  The Council has also prepared modifications to the 
Local Plan in response to the Inspector’s Post Hearing Ad vice.  A six 
week public consultation on main modifications was held September to 
October 2018.   
1.2.2 The Local Plan comprises both a written document (the ‘Written 
Statement’) and a Policy Map (the  adopted Policies Map).  
1.2.3 The Written Statement in cludes:  
1) A spatial portrait and Key Issues - a short description of what kind 
of place Wyre is and the key issues and challenges facing the 
Borough;  
2) Vision and objectives – a description of the kind of Borough Wyre 
aspires to be by 2031 and the objectives that have shaped the 
policies and proposals in the Local Plan towards the Vision;  
3) Local Plan Strategy – a description of the Local Plan Strategy, the 
key elements and how it was developed;

1.2.1 The Wyre Local Plan (2011 - 2031) was adopted on 28 February 
2019.  Policy LPR1 sets out three clear criteria which form the scope of the 
partial review of that Local Plan.  The specific matters to be addressed by 
the review includ e the following:  
1) An update of Objectively Assessed Housing Needs.  
2) A review of transport and highway issues taking into account : 
i) Housing commitments and updated housing needs;  
ii) Implemented and committed highway schemes;  Inserted to provide updated 
background information to reflect the

iii) The scope for sustainably located site s where the use of 
sustainable transport modes can be maximised; and  
iv) The additional transport and highway infrastructure that will 
be needed to meet in full the updated Objectively Assessed 
Housing Needs.  
3) Allocation of sites to meet the full Objectively As sessed Housing 
Needs taking into account 2. Above.  
1.2.2 Policy LPR1 is unequivocal, it is a focused partial review and as such 
alteration to the plan period is not a part of that partial review.  Accordingly, 
this partial review has considered the housin g need and requirement within 
the plan period of the Wyre Local Plan (2011 - 2031).  It has consequently 
incorporated alterations to relevant policies, to its supporting text and the 
monitoring chapter, including performance monitoring framework.   
1.2.3 R egulation 10A of the Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) 
(England) Regulation 2012 (as Amended by the 2017 amendment) 
requires that a local plan review is completed every 5 years, from the date 
of adoption of the plan.   
1.2.4 The Council will carry  out a separate full review of the Local Plan to 
meet the requirements of Regulation 10A.  This will result in a replacement 
Local Plan which will supersede this Wyre Local Plan Partial Review (2011 11 
 Chapter ;  
Policy ; and/or  
Paragraph in 
Wyre Local 
Plan (2011 -
2031)  Proposed Revision  Reason for change  
- 2031).  The full review will be prepared in accordance with the Local 
Development Scheme (LDS).  
1.2.5 In accordance with LPR1, an update of the objectively assessed 
housing need has been undertaken.  Following the adoption of the Wyre 
Local Plan (2011 - 2031), a revised National Planning Policy Framework 
(NPPF ) was published in July 2018 and subsequently updated in February 
2019 and July 2021. The NPPF is clear, that strategic policies should be 
informed by a local housing need assessment, conducted using the 
standard method as set out in national planning guid ance.  The standard 
method uses a formula to identify the minimum number of homes expected 
to be planned for, in a way which addresses projected household growth 
and historic under -supply.   
1.2.6 The Wyre Local Plan Partial Review (2011 - 2031) is support ed by 
the LPR1 background paper (2021) and contains the Council’s local 
housing need assessment, prepared to accord with revised national 
planning policy.  This concludes the housing need figure for Wyre is 296 
net dwellings per annum.  It also sets out th at the council does not consider 
it appropriate or justified to plan for a higher housing need figure than the 
standard method indicates.  The housing need figure is therefore capable 
of being the housing requirement figure for Wyre.  The housing requireme nt 
figure for the Wyre Local Plan Partial Review (2011 – 2031) is therefore 
296 net dwellings per annum.  The total housing requirement for the Plan 
Period is therefore a minimum of 7,232 net dwellings.  This consists of 460 12 
 Chapter ;  
Policy ; and/or  
Paragraph in 
Wyre Local 
Plan (2011 -
2031)  Proposed Revision  Reason for change  
net dwellings between 2011 and 2018/2019; and 296 net dwellings 
between 2019/2020 and 2031.  
1.2.7 Due to the focused scope of this partial review, please note that 
reference to housing Objectively Assessed Need (OAN or OAHN) 
throughout the document was correct at the time the Wyre Local  Plan 
(2011 – 2031) was adopted in 2019.  Due to the update to guidance, policy 
review and proposed revisions to Policy HP1, in most instances, reference 
to Objectively Assessed Need should be read as housing requirement.  
1.2.8 Criterion (2) of Policy LPR1  requires a review of transport and 
highways evidence and criterion (3) requires allocation of sites to meet the 
full objective assessed need, taking into account the reviewed transport 
and highway evidence.  
1.2.9 As part of the partial review and to acco rd with the Duty to Cooperate, 
Wyre Council has engaged with the three Highway Authorities: National 
Highways, Lancashire County Council and Blackpool Council.  The 
authorities have agreed with Wyre Councils conclusion, that there is no 
longer a need to re view  highway evidence as the net housing requirement 
of 296 dwelling per annum will be met in full and no revisions to the existing 
housing land supply set out in the adopted Local plan is proposed.  It is 
therefore the case that a review of the highway a nd transport evidence is 
no longer necessary to enable the Council to meet its housing requirement 
in full.   The Council will therefore not be presenting new highway and 
transport evidence as part of the partial review and any reference within 13

the partial  review reflects the position when the Wyre Local Plan (2011 –

1.2.10 A Duty to Cooperate Statement set’s out Wyre’s co -operation with 
various organisations in preparing the partial review.  The statement shows 
that Wyre has complied w ith the duty to cooperate.    
1.2.11 The Wyre Local Plan Partial Review (2011 – 2031) replaces in full 
the Wyre Local Plan (2011 – 2031).  As set out in figure 1.1, the partial 
review has amended six policies and deleted one policy contained in the 
Wyre Lo cal Plan (2011 – 2031). The amendments undertaken accord with 
the requirements of Policy LPR1 and the scope of the partial review in 
regards to an update of the Objectively Assessed Housing Need (Local 
Housing Requirement) and to ensure conformity with the  NPPF 2021. The 
amendments have also sought to provide clarity in relation to the revisions 
to the Use Classes Order that came into effect on 1 September 2020 (see 
section 1.5 below).

Plan period and ensuring the permanence of the Green Belt in the long 
term.   The land released from the Green Belt makes an important 
contribution to meeting the housing requirement  OAN  in Wyre.  As noted 
elsewhere, the Local Plan does not meet in full the housing OAN.  If the 
land in Poulton -le-Fylde were not released from the  Green Belt, the

7.2.4 The Local Plan housing requirement of 460 dwellings per annum will 
form the basis for calculating Wyre’s 5 year housing land position until the 
plan is reviewed. The maintenance of a 5 year supply is a requirement of 
government policy, and where this  cannot be demonstrated policies for the 
supply of housing are considered ‘out -of-date’ under current policy.    
7.2.5 In calculating the 5 -year land supply position at the time of adoption, 
the Council considers that the most appropriate way to deal with any 
shortfall since 1 April 2011 is for the shortfall to be met over the remainder 
of the Local Plan period i.e. the ‘Liverpool’ method.  This will ensure that 
there is a robust housing land supply and minimise the risk for the Local 
Plan housing strategy becoming out of date shortly after adoption.  The 
shortfall between 2011 and 2018 is substantial and equivalent t o over 2 
years requirement.  Meeting the shortfall over the Plan period results in a 
level of delivery that is realistic and yet  aspirational representing a 
significant boost to the delivery of housing in the Borough.  The  five year 
requirement  will be above what has ever been achieved in Wyre.    Deleted as refers to Wyre Local Plan.

land supply, the Local Plan does not propose to apply a restrictive phasing 
policy to the release of any allocated housing site.  Applying the substantial 
shortfall of 1,207 dwellings to the next five years requirement through the

10.4 Local Plan Review  
10.4.1 The Local Plan makes provision for 96% of the identified housing 
objectively assessed need, (OAN).   The main reason is the capacity of the 
local and strategic highway network to support development.  Although the 
Local Plan and supporting IDP ident ifies a number of highway measures 
to support development, these can only support up to 96% of the identified 
housing OAN.  
10.4.2 The Council is committed to undertaking an early partial review of 
the Local Plan as soon as possible after  adoption to addr ess the shortfall 
against the identified housing OAN, in accordance with Policy LPR1 below. 
This Local Plan includes sufficient land to meet identified needs in the first 
five years post adoption.  
10.4.3 The Council will consider, and if appropriate widen,  the scope of the 
partial review of the Local Plan, if there is evidence from the annual 
monitoring of Performance Monitoring Indicators (PMIs) that any targets 
are not being met.  
10.4.4 In determining the scope of the partial review the Council will also 
consider the level of inconsistency between Local Plan policies and the
