1.1 What is the District Plan?
1.1.1 TheDistrictPlansetsouttheCouncil’splanningframeworkforthedistrict.Itidentifies
how East Herts will grow and develop to become an even more desirable and
prosperousplacetolive,workandvisit.Itcoverstheperiod2011–2033andconsists
of a Written Statement (this document) and a Policies Map. Once adopted, the
policies in the District Plan will replace the policies in the Local Plan 2007.
1.1.2 TheDistrictPlan,togetherwiththeMineralsandWasteLocalPlansforHertfordshire
andanyadoptedNeighbourhoodPlans,formtheDevelopmentPlanforthedistrict.
The Development Plan is the basis upon which planning applications will be
determined,unlesstherearematerialplanningconsiderationsthatindicateotherwise.
The policies of the Plan should be read as a whole.
1.1.3 The District Plan is a long-term document which provides certainty to communities
and businesses as to where development will be provided and, likewise, where
precluding restrictions may apply. It also allows infrastructure providers to plan
effectively for the future.
1.1.4 TheDistrictPlanshouldbereadalongsidepoliciessetoutintheNationalPlanning
Policy Framework (NPPF).
1.2 Content of this Document
1.2.1 The District Plan Written Statement is divided into three parts:
Part 1: Development Strategy comprises Chapters 1-13 and includes the
visionandstrategicobjectives,developmentstrategyandsettlement/sitespecific
policies.
Part 2: Development Management Policies comprises Chapters 14-24 and
contains the policies which will be used by the Council in the determination of
planning applications.

1.3 Evidence Base
1.3.1 The preparation of the District Plan has been informed by an extensive evidence
base which is available to view on the Council’s website at:
www.eastherts.gov .uk/evidencebase
1.3.2 The technical studies cover a range of topics including housing need and delivery,
transport modelling, infrastructure requirements and economic development. A
Sustainability Appraisal and a Habitats Regulations Assessment have also been
undertaken.
1.4 Duty to Co-operate and Strategic Planning
1.4.1 The duty to co-operate was created in the Localism Act 2011 and places a legal
duty on local planning authorities, county councils and public bodies to engage
constructively, actively and on an ongoing basis to maximise the effectiveness of
local plan preparation in the context of strategic cross boundary matters.
1.4.2 The Council has undertaken extensive engagement with a range of organisations
including its neighbouring authorities and infrastructure providers throughout the
preparation of the District Plan.
1.4.3 East Herts forms part of the London Stansted Cambridge Corridor (LSCC) core
area which seeks to capitalise on the strategic locations of the corridor in order to
promote economic growth and prosperity. The Council is working with partner
authorities in the corridor to deliver the LSCC vision for the area.
1.4.4 The Council is also working, and will continue to work, with various other groups,
including the Hertfordshire Infrastructure and Planning Partnership (HIPP) and the
Co-operation for Sustainable Development Board.
1.5 Sustainable Development
1.5.1 The purpose of the planning system is to help achieve sustainable development.
There are three dimensions to sustainable development: economic, social and
environmental.ThesedimensionsgiverisetotheneedfortheDistrictPlantoperform
a number of roles:
aneconomicrole :contributingtobuildingastrong,responsiveandcompetitive
economy, by ensuring that sufficient land of the right type is available in the
right places and at the right time to support growth and innovation; and by
identifyingandcoordinatingdevelopmentrequirements,includingtheprovision
of infrastructure;Chapter 1 . Introduction
9East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
asocialrole :supportingstrong,vibrantandhealthycommunities,byproviding
the supply of housing required to meet the needs of present and future
generations; and by creating a high quality built environment, with accessible
local services that reflect the community’s needs and support its health, social
and cultural well-being; and
anenvironmental role : contributing to protecting and enhancing our natural,
built and historic environment; and, as part of this, helping to improve
biodiversity, use natural resources prudently, minimise waste and pollution,
and mitigate and adapt to climate change including moving to a low carbon
economy.
1.5.2 These roles are mutually dependent and as such should not be undertaken in
isolation.Economicgrowthcansecurehighersocialandenvironmentalstandards,
and well-designed buildings and places can improve the lives of people and
communities.Therefore,toachievesustainabledevelopment,economic,socialand
environmentalgainsshouldbesoughtjointlyandsimultaneouslythroughtheplanning
system.
1.5.3 In line with the requirements of the NPPF, the East Herts District Plan seeks to
create sustainable communities which embrace the principles of sustainable
development using a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of homes, jobs and
infrastructure.
1.5.4 The NPPF also highlights the Government’s desire to promote and support the
delivery of growth. Local authorities are urged to work proactively with applicants
and approve proposals wherever possible – where they accord with policies in the
District Plan. If the Plan is silent or out of date, local authorities are urged to grant
approval,havingregardtowhetheranyadverseeffectswouldsignificantlyoutweigh
the benefits, and other aspects of the NPPF. This approach has been termed a
‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’. The Government has issued
advice that a ‘model policy’ should be included within local plans, which reiterates
national guidance. This policy is set out below.Chapter 1 . Introduction
10
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
Policy INT1 Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development
I. The District Council will work proactively with applicants jointly to find solutions which
mean that proposals can be approved wherever possible, and to secure development
that improves the economic, social and environmental conditions in the area.
II. Planning applications that accord with the policies in this District Plan (and, where
relevant,policiesinNeighbourhoodPlans)willbeapprovedwithoutdelay,unlessmaterial
considerations indicate otherwise.
III. Where there are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are out of
date at the time of making the decision then the Council will grant permission unless
material considerations indicate otherwise taking into account whether:
a. Any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably
outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the National Planning
Policy Framework taken as a whole; or
b.SpecificpoliciesintheNationalPlanningPolicyFrameworkindicatethatdevelopment
should be restricted.Chapter 1 . Introduction

Chapter 2 Vision and Strategic Objectives
2.1 Introduction
2.1.1 ThischaptersetsouttheoverallstrategicvisionfordevelopmentinEastHertsover
the Plan period to 2033. The vision is supported by a set of strategic objectives
which, when considered together, provide the framework for the policies set out in
the District Plan.
2.2 East Herts District
2.2.1 The District of East Herts covers an area of 477 km2(184 square miles) and
comprisesaroundonethirdofthecountyofHertfordshire.Itispredominantlyarural
district,withattractivetownsandvillagessetinarollinglandscape.Topographically,
theDistrictisshapedlikeahandwiththeprincipalriversoftheLea,Mimram,Beane,
Rib, Ash, and Stort forming the fingers and higher ground lying in-between.
2.2.2 East Herts has a dispersed settlement pattern that includes the five market towns
ofBishop’sStortford,Buntingford,Hertford,SawbridgeworthandWare.Eachofthe
towns provides a range of services to the surrounding rural area. There are also
some hundred villages and hamlets of varying sizes.
2.2.3 Approximately the southern third of the District lies within the London Metropolitan
Green Belt.
2.2.4 East Herts lies in the core area of the London Stansted Cambridge Corridor. The
District is also heavily influenced by the presence of major settlements beyond its
boundary. The three New Towns of Stevenage, Harlow and Welwyn Garden City
are located immediately on the East Herts District boundary, and there is pressure
for expansion of these settlements. There are also substantial cross-boundary
influences from Cambridgeshire to the north and Essex to the east.
2.2.5 Historical development of the transport network has resulted in the District being
largely bypassed by strategic road and rail corridors; with the M11 and the West
Anglia Main Line between London and Cambridge to the east; and the A1(M) and
East Coast Main Line to the west. The M25 London Orbital Motorway lies further
to the south.
2.2.6 Within the District, the main road routes are the A10, which bisects the District
roughlyinhalfonanorth-southaxis;andtheA414inthesouthoftheDistrict,running
on an east-west axis. The A120 also runs east-west from the A10 at Puckeridge to
Bishop’s Stortford and beyond, and the A602 links the A10 from Ware with the
A1(M) in Stevenage. Stansted Airport, whilst outside the district, is immediately to
the north-east of Bishop’s Stortford and has strategic implications for the area.Chapter 2 . Vision and Strategic Objectives
14
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
2.2.7 The District contains many special landscape, natural and built heritage features
including:
3 international nature conservation designations
1 National Nature Reserve at Broxbourne Woods
1 Local Nature Reserve at Waterford Heath
15 Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust Reserves
16 Sites of Special Scientific Interest
543 non-statutory Wildlife Sites
Several chalk streams which support special wildlife habitats and species
45 Scheduled Monuments
Nearly 3,100 Listed Buildings
42 Conservation Areas
550 Areas of Archaeological Significance
16 Registered Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest
58 Locally Listed Historic Parks and Gardens
2.2.8 Residents in East Herts enjoy one of the highest qualities of life in rural Britain. In
particular residents in East Herts enjoy a good level of health and life expectancy.
Educational attainment is also high with students performing better in East Herts
than the wider region.
2.3 Key Issues and Challenges
2.3.1 East Herts is an attractive and prosperous area. However, there are still a number
of important issues and challenges facing the District. These are mainly related to
challengesofmanaginghighlevelsofgrowthandtheeffectsofpopulationincrease.
An overview of the key issues is set out below:
2.3.2 Environment – East Herts has a high quality environment, both within the towns
andvillagesandinthecountryside.Thechallengeistoensurethatthisisrecognised

responding to the particular issues in East Herts, including the rural economy.
2.3.4 Housing – East Herts is an attractive place to live, which is reflected in high house
prices.ThereisapressingneedformoreaffordablehousingintheDistrict.Achieving
housing development that responds to local needs, whilst recognising the
environmental and other constraints in East Herts, is a significant challenge. It is
also necessary to recognise the specific accommodation and housing needs of
different groups in the local community.
2.3.5 Infrastructure and Services – It is important that the infrastructure and services
needed to support new development are provided. This includes transport
infrastructure, education and health provision, utilities such as water, wastewater
and energy and improved broadband provision. The challenge is to ensure that
these services and facilities are delivered alongside growth.
2.3.6 Transport – The District is predominantly rural with a dispersed population which
creates challenges in providing a comprehensive public transport network. Many
local communities are reliant on the private car as their only transport option. This
impactsoncarbondioxideemissions,airquality,noise,publicsafetyandthequality
of the environment in towns and villages. The challenge is to ensure that
development is directed to sustainable locations, to reduce the need to travel and,
where journeys need to be made, the distance of those trips. Sustainable modes
of transport are also encouraged to both reduce reliance on the car and promote
healthier lifestyles.
2.3.7 Population – East Herts has an ageing population. Meeting the varying needs of
older people will be a challenge, whilst ensuring that the district remains attractive
and accessible to young people.
2.3.8 TownCentres –TheDistrict’smarkettownsformthecoreofEastHertsretailoffer
and their vitality and viability are critical to the success of the local economy. The
challenge is to support the main town centres in East Herts, which are all different,
all serve a particular purpose and all have particular needs.
2.3.9 RuralServices –Theretentionoflocalservicesisakeyissue,particularlyforrural

East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
2.3.10 Cross Boundary Issues – Understanding and taking account of the significance
and impact of cross boundary issues is key. These include those developments
planned outside East Herts but that will impact on the District. It also means
consideringhowthedevelopmentsplannedwithinEastHertsmightimpactonother
areas.
2.4 Vision
2.4.1 HavingidentifiedthemainplanningchallengesfortheDistrict,thissectionnowsets

2.6 London Stansted Cambridge Corridor (LSCC) Vision
2.6.1 TheCouncilsofBroxbourne,EastHerts,EppingForest,HarlowandUttlesfordform
the LSCC Core Area which lies at the heart of the London Stansted Cambridge
Corridor(LSCC).Thiscorridorhas,overthepastdecadeormore,beentheengine
of UK growth with its world class industries and businesses.
2.6.2 Over the past five years the Corridor’s dynamic, knowledge-based economy has
grown at a rate almost double that of the UK average and as a result rates of
populationgrowthhaveincreased.Transportlinksareexcellent;withtwomajorrail
routes - the East Coast and West Anglia main lines - serving the Corridor. The
A1(M), A10 and M11 motorways link its towns and cities with the capital, while
London Stansted Airport offers international connections.
2.6.3 With a significant number of jobs in knowledge-based industries, the Corridor is a
leading knowledge economy and a showcase for tech industries and firms. There
is a high rate of innovation.
2.6.4 The Corridor accounts for 24,700 jobs in the life sciences sector contributing 11%
of all national employment. This success is built on research institutes and notable
firms and organisations, including Amgen and AstraZeneca in Cambridge,
GlaxoSmithKline in Stevenage and Ware, and Public Health England in Harlow.
2.6.5 The continued success of the Corridor as a great place to live, work, do business
and visit provides the opportunity for the Core Area to deliver greater and lasting
prosperity for its residents and businesses. As such the Council is working with its
partner authorities in the Core Area to deliver the following LSCC strategic vision

Chapter 3 The Development Strategy
3.1 Introduction
3.1.1 ThischaptersetsouttheCouncil’sstrategyfordeliveringgrowthinEastHertsover
the Plan period up to 2033. It looks at the amount of new development that will be
delivered, and where it should be located across the District. It also identifies the
need for new site allocations to deliver this strategy, and what new infrastructure
and services may be required.
3.1.2 ThestrategyseekstodeliverthevisionandobjectivesinChapter2andensurethat
growth in East Herts is ‘sustainable’. Sustainable development is defined as
‘developmentwhichmeetstheneedsofthepresentwithoutcompromisingtheability
offuturegenerationstomeettheirownneeds’.Inessenceitmeansprovidinggrowth
which meets the needs of existing and future residents, while mitigating adverse
economic, environmental and social impacts. The amount and location of growth
is important. It is also critical to ensure that growth is accompanied by the required
infrastructure and services in order to support the quality of people’s lives.
3.1.3 This chapter also sets out how local people can facilitate the delivery of growth
themselves,andinfluencetheirlocalarea–throughNeighbourhoodPlanning.The
Government’slocalismagendahasraisedtheprofileandimportanceofcommunity
involvement in planning. The Council is supportive of this approach.
3.2 Level of Growth
3.2.1 Thissectionlooks attheamountofhousing,employmentand retailgrowththatthe
Council will seek to facilitate over the Plan period. Other types of development will
also be needed in the District over the Plan period including, for example, green
infrastructure and community facilities. These requirements are explored further in
the relevant topic chapters (see Part 2 of the Plan) and settlement chapters.
Housing Growth
3.2.2 Following the abolition of the East of England Regional Spatial Strategy in 2013,
the Council is responsible for identifying a housing ‘target’ in the District Plan. The
right level of housing can help to support economic growth, meet local housing
needs, and facilitate the delivery of infrastructure. Having a housing target also
allows a local authority to work with service providers and other organisations to
ensurethatsuitableinfrastructureisprovidedtomeettheneedsofnewdevelopment.
3.2.3 The Council has worked closely with its housing market area partners (Harlow,
Epping Forest and Uttlesford Councils) in order to prepare technical evidence that
identifiesan‘objectiveassessmentofhousingneed’takingintoaccountpopulation
projections, affordable housing needs and jobs growth.Chapter 3 . The Development Strategy
24
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
3.2.4 The evidence concludes that the combined level of housing need across the four
local authority areas is 51,878 homes for the period 2011 - 2033. This figure has
beendisaggregatedamongstthefourauthorities.AMemorandumofUnderstanding
(MoU)hasbeenpreparedwhichcommitsallfourCouncilstomeetingtheirindividual
housingneedswithintheirownadministrativeboundaries. ForEastHerts,thelevel
of need is 839 new homes per year, or 18,458 new homes by 2033 . The Council
is committed to meeting its Full Objectively Assessed Housing Need, and as such
its housing requirement over the Plan period 2011 - 2033 is for 18,458 homes.
3.2.5 In order to meet this challenging housing target, the District Plan has allocated a
number of sites across East Herts. These sites are identified in Section 3.3 later in
the chapter.
3.2.6 It is important to note that the housing need figure for the District does not include
the projected increase in the number of people within residential institutions. A
technical document known as the Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)
identifies the projected growth in population aged 75 or over living in communal
establishments in the District, as 529 persons, between 2011-2033. Therefore, in
addition to the overall housing target, this Plan supports a gross increase of
approximately 530 bed-spaces of C2 provision, primarily to help meet the
accommodation needs of older people who need to live in an environment which
provides residential or nursing care.
Evidence underpinning the objective assessment of housing need is available to view
on the Council’s website at: www.eastherts.gov .uk/evidencebase .
Economic Growth
3.2.7 In addition to housing need, the Council has also worked with its neighbouring
authoritiesinordertounderstandhowmanynewjobsarelikelytobecreatedwithin
the plan period. This work, which was undertaken to inform the SHMA, indicates
that 10,800 new jobs will be created in East Herts between 2011 and 2033,
equivalent to 491 jobs each year.
Evidence underpinning job requirements is available to view on the Council’s website

3.2.8 InordertohelpsupportjobsgrowthintheDistrict,thisPlanseekstoensuresufficient
provision of land and premises for office, industrial and warehousing uses (B1, B2,
B8 uses) in sustainable locations which meet the needs of local businesses. As
such, 19-20 hectares of new employment land will be provided in the following
locations:
3 hectares to the north of Buntingford Business Park (BUNT3);
4 hectares within the development at Bishop's Stortford North (BISH3);
4-5 hectares within the development at Bishop’s Stortford South (BISH5);
3 hectares within the development at North and East of Ware (WARE2): and
5 hectares within the development at the Gilston Area (GA1).
3.2.9 In addition, around 3,000 square metres of B1 employment floorspace, or other
employmentgeneratingusesthatwouldbecompatiblewiththeusesonneighbouring
land, will be provided at the Mead Lane Area, Hertford, site (HERT2).
3.2.10 In order to recognise the valuable role existing businesses have, the following
existing industrial and commercial locations have also been designated as
Employment Areas:
6 hectares to the east of Welwyn Garden City;
0.23 hectares at Millside Industrial Estate, Bishop’s Stortford;
0.36 hectares at Southmill Trading Estate, Bishop’s Stortford;
7.44 hectares at Pegs Lane/Hale Road, Hertford;
0.43 hectares at Leeside Works, Stanstead Abbotts; and
0.59 hectares at Riverside Works, Amwell End, St Margarets.
3.2.11 In addition, all Employment Areas that were previously identified through the East
HertsLocalPlan2007haveretainedtheirdesignationthroughtheDistrictPlan.The
Council encourages the provision of new employment land created through
mixed-use developments, which should contain small-scale business units. These
will make valuable contributions to balancing new residential developments with
local employment opportunities. These employment areas may be designated
through future revisions to the District Plan.Chapter 3 . The Development Strategy

3.2.12 Moredetailontheapproachtoemploymentiscontainedinthesettlementchapters
and in Chapter 15 (Economic Development). Proposals that affect designated and
non-designated Employment Areas will be considered in accordance with Policies
ED1 (Employment) and ED2 (Rural Economy).
Retail Growth
3.2.13 As the population grows, additional retail development will be required to provide
shopping opportunities at the local level. The Council’s ‘Retail and Town Centres
StudyUpdate’(2013)assessesqualitativeissuesandquantitativerequirementsfor
additional retail floorspace to meet future needs. The Study concludes that there
will be a need over the Plan period for:
1. Convenience (food) retail – an additional 7,100m2 (net) of new floorspace
2. Comparison (non-food) retail – an additional 5,700m2 (net) of new floorspace
3.2.14 Thesefloorspacerequirementstakeintoaccountcurrentplanningpermissions,but
not the potential reoccupation of vacant floorspace.
The Retail and Town Centres Study Update (2013) is available to view on the Council’s

3.2.15 The Plan seeks to ensure that new retail development occurs in a manner that

as to stifle innovation and investment. There is a need for a balanced approach to
enabling retail centres to respond to changing retail behaviour, whilst preserving
andenhancingtheessenceandhistoriccharacterwhichiskeytotheattractiveness
of the District’s historic market towns.
3.2.16 More detail on the approach to retail requirements is contained in the settlement
chapters and in Chapter 16 (Retail and Town Centres).
3.2.17 New retail provision will be encouraged within major urban extensions in order to
support the new and existing communities. These will be neighbourhood centres
or local parades(1)as appropriate and will complement the existing town centres.Chapter 3 . The Development Strategy
27East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
Policy DPS1 Housing, Employment and Retail Growth
In the period 2011 to 2033 the Council will:
(a) Provide for a minimum of 18,458 new homes in the District up to 2033.
(b) Maximise opportunities for jobs growth, with the aim of achieving a minimum
of 10,800 new jobs in the District up to 2033. This will include making provision for
19-20 hectares of new employment land for B1/B2/B8 uses.
(c) Encourage an additional 7,100m2of convenience and 5,700m2of comparison

Guiding Principles and Strategy
3.3.2 The District Plan is based on a number of guiding principles. The principles are
basedonnationalpolicyandlegalrequirementsappliedtothelocalcircumstances
of the East Herts area.
Guiding Principles
1. To allocate sufficient sites in order to meet the full housing needs of East Herts;
2. To prioritise the development of brownfield land and other appropriate sites within
the urban areas of the settlements, but to avoid over-development of such sites;
3. To promote self-containment by directing development to areas where there is
reasonable proximity to services and facilities, and which reflect existing travel to
workareas,schoolcatchments,andretailspendpatternsandfunctionalgeographies;
4. Wherever possible to utilise readily available features to provide clear and
unambiguous Green Belt boundaries;
5. Toco-operatewithadjoiningauthoritiesoncross-boundarystrategicmatterswhere
it is reasonable to do so;
1 As defined within Section 16.8 of Chapter 16: Retail and Town Centres.Chapter 3 . The Development Strategy
28
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
6. To focus development in locations where the impacts on the historic and natural
environment are minimised as far as possible;
7. To acknowledge that the capacity for the market towns and villages to grow is
constrained by the existing capacity and future potential of these settlements, and
therefore the provision of large-scale strategic development will be required, both
within this Plan period and beyond;
8. To protect and enhance the rural area and the Green Belt outside the allocated
developmentareastomaintainthecountrysideandtheruralcharacteroftheDistrict;
9. To encourage appropriate development in and around the identified villages, with
an opportunity for neighbourhood planning to influence the type and location of
development sites.
3.3.3 The strategy must have regard to a number of housing requirements set out in the
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).
3.3.4 Firstly, the NPPF requires that every effort should be made to meet the housing,
businessandotherdevelopmentneedsofanarea.AssetoutaboveinSection3.2,
the housing need in the District is for 839 new homes each year. East Herts’
projected need is back-dated to 2011 when the previous Local Plan figures ended,
meaning that the total need is for 18,458 homes up to 2033.
3.3.5 Secondly, the NPPF requires a supply of specific deliverable sites in order to meet
housing needs in the first five years of the plan period. For East Herts, the first five
year period is 2017 to 2022.
3.3.6 Intheperiod2011-2017(the‘pre-plan’period)itisanticipatedthatonly3,244homes
willbebuilt,leavingashortfallof1,790homeswhenmeasuredagainsttheprojected
need of 5,034 over 6 years. The Plan seeks to make up this shortfall over the ten
year period 2017 – 2027 as set out in Table 3.1 below.
3.3.7 Thirdly, the NPPF also requires the provision of an additional buffer in the first five
year period (moved forward from later in the plan period) to ensure choice and
competition in the market for land. A 20% buffer should be applied where there is
a persistent record of under-delivery. Given the significant shortfall in housing
delivery since 2011, a 20% buffer should be applied. Taking into account identified
need, the shortfall and the 20% buffer, the total housing requirement for the first
five year period (2017-2022) is 6,108 new homes as set out in Table 3.2 below.Chapter 3 . The Development Strategy

3.3.8 Policy DSP2 (The Development Strategy 2011-2033) below sets out the Council's
strategy for delivering sustainable development. More detailed information about
individual sites can be found in the settlement chapters. Policy DPS2 also sets out
thekeyassumptionswhicharereliedontocalculatethe5-yearhousinglandsupply.
Policy DPS2 The Development Strategy 2011-2033
I. The strategy of the District Plan is to deliver sustainable development in accordance
with the following hierarchy:
Sustainable brownfield sites;
Sites within the urban areas of Bishop’s Stortford, Buntingford, Hertford,
Sawbridgeworth and Ware;
Urban extensions to Bishop’s Stortford, Hertford, Sawbridgeworth and Ware, and
to the east of Stevenage, east of Welwyn Garden City and in the Gilston Area; and
Limited development in the villages.
II. The 5-year housing land supply will comprise the following elements:
The projected housing need of 839 dwellings per annum;
Any shortfall in delivery since the start of the Plan period (to be met over the ten
year period 2017-2027);
A 20% buffer for choice and flexibility brought forward from later in the Plan period.
3.3.9 The main policy elements of the development strategy are shown on the Key
Diagram.Insetmapsshowingfurtherdetailonparticularlocationsareshowninthe
relevant section of the Plan. The Key Diagram including the main map and inset
maps is included at Appendix A.
Housing Supply
3.3.10 There are a number of potential sources of housing supply as follows:
1. Completions and commitments are shown in the period 2011-2017, based on
the most recently available monitoring data.
2. Withintheurbanareasofthetowns,alimitednumberofsiteswithcapacityfor
10 or more homes have been identified through the Strategic Land Availability
Assessment (SLAA).Chapter 3 . The Development Strategy
31East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
3.Itisalsoanticipatedthattherewillbeanumberofpermissionsgrantedonsmall
sites of less than 10 homes that have not currently been identified. These are
known as windfalls. A windfall allowance of 75 dwellings per annum has been
made on the basis of an analysis of past windfalls.
4. The majority of new homes will be provided on sites that have been allocated
within this Plan. These are shown on the Policies Map and the site locations
are shown in red alongside each of the site specific policies in the settlement
chapters.
5. Finally, in addition to providing new homes within the Plan period, the Gilston
Area will provide a further 6,950 new homes after 2033 while North and East
of Ware will also provide a further 500 homes subject to the identification of
suitable highways mitigation measures.
3.3.11 PolicyDPS3(HousingSupply2011-2033)reflectsthesedifferentsourcesofhousing
supply. It also sets out the contribution from each source for the important first five
year period after adoption (2017-2022).
3.3.12 The identified housing supply to 2033 exceeds the requirement by around 450
homes. Contingency planning is necessary to allow for eventualities beyond the
Council’s control,including the economic cycle and factorsrelating to specific sites

The potential to achieve this will be considered through joint work in relation to the
HarlowandGilstonGardenTown.Afullbreakdownofthehousingsupplyisincluded
at Appendix B.
3.3.13 The Council’s positive approach to planning may require it to use its compulsory
purchase powers under section 226 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
That power gives the Council a positive tool to help to assemble land where this is
necessary to implement proposals in the District Plan or where strong planning
justifications for the use of the power exist. For the circumstances in which those
powers may be exercised, see the Department for Communities and Local
Government’s“CompulsorypurchaseprocessandtheCrichelDownRules:guidance”
at:www.gov.uk
Green Belt
3.3.14 Green Belt land is a valued resource for many residents in East Herts. However,
the challenging level of housing need in the District cannot be met in a sustainable
way without undertaking a carefully planned review of the Green Belt in certainChapter 3 . The Development Strategy

waterandenergysupply,wastewaterdisposal,roads,educationandhealthcareas
well as open space, and green infrastructure. Therefore it is important to ensure
that appropriate levels of infrastructure are provided to support growth and meet
the objectives of the District Plan.
3.3.16 TheCouncilplaysanimportantroleincoordinatingarangeofagenciesandbodies
which deliver infrastructure in East Herts, in order to ensure delivery alongside
housing growth. Infrastructure providers include Hertfordshire County Council
(including transport and education), NHS England and the Clinical Care
Commissioning Group (healthcare), utility companies, as well as the Council itself.
3.3.17 The planning system can be used in a number of other ways, including securing
theprovisionofinfrastructureorcontributionstowardsinfrastructurefromdevelopers.
The District Plan also assists by protecting existing facilities against loss.Chapter 3 . The Development Strategy

East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
3.3.18 Policy DPS4 (Infrastructure Requirements) identifies the key infrastructure
requirements that are likely to be needed over the plan period to support the levels
of growth envisaged in Policy DPS2 (The Development Strategy 2011-2033). This
list has been informed by discussions with key infrastructure providers. The list is
notexhaustiveanddoesnotincludesite-specificinfrastructurewhichmayberequired

3.3.19 A full list of infrastructure schemes can be found in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan
(IDP), which also provides information on costs, funding and phasing. The IDP will
be reviewed on a regular basis in order to identify risks and monitor the
implementation of infrastructure schemes and identify where interventions might
be required.
The Infrastructure Delivery Plan can be viewed on the Council’s website

Green Belt and Rural Area Beyond the Green
Belt
Chapter 4 Green Belt and Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt
4.1 Green Belt
4.1.1 The fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping
land permanently open; the essential characteristics of Green Belts are their
openness and their permanence.
4.1.2 The National Planning Policy Framework sets out the five main purposes of the
Green Belt:
to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas;
to prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another;
to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment;
to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and
to assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and
other urban land.
4.2 Local Context
4.2.1 HertfordshireCountyCouncilfirstdesignatedthesouthoftheCountyasGreenBelt
as part of the Hertfordshire County Development Plan, published in 1951 and
approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in December 1958,
under the Town and Country Planning Act 1947.
4.2.2 The extent of the Green Belt in East Herts was originally limited to a small area
southofHertfordandWare.Howeverthe1979CountyStructurePlanextendedthe
area of Green Belt northwards along the A1 to Stevenage and beyond, and along
the M11 to the southern limits of Bishop's Stortford.
4.2.3 The 1986 County Structure Plan Review included the extension of the Green Belt
to surround Bishop's Stortford, with the inner Green Belt boundaries being defined
through the East Herts Local Plan Review, adopted in 1993.
4.2.4 ThebroadextentoftheGreenBeltwascarriedforwardinthe2007EastHertsLocal
Plan and as such contains the settlements of Bishop’s Stortford, Hertford,
Sawbridgeworth and Ware, together with several villages.
4.3 Exceptional Circumstances
4.3.1 The NPPF states that Green Belt boundaries can only be amended in exceptional
circumstances, through the preparation or review of a Local Plan. There is no
definition in the NPPF of what constitutes exceptional circumstances, as this will
vary for each locality.Chapter 4 . Green Belt and Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt
40
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
4.3.2 In East Herts there is a combination of factors that exist locally that together
constitutetheexceptionalcircumstancesthatrequiretheCounciltoamenditsGreen
Belt boundaries. This includes the high level of housing need, including affordable
homes,exacerbatedbyasignificantbacklogofunmetneed,andthelackofsuitable

authorities should ensure that substantial weight is given to any harm to the Green

Chapter 5 Bishop's Stortford
5.1 Introduction
5.1.1 Bishop’s Stortford is the largest town in the District, with an important sub-regional
rolerelatedtoitsretail,leisureandemploymentoffer,whichisunderpinnedbygood
transport links including the M11 and the railway. It is designated as a Principal
Town Centre which reflects the wide range of uses and services present, and its
role as a destination for visitors from beyond the town. The town retains a very
attractive historic core and has a thriving town centre with a regular market. It has
areputationforgoodschoolsandalsobenefitsfromnumerousareasofgreenspace
in the Stort corridor and ‘Green Wedges’ which penetrate the town. The town is
unusual in East Herts in having several remaining brownfield redevelopment
opportunities,althoughthescaleofhousingneedinthelocalareaalsonecessitates
the provision of well-designed urban extensions on land adjoining the town.
5.1.2 The main components of the development strategy for Bishop’s Stortford are as
follows:
5.1.3 Housing : additional homes will be provided which will consist of a mix of dwelling
types and sizes to ensure that the need of residents to access a balanced housing
market across all life stages is catered for. The provision of affordable housing will
allowemerginghouseholdstoremainlivinginBishop’sStortfordinaccommodation
suited to their needs, while essential opportunities are provided for those seeking
retirement accommodation or who are in need of specialist care.
5.1.4 Design: collaborativelypreparedMasterplansfordevelopmentinBishop’sStortford

provide a strong framework for the development, which will ensure the highest
quality design and layout of each area and provide a comprehensive approach to
the development as a whole, whilst reflecting different character areas across the
sites. The Masterplans will accord with the provisions of Policy DES1
(Masterplanning).
5.1.5 Education : the educational needs of the town will be achieved at primary level via
the expansion of existing facilities at Thorley Hill Primary School, together with the
provision of up to three new primary schools at Bishop’s Stortford North (BISH3)
andonenewprimaryschoolinBishop’sStortfordSouth(BISH5).Onenewsecondary
school will be provided at Bishop’s Stortford North (BISH3) and one at Bishop’s
Stortford South (BISH5).
5.1.6 Transport : measures introduced within new development will encourage the use
of sustainable travel, particularly through the enhancement of walking and cycling
linksandthroughtheprovisionofnewbusrouteslinkingnewsitestothetowncentre

sets out initiatives to tackle traffic congestion in and around the town.
5.1.7 Economic Development : the proximity of Bishop’s Stortford to the M11 and
Stansted Airport makes it an attractive place for businesses and new employment
opportunities in the town will be provided by a new business park at Bishop’s
Stortford South. As the District’s Principal Town Centre, there is a stronger retail
offer than other centres in the District, and has good prospects for expansion.
Development at Old River Lane (BISH8) will increase the retail and leisure offer of
the town and strengthen links across the river to the railway station to encompass
theGoodsYard(BISH7)and,inthelong-term,possiblyalsotheMillSite(BISH10).

of a new Country Park at Hoggate’s Wood and Ash Grove will extend the pattern
of Green Wedges which frame the urban area. The A120 and A1184 will continue
to provide a boundary to development and retain the town’s compact character.
Long views to historic features, such as church spires, will be preserved through
the layout of new streets. Development of the Goods Yard (and possibly in the
long-term, the Mill Site) and other development sites which may come forward, will
enhance the River Stort corridor, creating public spaces along the river. The urban
extension at Bishop’s Stortford South will provide an attractive new gateway to the
town.
5.2 Neighbourhood Plans
5.2.1 There are two neighbourhood plans covering this area. The Bishop’s Stortford

Chapter 6 Buntingford
6.1 Introduction
6.1.1 Buntingfordisasmalltownlocatedatthecentreofalargeruralareainthenorthern
half of the District. The town has developed in a valley setting astride the River Rib
and the Roman Road Ermine Street and is surrounded by open countryside.
6.1.2 Being surrounded by an extensive rural hinterland enables Buntingford to function
asanimportantruralservicecentrefortheoutlyingvillagesinthenorthoftheDistrict.
Despite its small size, the town has an extensive range of services and facilities
that serve the day-to-day needs of residents, and a vibrant local community
demonstrated by the numerous clubs and societies that are active in the town.
6.1.3 The historic core of the town, centred on the High Street, is an attractive location
whichsupportslocalindependenttradersandaweeklymarket.Thetownisserved
by two small supermarkets but residents have to travel to larger nearby towns for
comparison shopping trips. Buntingford is therefore regarded as a Minor Town
Centre.
6.1.4 Themedieval towncentrelies withina ConservationArea,withtheevolutionofthe
town’s urban form being influenced by its historical role as an important coaching
stop on the route from London to York. The town has numerous buildings which
are listed for their historical significance providing a visual record of the history of
the town.
6.1.5 Buntingford is the only town in East Herts that is not served by a railway, and bus
service connections to other settlements are limited, resulting in a reliance on the
private car as a means of transport to access larger nearby settlements for
employment and leisure purposes. However, this relative remoteness has enabled
the town to retain its Market Town character.
6.1.6 As there has been some loss of employment in the town in recent years, it is
important that the town should seek to maintain and improve on its current
employment provision, in order to provide local jobs for both existing and new
residents of the town. Enhancements to the town’s broadband infrastructure will
support existing businesses in the town and help attract new businesses to locate
in Buntingford.
6.1.7 As Buntingford is the only town in the District not constrained by Green Belt, it has
been subject to a number of speculative planning applications in advance of the
adoption of the District Plan. The development of approximately 1,100 dwellings
has been approved across a number of sites in the town since 2011 and therefore,
the development strategy for Buntingford is focused on seeking to ensure that the
impacts of development can be mitigated and managed within the overall
infrastructure of the town.
6.1.8 The main components of the development strategy for Buntingford are as follows:Chapter 6 . Buntingford
78
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
6.1.9 Housing : additional homes will be provided which will consist of a mix of dwelling
types and sizes, including bungalows and specialist retirement accommodation, to
ensure that Buntingford's population is able to access a balanced housing market
catering for all life stages. The provision of affordable housing as part of new
residential and mixed use development schemes will allow emerging households
to be able to remain living in Buntingford in accommodation suited to their needs.
6.1.10 Education : the town and surrounding villages are served by a three tier education
system. Education provision at the upper level will be enhanced via the expansion
ofFremanCollegeandtheprovisionofnewplayingfields,whichhavebeensecured
as part of the new development being constructed to the north of the town. At the
middletier,EdwinstreeMiddleSchoolwillbeexpandedtoprovideadditionalschool
places to meet the educational needs of the town and the surrounding villages at
this level.
6.1.11 The educational needs of the town at the lowest tier, First Schools, will be met
through the expansion of Millfield First and Nursery School to 2 forms of entry and
through the provision of a new 2 form of entry First School in the town. Land to the
eastofLondonRoadhasbeenallocatedforthispurpose.Inaddition,expansionof
Layston C of E School may also be required.
6.1.12 Transport : as part of development proposals for the town, bus services will be
enhanced to support travel around the town and to provide links to neighbouring
towns.FinancialcontributionstowardstheimplementationofaCommunityTransport
project have been secured from some of the approved development schemes in
the town which will, once established, provide a valuable service to the residents
of the town and neighbouring villages. New developments will encourage the use
of sustainable travel modes through the enhancement of walking and cycling links
around the town. The impact of development on the local road network will be
mitigatedthroughupgradestoexistingjunctions,includingwideningoftheexitlinks
at the A10/London Road roundabout.
6.1.13 Other Infrastructure : improvements to wastewater networks may be required to
support existing and new developments whilst the broadband infrastructure of the
town is due to be upgraded in 2017/18.
6.1.14 Employment and Retail : the large rural hinterland surrounding the town makes
Buntingford an ideal base for small businesses that have links to the town itself
rather than those that rely on a proximity to major road networks. Existing
employment sites in Buntingfordwill be retained and, where appropriate, extended
and modernised. 2 hectares of employment land has been retained through the
redevelopment of the former Sainsbury’s Depot site, and an additional 3 hectares
ofemploymentlandhasbeenallocatedasanextensiontotheBuntingfordBusiness
Park.
6.1.15 The town centre of Buntingford will retain its role as a minor town centre with a
secondaryshoppingfrontagewhichwillcontinuetofunctionasanimportantservice
centre for its large rural hinterland, whilst retaining its market town characteristics.Chapter 6 . Buntingford
79East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
Economic and housing development will increase available expenditure to help
support a good range of services including jobs, shopping, leisure and education,
to meet the needs of residents of the town and surrounding villages.
6.1.16 Leisure and Community Facilities : Buntingford’s leisure facilities will be
supplemented by the provision of new playing pitches and a large area of public
open space as part of development to the north of the town. Public access to the
countryside that surrounds the town will be maintained and enhanced. New burial
space will be provided in the town.
6.1.17 Character : Buntingford will preserve its market town character and the quality of
the town’s historic core will be respected in new development proposals.
Development to the north and south of the town will enhance primary routes into
the town, providing a visual transition between rural and urban, and development
to the east will be appropriately landscaped, respecting the valley landscape of the
town. To the south-west, the open character of the countryside between Aspenden
and Buntingford will be preserved, thereby avoiding coalescence between the two
communities.
6.2 Neighbourhood Plan
6.2.1 The Buntingford Community Area Neighbourhood Plan was ‘made’ in May 2017.
The Plan covers the market town of Buntingford and the surrounding villages of
Aspenden,BucklandandChipping,Cottered,HormeadandWyddial.ThePlansets
out policies on business and employment, environment and sustainability, housing
development, infrastructure, leisure and recreation, and transport.
6.2.2 The Plan forms part of the development plan and as such any proposals within the
Neighbourhood Plan area must also accord with the policies set out in the
Neighbourhood Plan.

First School Site Allocation
6.3.4 Hertfordshire County Council, as Local Education Authority, is responsible for the
planning of school places in the District, and has identified that a new 2 form of
entry (2FE) First School is required in Buntingford.
6.3.5 In order to meet this need, land to the east of London Road has been allocated for
the provision of a 2FE First School (see Figure 6.2). The site is strategically placed
to meet future identified need and will ensure sufficient first school capacity in the
town for the future to meet the anticipated demand in the Buntingford area.Chapter 6 . Buntingford

Chapter 7 Hertford
7.1 Introduction
7.1.1 The County town of Hertford lies at the confluence of four rivers in a valley setting,
which in the past has influenced its shape and form. Hertford’s boundaries are
characterisedbyareasofopenlandwhichpenetratetowardsthecentreofthetown.
These ‘Green Fingers’ are an environmental asset of value to local people and
visitors alike. The town also benefits from many cultural and recreational facilities.
7.1.2 Hertford’s town centre retains much of its medieval core, includes many buildings
of historic significance, and has high townscape quality which, combined with its
river setting, presents both opportunities and constraints in shaping its future
development. The town offers an attractive environment for leisure and business
purposes and, with its retail offer characterised both by major multiples and
independentoutlets,HertfordisclassedasaSecondaryTownCentre.TheHertford
Town Centre Urban Design Strategy, 2016, seeks to build on this and includes
proposals to improve the commercial viability and vitality of the central area and to
further enhance the quality of the built environment. The redevelopment of the
Bircherley Green centre will be a key part of this approach.
7.1.3 Thetownhasgoodtransportconnections,includingabusstation,providingaccess
to both local and long-distance destinations, and two railway stations, offering
services into London and wider locales. Despite good road links, traffic congestion
in Hertford is acute at peak times, both within the historic core and especially on
the A414 Gascoyne Way, which bi-sects the town. It is important to ensure that
future development should not exacerbate this situation, and mitigating measures
should be identified and delivered, where possible.
7.1.4 Good use has been made in the past of brownfield opportunities in the town and,
despite this being a shrinking resource, the vacant former gas works site in the
Mead Lane area presents a prime redevelopment opportunity and is expected to
be brought forward for mixed use development. The Mead Lane Urban Design
Framework(December2014)willguidetheapproachtodevelopmentinthislocation.
7.1.5 As there has been some loss of employment in the town in recent years, it is
importantthatthetownshouldseektomaintainandimproveonitscurrentprovision,
tobothinternalisetripswithintheHertfordandWareareatominimiseout-commuting,
and also to encourage new businesses to locate to the County town.
7.1.6 The main components of the development strategy for Hertford are as follows:
7.1.7 Housing : a mix of dwelling types and sizes will be constructed in appropriate
locations to ensure that Hertford’s population will be able to access a balanced
housing market catering for all life stages. The provision of affordable housing as
partofanynewresidentialormixedusedevelopmentschemeswillallowemerging
households to be able to remain living in Hertford in accommodation suited to their
needs.Chapter 7 . Hertford

7.1.8 Design: collaborativelypreparedMasterplansfordevelopmentinHertford(atsites
HERT2, HERT3, HERT4 and HERT5) will form an important part of the delivery of
the site allocations. These Masterplans will provide a strong framework for the
development, which will also embody the use of design codes. This will ensure the
highest quality design and layout of each area and provide a comprehensive
approachtothewholedevelopment,whilstreflectingdifferentcharacterareasacross
the sites. The Masterplans will accord with the provisions of Policy DES1
(Masterplanning).
7.1.9 Education : since the provision of an all-through school facility at Simon Balle in
2015 addressed a previous shortfall of spaces in Hertford, any future additional
primary level educational needs of the town will be achieved via the expansion of
existingfacilities.SecondaryeducationalprovisionintheHertfordandWareSchools
PlanningAreawillbeenhancedviatheprovisionofanewsecondaryschoolaspart
of development to the North and East of Ware, and, where appropriate, by the
expansion of one or more of the existing schools in the Schools Planning Area .
7.1.10 Transport : the provision of enhanced bus services to support travel to and from
new urban extensions to the town will provide links with the two existing railway
stations and the central bus station. New development will support improved
sustainabletravelandwillaiddeliveryofinitiativescontainedinHertfordshire’sLocal
Transport Plan 4 and daughter documents, particularly those schemes detailed in

employment offer should be supplemented by the creation of additional jobs in
suitable locations. The retail function of the town will be maintained and
supplementedwithinthecentralcore,inlinewiththeprovisionsoftheHertfordTown

7.1.13 Character : Hertford will preserve its market town character and the quality of the
town’s historic core will be respected in new development proposals. Where

Development will be expected to support the Panshanger Country Park, to enable
protection of, and increased public access to, this valuable resource.

7.3 Employment in Hertford
7.3.1 The county town of Hertford retains its traditional brewing role, albeit on a reduced
basis from that of bygone times. The town has evolved its employment base over
time to reflect changing needs and currently contains a broad spectrum of
employment from industrial to prestige office accommodation with varying sized
enterprises in its employment areas.
7.3.2 Hertford’s location in relation to accessing the major road network means that it is
an attractive place for businesses to locate; however, the A414 has a propensity
towards congestion, especially at peak times, which can affect ease of access to
some areas and will require mitigation in line with the provisions of Hertfordshire
CountyCouncil’sLocalTransportPlan4.Itiscurrentlyproposedthatthiswillinclude
provision of a Hertford bypass to address identified constraints on the A414 in
combination with Sustainable Travel Town initiatives.
7.3.3 Hertford benefits from having the District’s largest local authority employer,
Hertfordshire County Council, located in the town. Other public and private sector
employment premises also lie in close proximity to County Hall.
7.3.4 In order to continue to provide opportunities for businesses to serve the town and
nearby settlements in the surrounding area, the strategy will be to protect and
enhance the existing employment areas in Hertford and to supplement this by the
formaldesignationofthePegsLaneareawhichhaslongbeeninemploymentuse.

7.5 Leisure and Community Facilities in Hertford
7.5.1 Hertford is located within an extremely attractive rural setting with unique areas of
open land, known as ‘Green Fingers’, which penetrate towards the centre of the
town. While benefiting from these assets, Hertford’s provision of public access, as
well as the provision of space for children could be improved. Therefore, where
possible, better public access to the countryside that surrounds the settlement
should be created to support both existing and new communities in the town.
Proposals for the development of the HERT3, HERT4 and HERT5 policy areas
should therefore assist in this respect, through increased public access to

Sawbridgeworth
Chapter 8 Sawbridgeworth
8.1 Introduction
8.1.1 Sawbridgeworth is an attractive and historic market town lying to the west of the
River Stort, which forms part of the County boundary with neighbouring Essex.
Although located in close proximity to Bishop’s Stortford to the north and Harlow to
thesouth,Sawbridgeworthhasastronganddistinctidentity.Nevertheless,thetown
has strong links with these neighbouring settlements, particularly in terms of
employment opportunities, with a number of residents also commuting to London
and Cambridge using the town’s railway link.
8.1.2 ResidentsofSawbridgeworthbenefitfromaccesstohighqualitypublicgreenspaces,
particularly Pishiobury Park, a designated parkland which was one of Capability
Brown’s final projects. The historic commercial core of the town is centred on Bell
Street, which lies on an east-west axis running from the 13th Century church of St
Mary’s to London Road, the old stage-coach route that runs north to south. Much
of the town centre lies within a Conservation Area and many of the buildings are
listed for their historic significance and date from the Tudor, Stuart and Georgian
periods.
8.1.3 The medieval core of the town is an attractive location which supports local
independent retailers, but it also acts as a constraint to larger retailers. The town
has only one small supermarket, meaning that a lot of larger shopping trips are
conductedoutsidethetown.SawbridgeworthisthereforeregardedasaMinorTown
Centre.
8.1.4 Being one of the smaller towns in the District, with a predominance of residential
development, there is not much potential for brownfield redevelopment within
Sawbridgeworth. Therefore, any large scale residential development would of
necessity involve Green Belt release. To meet the need for additional housing in
Sawbridgeworth, two sites are proposed for development to the west of the town,
and one to the north.
8.1.5 The main components of the development strategy for Sawbridgeworth are as
follows:
8.1.6 Housing : additional homes will be provided which will consist of a mix of dwelling
types and sizes to ensure that Sawbridgeworth’s population is able to access a
balanced housing market catering for all life stages. The provision of affordable
housing will allow emerging households to remain living in Sawbridgeworth in
accommodation suited to their needs.
8.1.7 Education : the educational needs of the town will be met at primary level via the
expansionofMandevilleSchoolto2formsofentry.Secondaryeducationalprovision
will be enhanced by the construction of a new school, in the Bishop’s Stortford
School Planning Area within which Sawbridgeworth falls.Chapter 8 . Sawbridgeworth
110
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
8.1.8 Transport :newdevelopmentwillencouragetheuseofsustainabletravel,particularly
through the enhancement of walking and cycling links. The impact of development
on the local road network will be mitigated through upgrades to existing junctions
and the provision of a new Junction 7a on the M11 which will reduce pressure on
theA1184.ConsiderationwillneedtobegiventotheAirQualityManagementArea
(AQMA) which is located in the London Road area. The AQMA is supported by an
action plan which seeks to improve air quality in this location.
8.1.9 Economic Development : Sawbridgeworth’s limited employment offer will be
maintained to support local scale employment opportunities. As a Minor Town
Centre, Sawbridgeworth’s retail offer in the central core will be maintained and
strengthened if suitable opportunities arise to serve both the town’s residents and
its local rural hinterland.
8.1.10 Character : Sawbridgeworth’s market town character and the heritage qualities of
the town’s historic core will be maintained. New development will respect both the
local and wider landscape character and will enhance Sawbridgeworth’s green
infrastructure, through the provision of new public open space.
8.1.11 Design: collaboratively prepared Masterplans for development in Sawbridgeworth
(at sites SAWB2, SAWB3 and SAWB4) will form an important part of the delivery
of the site allocations. These Masterplans will provide a strong framework for the
development, which will ensure the highest quality design and layout of each area
and provide a comprehensive approach to the development as a whole, whilst
reflecting different character areas across the sites. The Masterplans will accord
with the provisions of Policy DES1 (Masterplanning).

Ware
Chapter 9 Ware
9.1 Introduction
9.1.1 Ware is an ancient historic market town, which has developed in a valley setting
around a crossing point of the River Lea. Much of the town’s historic town centre
originates from medieval times, with the Grade I listed buildings St Mary’s Church
(13thCentury)and Ware Priory(also a ScheduledMonument)being locatedatthe
western end of the High Street, and many other listed buildings in the central core.
Past coaching and malting industry ties particularly influenced the evolution of the
town’s urban form and led to the emergence of its burgage plots and famous 18th
Century gazebos along the river.
9.1.2 Inthepast,theriverhasunderpinnedthetown’seconomicfunction,butisnowmore

Lea at The Priory. The Lee Valley Regional Park, which bounds the south of the
town, along with other woodland and countryside access opportunities are also
available to Ware’s residents and visitors.
9.1.3 Within the town centre, while the town’s historic pattern of development coupled

base; most notably, with the district’s largest single employer, GSK, being located
in the town and through other employment sites of varying age and quality which
offer a range of accommodation to businesses. It is considered important that the
town’s existing employment sites are retained in order to provide local jobs in
sustainable locations for residents of Ware and its surrounding areas.

this has been a particularly successful approach, it means that brownfield
opportunities have largely been exhausted. Therefore, Green Belt release for any
large scale residential development is necessitated.

thatWare’sinfrastructurewillbeabletosatisfactorilyabsorbtheadditionalpopulation
and its requirements, whilst ensuring that the town’s unique historic character and
sense of place is maintained.
9.1.7 The main components of the development strategy for Ware are as follows:
9.1.8 Housing: additional homes will be provided, the majority to the North and East of
Ware(WARE2),whichwillconsistofamixofdwellingtypesandsizesthatwillhave
been constructed in appropriate locations to ensure that Ware’s population is able
to access a balanced housing market catering for all life stages. The provision of
affordable housing as part of any new residential or mixed use development
scheme/s will allow emerging households to be able to remain living in Ware in
accommodation suited to their needs. The site will also provide for the
accommodation needs of Travelling Showpeople and make provision for self-build
and/or custom-build opportunities.
9.1.9 Design: a collaboratively prepared Masterplan for the development of the North
and East of Ware (WARE2) will form an important part of the delivery of the site
allocation.ThisMasterplan,incorporatingGardenCitydesignprinciples,willprovide
a strong framework for the development, which will also embody the use of design
codes.Thiswillensurethehighestqualitydesignandlayoutoftheareaandprovide
a comprehensive and unified approach to the whole development, whilst reflecting
different character areas across the site. The Masterplan will accord with the
provisions of Policy DES1 Masterplanning.
9.1.10 Education: the educational needs of the town will be achieved at primary level via
the provision of one or more new schools commensurate with the level of
development delivered to the North and East of Ware (WARE2), and, potentially,
by the expansion of existing facilities. Secondary educational provision will be
enhanced via the expansion of one or more of the existing schools in the Hertford
and Ware Schools Planning Area and via the construction of a new school (which
could potentially be an all-through facility) of at least six forms of entry to the North
and East of the town. Hertford Regional College will continue to provide further
educational opportunities for students from both Ware and wider locales.
9.1.11 Community Facilities: in addition to the continuation of existing facilities, new
homes to the North and East of Ware (WARE2) will be supported by a range of
community facilities which will be located around a neighbourhood centre.Chapter 9 . Ware

VI. In order to ensure that the site is planned and delivered comprehensively, any
application for development on part of the site will be assessed against its contribution
to the Masterplan, and will ensure that such development would not prejudice the
implementation of the site allocation as a whole.

9.4 Retail in Ware
9.4.1 Classed as a Minor Town Centre, Ware caters for a mixture of shopping and other
service needs, both for its own residents and those of surrounding settlements.
While it has a low preponderance of national multiple A1 retailers (Tesco, Boots
and Peacocks) and therefore lacks the draw that these stores bring (ASDA lies
outside of the town centre boundary), Ware is supported by the high quality of its
independent stores, weekly market, and also on its higher than average food and
drink offer.
9.4.2 Ware also benefits from local parades and individual shops within some of its
residentialareas,whichprovidevaluablefacilitiesforlocalpeopleandpassingtrade
in addition to the retail offer in the town centre.
9.4.3 There is considered to be limited opportunity for expanding the retail offer in Ware
other than via the provision of local shopping facilities within the proposed
development to the North and East of Ware allocation. It is vital that such facilities
shouldbeofalocalnaturewithenoughprovisiontoensureasustainablecommunity,
without diverting trade from the town centre, where the retail offer will continue to

10.1 Introduction
10.1.1 East Herts is a rural district, characterised by a dispersed settlement pattern of
market towns, and over a hundred villages and hamlets reflecting thousands of
yearsofhumanactivityinthearea.Thishasresultedinavaluableheritageinterms
of the built environment, with 37 villages benefitting from designated Conservation
Areas which befit their unique historic character.
10.1.2 Whilstvillagesoriginallygrewasfarmingsettlements,changesinagriculturalpractice
have meant that there are fewer jobs on the land and many villages have become
dormitory or commuter villages that house residents who work and socialise
elsewhere.
10.1.3 Historically, the planning system has viewed villages in the context of the wider
countryside and as such, has applied a general policy of restraint that seeks to
protect the countryside (and therefore villages) from development.
10.1.4 Thispolicyofrestraint,whilstpreservingthesettingofthevillagesinopencountryside

is crucial to maintaining a thriving rural community. Rural housing is considered to
be essential to ensure viable use of local facilities.
10.1.5 Therefore, the development strategy for the villages seeks to balance the need to
ensurevitalandviableruralcommunities,withthedesiretoconservethecountryside.
ThePlanclassifiesvillagesintothreegroups,throughavillagehierarchy,reflecting
their relative sustainability. This is an important element of the strategy, helping to

10.1.6 Villages have been classified following an assessment of:
the range of services and facilities that are present in each village;
the village’s accessibility to higher order settlements; and
the level of public transport provision available.

to give local communities greater power to shape their neighbourhood by taking a
more active role in the development of planning policies at a local level.
10.2.2 A Neighbourhood Plan allows communities to create both a vision and planning
policies for the use and development of land in their village. For example,
communities can identify where new homes should be built, what they should look
like and identify local infrastructure needs.
10.2.3 TheDistrictCouncilwantstogiveParishCouncilstheopportunitytoempowerlocal
people to take a proactive role in shaping the future of the areas in which they live,
and give local people greater ownership of the plans and policies that affect their
localarea.InaccordancewithPolicyVILL1(Group1Villages),ParishCouncilswill
therefore be encouraged to prepare Neighbourhood Plans, in accordance with the
provisions of the District Plan, to allocate land for development or to introduce
additional policy requirements aimed at ensuring that development contributes
toward local distinctiveness or other community objectives. Other Parish Councils

10.3 Development in the Villages
10.3.1 In accordance with Policy DPS3 (Housing Supply 2011-2033) Group 1 Villages will
together accommodate at least 500 new homes, between 2017-2033.
10.3.2 Group 1 Villages are the most sustainable villages in the District. In these villages
development for housing, employment, leisure, recreation and community facilities
willbepermitted.Growthintheseareaswillhelptosustainexistingshops,services

10.3.3 Having regard to the need to promote sustainable patterns of development, and to
ensuredeliveryoftheoverallhousingrequirementforthevillages,Group1Villages
will need to accommodate at least a 10% increase in housing stock (based on the
2011Census)overthe16-yearperiodbetween1stApril2017and31stMarch2033.
Thisisalevelofhousinggrowththatisconsideredfair,achievableandsustainable
for each of the settlementsconcerned and that will make a meaningful contribution
towards alleviating future housing demands, addressing local housing needs and
supporting the village economy. Table 10.1 shows the minimum number of homes
that each village will need to accommodate. However, development in excess of
theminimumnumberindicated,maybeconsideredappropriate,dependingonsite
availability, site suitability and upon the capacity of infrastructure to meet the
additional demand that arises.Chapter 10 . Villages

10.3.4 Parish Councils will be encouraged to produce a Neighbourhood Plan to develop
a shared vision for their village and to deliver the sustainable development they
need (including housing, employment and leisure, recreation and community
facilities). Neighbourhood Plans must be in general conformity with the strategic
policies in this Plan.
10.3.5 In order to accommodate at least a 10% increase in housing stock, village
development boundaries in Group 1 Villages located in the Rural Area Beyond the
Green Belt may need to be amended through Neighbourhood Plans.
10.3.6 The villages of Hertford Heath, Stanstead Abbotts & St Margarets, and

10.3.11 Group 3 Villages are generally amongst the smallest in East Herts. These villages
have a poor range of services and facilities and it is often necessary for local
residents to travel outside the village for most of their daily needs. These villages
generally lack a primary school or local convenience shop and may not have a
permanent post office or a village hall or meeting place. However, whilst Group 3

The Gilston Area
Chapter 11 The Gilston Area
11.1 Introduction
11.1.1 The Gilston Area is located to the north of the Stort Valley, in close proximity to the
New Town of Harlow. It is characterised by an area of undulating countryside with
anumberoffeaturesincludingsmallstreams,woods,hedgerows,andthehistorically
important Gilston Park. A number of small settlements are located adjacent to the
Gilston Area, including the villages of Hunsdon, Eastwick and Gilston.
11.1.2 Development in this location provides a unique opportunity to deliver a strategic
sized sustainable development that will provide for a significant proportion of the
District’s housing needs, both within this Plan period and beyond. As such, the
GilstonAreaisallocatedforatotalof10,000newhomes,withapproximately3,000
homes to be delivered in the Plan period, along with a significant amount of
supportinginfrastructureincludingroadsandsustainabletransportprovision,schools,

beyond 2033 will help to ensure that Green Belt boundaries will not need to be
reviewedagaininthislocation,andwillalsoreducepressuretoprovidedevelopment
in and around existing settlements in the next Plan period.
11.1.3 Given its proximity to Harlow and its railway stations, residents of the Gilston Area
willhaveaccesstosubstantialemploymentopportunitiesbothwithinthetownitself,
and further afield. As well as providing benefits to East Herts, the development will
support the regeneration of Harlow by helping to draw investment to the town and
enhance its economic performance.
11.1.4 AConceptFrameworkisbeingjointlypreparedbythelandowners,theCounciland
the local community, which identifies design principles, potential land uses,
infrastructure requirements and phasing, and will be used as a benchmark in
reviewing proposals for development.
11.2 Harlow and Gilston Garden Town
11.2.1 East Herts Council, Harlow Council and Epping Forest District Council are working
in partnership together with Hertfordshire County Council, Essex County Council,
HertfordshireLocalEnterprisePartnership,SouthEastLocalEnterprisePartnership,
land owners and promoters to bring forward transformational growth in the Harlow
area.
11.2.2 On 2 January 2017, the Government announced its support for the Harlow and
Gilston Garden Town. The Councils share a bold vision and set of objectives,
recognising that areas in and around Harlow present a number of opportunities to
deliver growth of considerable scale and significance. Such growth is key, not only
to meet growing pressures of housing and infrastructure need locally, but also to
delivering broader regeneration and change for Harlow.Chapter 11 . The Gilston Area

economic growth, whilst ensuring it remains an attractive place for people to live
and locate to.
11.2.4 The Garden Town will comprise various new developments in the wider Harlow
area, within the three local authority areas. The Gilston Area forms a key part of
this ambitious project. As such, the proposals for the Gilston Area should
complement, and have regard to, ongoing work relating to the Garden Town.
11.3 Development in the Gilston Area
11.3.1 The main components of the development strategy for the Gilston Area are as
follows:
11.3.2 Housing : development in this location will provide a mixture of house sizes and
tenures across seven distinct villages, including affordable housing and homes for
older people. The site will also provide for the accommodation needs of Gypsies
and Travellers and Travelling Showpeople and make provision for self-build and/or
custom build opportunities.
11.3.3 Education : the site will deliver land for twenty forms of entry for both primary and
secondary education in order to fully cater for the needs arising from the
development. Early Years Education will also be provided for.
11.3.4 Transport :awiderangeofsmallandlargescaleinterventionsincludingsustainable
transportmeasures,willberequiredtoensurethatdevelopmentinthewiderHarlow
area, including the Gilston Area, is able to proceed without causing unacceptable
congestion in Harlow and the surrounding towns and villages, as well as the wider
strategic transport network. These interventions include a new Junction 7a on the
M11, upgrades to Junctions 7 & 8, a second River Stort crossing, widening of the
existing crossing, and upgrades to the Amwell Roundabout. Sustainable transport
measures will also be required including new bus services, connecting to Harlow
and the wider area, as well as provision for walking and cycling.
11.3.5 CommunityFacilities :theGilstonAreawillprovidenewcommunityfacilitiesbased
around a network of village centres. The facilities will include community meeting
spaces, libraries and sport and recreation facilities. A range of local shops will also
be provided, along with healthcare centres which will accommodate both family
doctorsandotherhealthservicessuchasdentists,pharmacies,physiotherapyand
outpatient services. Consideration will also be given to the potential of the site to
facilitate the re-location of the Princess Alexandra Hospital.
11.3.6 Employment :thedevelopmentwillprovidelocalemployment,includingsmallscale
office space. This will be in the form of either a business park of 5ha or distributed
across the village centres having regard to Garden City principles. Residents willChapter 11 . The Gilston Area

also be able to access more substantial employment opportunities within Harlow,
including the Enterprise Zone. The proximity of the site to Harlow Town station will
alsoenablesustainableaccesstoemploymentopportunitiesfurtherafield,including
Stansted Airport, Cambridge, Bishop’s Stortford and London.
11.3.7 Open Space : The site allocation covers a large geographical area. However, only
the south and south eastern sections of the site will be developed. In addition to
development, this part of the site will deliver new green spaces including sports
pitches, parks and recreation areas. Within the north and north western sections
of the site, a substantial amount of public open space as part of wider managed
parklands including continuing farming will be provided. This area will therefore
remain undeveloped, with the exception of a small number of buildings associated
with its recreational use. A community land trust, or other governance mechanism
as appropriate, will be established in order to deliver local ownership and
managementoftheseassets.Thisshouldtakeplaceearlyintheoveralldevelopment

buffers will be provided in order to maintain the distinct identities of Eastwick and
Gilston villages within the context of the overall development.
11.3.9 Heritage : The site contains a number of heritage assets, including listed buildings
and Scheduled Monuments. The development will be designed in order to ensure
thattheseassetsandtheirsettingsareconservedand,whereappropriate,enhanced
within the context of the overall development, through appropriate mitigation
measures, having regard to the Heritage Impact Assessment (Montagu Evans,
October 2017). Gilston Park (the designed landscape), a locally important historic
asset, is also located within the Gilston Area. Development will be designed to
respect this asset.
11.3.10 Ecology and Environment : The development will retain and protect important

11.4 The River Stort Crossings
11.4.1 The greater Harlow area is forecast to experience significant housing and
employment growth during the plan period. The A414 corridor is already under
pressure. Potential improvements are being explored along the wider corridor, and
a new junction on the M11 is being promoted by Essex County Council (Junction
7a). In order to provide capacity to meet the wider needs of the existing residents
and businesses, and future growth, the connectivity over the River Stort needs to
be improved. Schemes have previously been designed for improvements to the
existing A414 crossing at Eastwick.
11.4.2 Additional crossing options are also being reviewed, both to the east and the west
of the existing crossing. New crossings both to the east and west are feasible, but
deliver different benefits. The eastern crossing is the option preferred by Essex
County Council as it provides relief to junctions along the western end of the A414
Edinburgh Way in Harlow, and enhances access to the Enterprise Zone and links
through, potentially, to the proposed new motorway Junction 7a. Any application

12.1 Introduction
12.1.1 Stevenage is a Mark I New Town designated in 1946 as part of the Abercrombie
plan for the establishment of settlements around London. The town has grown in
several stages, shaped originally around six distinct neighbourhoods, each with a
neighbourhood centre and local schools. The town is bordered to the west by the
A1(M),whichfacilitatedthegrowthofanextensiveemploymentcorridoratGunnels
Wood. As such, Stevenage is home to many large corporations and a wide variety
of small to medium sized employers, making the town a key destination and
employment centre.
12.1.2 A site of approximately 37 hectares of land to the east of Gresley Way, Stevenage
is therefore allocated for development in the East Herts District Plan, to deliver at
least600homeswithinthefirstsixyearsofthePlanperiod.Thesitewillbereferred
to as Gresley Park.
12.1.3 As the development abuts the edge of Stevenage, the site will need to be planned
in collaboration with Stevenage Borough Council. However, as the site is wholly
within the administrative boundary of East Herts District, East Herts Council is the
relevantLocalPlanningAuthority.Nonetheless,theCouncilwillworkwithStevenage

12.2 Development East of Stevenage
12.2.1 ThemaincomponentsofthedevelopmentstrategyforlandtotheeastofStevenage
at Gresley Park are as follows:
12.2.2 Housing : Stevenage is home to many large employers and is a key employment
destination for residents in East Herts. As such, housing to the east of Stevenage
is well located in relation to the services and employment in the town and would
contribute towards meeting the East Herts District housing needs. The site will
provide a new neighbourhood comprising a mixture of house sizes and tenure,
including affordable homes, a care home and homes for older people. Stevenage
Borough Council’s regeneration ambitions would be supported by dwellings which
areattractivetoworkerswhowouldotherwiselookoutsidethetownfortheirhousing
needs. The site will also provide for the accommodation needs of Travelling
Showpeople and make provision for self-build and/or custom-build opportunities.
12.2.3 Education : the site will provide a two form entry primary school with Early Years
Education facilities. This will meet the educational needs arising from the
development as well as providing additional capacity to address wider needs.

12.2.5 Mitigation will be required on the highway network, including improvements to the
Gresley Way/A602 junction and other local roads as necessary. The development
will need to ensure that existing Bridleways (Aston 004 and Aston 021) are
maintained and new routes are provided to connect the site to Stevenage to the
west and to the wider countryside to the east.
12.2.6 Other Infrastructure : waste water will drain to Rye Meads, and new waste water
services will be created as part of the development to ensure that the efficiency of
the network is maintained and there are no adverse effects on surrounding
watercourses. Sustainable drainage features will also be required on the site. In
addition,aservicedareaoflandwillberequiredtoaccommodateasiteforTravelling

anddistinctivetown.Thetown’slocationwithintheA1(M)corridormeansitishighly
accessible and as such is home to regionally important employment areas and
national headquarters of large businesses. The town and the borough is a key
workplace and retail destination for East Herts residents. This results in strong
economic and housing market links between Welwyn Hatfield and East Herts.
13.1.2 Land to the East of Welwyn Garden City was assessed through the Plan-making
process and was identified as a Broad Location for Development. This meant that
theprincipleofdevelopmentinthislocationwasreservedsubjecttofurtherdetailed
assessmentswhichwouldbeconsideredthroughtheproductionofaDevelopment
Plan Document.
13.1.3 Since the Preferred Options consultation, East Herts and Welwyn Hatfield Council
Officers have undertaken technical assessments to assess the feasibility and
suitability of development in this location. This is documented in the Settlement
Appraisal.
13.1.4 Consequently, land to the East of Welwyn Garden City at Birchall Garden Suburb
is allocated for development in both the East Herts District Plan, and the Welwyn
Hatfield Local Plan to accommodate 2,550 new homes over the Plan period. 1,350
homes will be in East Herts and 1,200 homes will be in Welwyn Hatfield Borough.
13.1.5 As the development straddles the boundary between the two authorities the site
will be planned in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner. East Herts Council,
WelwynHatfieldCouncilandHertfordshireCountyCouncil(initscapacityasminerals
and waste planning, education and highways authority) will work together with
landownersandotherkeystakeholderstoproduceamasterplanforBirchallGarden
Suburb, which can be adopted as a Supplementary Planning Document to provide
a clear basis upon which future planning applications will be considered. The
masterplan will set out the detailed phasing of delivery across the site, but
development will commence within the first five years of the Plan period.
13.2 Development East of Welwyn Garden City
13.2.1 The main components of the development strategy for land to the East of Welwyn
Garden City at Birchall Garden Suburb subject to masterplanning are expected to
focus on the following:
13.2.2 Housing and Community Facilities: The development will comprise a mix of
tenures,includingaffordableandaspirationalhomesaswellasspecialistresidential
provisionforolderpeople(suchasretirementbungalowsandapartments,flexi-care
and residential care homes). In addition, a site will also be provided for GypsiesChapter 13 . East of Welwyn Garden City
168
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
and Travellers. Development within the East Herts part of the site to the north of
BirchallLane will be a more compacturban form,while land tothesouthofBirchall
Lane is likely to take the form of connected villages in order to fit well within the
landscape.
13.2.3 Thenewhomeswillbesupportedbyarangeofcommunityfacilitieslocatedaround
two neighbourhood centres (one in East Herts and one in Welwyn Hatfield). The
larger neighbourhood centre will be located to the north of Birchall Lane where
access can be achieved from the main road. A smaller local centre will be located
to the south of the site where it can be co-located with the primary school, thus
creating a natural centre to the development.
13.2.4 Education: Landforatwo-formentryprimaryschoolwithearlyyearsprovision,will
be located within the Welwyn Hatfield part of the site, while land for a three-form
entry primary school, with early years provision, will be provided on the East Herts
part of the site, along with land for the provision of an eight-form entry secondary
school.
13.2.5 Character and Design: Welwyn Garden City is well known for its Garden City
design principles and this will provide a strong framework for the development,
whichwillbesecuredthroughtheuseofdesigncodesandacollaborativelyprepared
masterplan. This will ensure the highest quality design and layout and a
comprehensive and unified approach to the whole development, albeit reflecting
different character areas across the site. Connections will be enhanced between
the development site to the environmental assets such as Panshanger Park and
the River Lea and Mimram corridors.
13.2.6 Heritage: Important heritage assets within and in the vicinity of the site will be
protectedthroughadequatemitigationwhichwillincludetheprovisionoflandscaped
buffers, and maintaining open or landscaped areas where necessary. Land uses
which can contribute towards maintaining these buffers will be located where
required, such as locating the all through-school or public open space or sports
pitches to the eastern edge of the site where the built form can provide a clear
boundary, with the visually less intrusive features of the playing fields contributing

Valley and the Grade II Registered Panshanger Park. To the south-east, the A414
makes a clear Green Belt boundary and will be screened by the creation of new
landscape features.
13.2.9 Transport: An important aspect of the development will be its connectivity within
the site and to the existing town. Walking and cycling and bus connectivity will be
prioritised over car users to encourage a shift towards more sustainable means of
transport. Existing Rights of Way will be enhanced, improving links within the site
andtothecountrysidebeyond.ThedevelopmentwillmakeimprovementstoNational
Cycle Route 61 (a disused railway line known as the Cole Green Way), and will
create new cycle networks providing connections within and around the site for
leisure and commuter cycling trips to and from the development.

for access in to Welwyn Garden City off the A414 and B195. Mitigation will be
required on the A414 junctions and improvements will be necessary to the B195,
Birchall Lane.
13.2.11 Employment: New employment land has recently been granted permission by
Welwyn Hatfield Council at the Holdings, Birchall Lane. The masterplan will seek
to increase this employment land to the site currently occupied by BP Mitchell.
Birchall Lane is a key route in to Welwyn Garden City from the east; therefore
employment space will be highly visible and will contribute towards the creation of
a new employment corridor. The area is well located for easy access to Hatfield
Business Park and the employment opportunities within Welwyn Garden City and
Hertford.Therewillalsobeemploymentopportunitieswithinthetwoneighbourhood
centres provided as part of the development and within the schools.
13.2.12 Waste Water Infrastructure: Waste water will drain to Rye Meads Waste Water
Treatment Works, and new waste water services will be created as part of the
development to ensure that the efficiency of the network is maintained and there
are no adverse effects on surrounding watercourses.

III. A joint masterplan setting out the quantum and distribution of land uses, key views
to protect heritage assets, access, sustainable design and layout principles will be
prepared by Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council and East Herts District Council, working
with the landowner and other key stakeholders. The Masterplan, which will be informedChapter 13 . East of Welwyn Garden City

14.1 Introduction
14.1.1 A key objective of the District Plan seeks to ensure that new housing is accessible
to,andmeetstheneedsandaspirationsof,theDistrict’scommunities.TheCouncil
also recognises that everyone should be given the opportunity to access a decent
home, which they can afford and is in a community where they want to live. The
Plancancontributetoachievingtheseobjectivesbyplanningforasufficientquantity,
qualityandtypeofhousingintherightlocations,takingaccountofneedanddemand
and seeking to improve choice.
14.1.2 This chapter sets out the Council’s approach to addressing the need for different
types of housing within the District up to 2033. It includes policies relating to the
type, mix and density of new housing, affordable housing, and Gypsies, Travellers
and Travelling Showpeople housing requirements.
14.2 Type and Mix of Housing
14.2.1 TheNationalPlanningPolicyFramework(NPPF)statesthatlocalplanningauthorities
should use their evidence base to ensure that their Local Plan meets the full,
objectivelyassessedneedsformarketandaffordablehousinginthehousingmarket
area. Local planning authorities should plan for a mix of housing, based on current
and demographic trends, market trends and the needs of different groups in the
community.Itgoesontosaythatlocalplanningauthoritiesshouldidentifythesize,
type, tenure and range of housing that is required in different locations.

showthattherewillbe87.5%moreolderpeople(65+)by2037.Thelargestincrease
within the 65+ group are those aged over 85, a 189.6% increase, which potentially
means a significant increase in the need for support services and housing with
support. It is therefore important that the District Plan takes a positive approach to
planning ahead for the housing issues that will arise from the ageing population.

14.3 Housing Density
14.3.1 Housing density is a measure of the amount of land used for development and is
usuallyexpressedasdwellingsperhectare(dph).Higherdensitiesallowlandtobe
usedmoreefficiently(i.e.lesslandisrequiredfordevelopment)andareconsidered
to be more sustainable. However, since higher density development is usually
associated with flats and taller buildings, the impact of increasing densities on
character must be considered.
14.3.2 The NPPF allows local planning authorities to set their own approach to housing
density. The density of housing varies across the District, and between different
sites.Factorsaffectingdensityincludeon-siteconstraints,thetypeofdevelopment
proposedandtheleveloftransportaccessibility.Higherdensitiesmaybeappropriate
inandaroundtowncentrelocationswhereservicesaresupported,publictransport
is likely to be better and urban form is dense. Lower densities may be appropriate
in established suburban areas, in villages, in areas with an open character or on
the edge of settlements.
14.3.3 TheCouncilwillexpectallhousingschemestoproposedensitieswhicharesensitive
to the character of the local area, and take account of on-site constraints and the
availability of sustainable transport options. At the same time, applicants should
also have regard to making efficient use of land, as this can help to reduce the
amount of building on greenfield sites. Major schemes should include a range of
housing density areas, to ensure varied character and appearance.
14.3.4 The density standards used in Policy HOU2 refer to average net density. This is a
normal way of expressing residential density and includes those areas which will
bedevelopedforhousinganddirectlyassociatedusessuchasaccessroadswithin
thesite,privategardenspace,carparking,incidentalopenspaceandlandscaping,
and children’s play areas.
Policy HOU2 Housing Density
I. Housing development should make efficient use of land. Proposals are required to
demonstrate how the density of new development has been informed by the character
of the local area and contributes to:
(a) The design objectives set out in Policy DES4 (Design of Development);
(b) Improving the mix of house types in accordance with Policy HOU1 (Type and
Mix of Housing); and
(c)ProvidingadequatelevelsofpublicopenspaceinaccordancewithPolicyCFLR1

14.4 Affordability and the Housing Market
14.4.1 The location of East Herts on the periphery of London means that the affordability
of housing is a key issue across the District.
14.4.2 Affordable housing is housing provided at a cost below current market rates to
eligible households, whose needs are not adequately served by the commercial
housingmarket.Forplanningpurposes,affordablehousinghasaspecificdefinition
assetbytheNPPFandiscurrentlydefinedassocialrented,affordablerentedand
intermediate housing. However, the Housing and Planning Act 2016 inserts a new
affordable housing definition into the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which
will,onceenactedthroughsecondarylegislation,amendthedefinitionofaffordable

14.4.4 In order to deliver the identified need, Policy HOU3 requires the following:
(a) up to 35% affordable housing on sites proposing 11 to 14 gross additional

recognition of the fact that not all developments will contribute to the provision of
affordable housing.

Policy HOU3 Affordable Housing
I. Affordable housing provision will be expected on all development sites that propose
development that falls within Class C3 (Dwelling Houses) as follows:
(a) up to35% on sitesproposing 10 or fewergross additionaldwellings,where the
dwellings would have a combined gross floor space greater than 1,000 square
metres;
(b) up to 35% on sites proposing 11 to 14 gross additional dwellings;
(c) up to 40% on sites proposing 15 or more gross additional dwellings.
II. Affordable Housing provision will be expected to incorporate a mix of tenures taking
account of the Council’s most up to date evidence on housing need. The Council will

III. Lower provision may be permitted if it is demonstrated that the 35% and 40%, as
appropriate referred to in I (a), (b) and (c) above, cannot be achieved due to viability
reasons or where it would prejudice the need to secure other infrastructure priorities.
Applicantsseekingtojustifyalowerpercentagelevelofaffordablehousingtothatreferred

IV. Affordable Housing should normally be provided on site, apart from in exceptional
circumstances when agreed with the Council. Applicants will be required to provide
justification as part of the planning application setting out the need for off-site provision
or financial contributions in lieu to be made.
V. The affordable housing units should be integrated into the open market housing
development using appropriate design methods, i.e. tenure blind, and ‘pepper-potted’
across the site in clusters appropriate to the size and scale of the development.14 . Housing

VI. To secure the benefits of affordable housing for first and subsequent occupiers
affordable rented and intermediate housing will be retained as affordable by means of
an appropriate legal agreement or condition with the Council, or the subsidy will be
recycled for alternative affordable housing provision.
14.5 Special Residential Uses

14.6.2 It is important that rural exception affordable housing schemes are needs led, the
starting point being that a need for affordable housing exists in the parish, rather
than the availability of a particular site. Proposed developments must be based on
sound evidence of affordable housing need and must fulfil the criteria as stated in
the policy below.

affordable housing, including rural exception affordable housing sites which meet
the criteria set out in the policy below.
Policy HOU4 Rural Exception Affordable Housing Sites
I. Proposals for rural exception affordable housing schemes, on sites that would not
normally be acceptable for general housing development, may be permitted, subject to
the following criteria:
(a) The exception site is adjacent to an existing built-up area boundary, or is well
related to existing residential development and amenities located in, or adjacent
to, a clearly identifiable village or settlement;
(b) The proposed development will contribute towards meeting an identified need
for affordable housing within the parish; and
(c) The proposed development would be appropriate to the settlement and area in
which it is proposed to be located in terms of scale, form and character.

include safeguards that the scheme provides for the identified local affordable housing
need and will continue to do so in perpetuity.

Policy HOU5 Dwellings for Rural Workers
I. The Council will only permit permanent dwellings for agriculture, forestry and other
rural businesses where:
(a)Itcanbedemonstratedthatthedwellingisessentialtotheneedsofthebusiness
(i.e. there is a need for one or more workers to be available at most times);
(b) It can be demonstrated that the enterprise has been established for at least
three years and is, and should remain financially viable;
(c) There is no other accommodation within the site/holding or in the locality which
is currently suitable and available, or could be made available.
II. The proposed dwelling must be sensitively designed and in keeping with its rural
surroundings.
III. Where a new dwelling is permitted, the occupancy will be restricted by condition to
ensure that it is occupied by a person or persons currently employed, or last employed,
in agriculture, forestry or other rural business, or a widow or widower of such a person,
and to any residents dependants.
IV. Applications for the removal of an occupancy condition related to rural workers will
only be permitted in exceptional circumstances where it can be demonstrated that:
(a) There is no longer a need for the accommodation for agricultural, forestry or
other rural workers on the holding/business and in the local area;
(b) The dwelling has been marketed for a reasonable period (at least 12 months)
and at a price which reflects the existence of the occupancy condition;14 . Housing

(c) The dwelling cannot make a contribution towards meeting local affordable
housing needs in the area.
14.8 Housing for Older and Vulnerable People
14.8.1 Nationalpolicyrequireslocalauthoritiestomeetthespecificaccommodationneeds
ofolderandvulnerablepeople.ItisimportantthattheCouncil,workingwithpartners
such as the County Council, Registered Providers, health care agencies, and
developers, seeks to plan for increasing housing choices in terms of specialist
accommodation for older and vulnerable people. Offering attractive alternative
housing choices for older people and vulnerable groups will assist in freeing-up
family sized homes that are currently under-occupied.
14.8.2 There is, therefore, a need to provide suitable accommodation for various groups
ofpeople,includingtheelderly,peoplewithdisabilitiesandvulnerablepeople.This
covers a range of housing types, from accessible and adaptable general needs
housingtothefullrangeofretirementandspecialisedhousingforthosewithsupport
or care needs.
14.8.3 The Government’s reform of Health and Adult Social Care is underpinned by a
principle of sustaining people at home as long as possible. Therefore,
accommodation for the elderly is moving towards more flexible forms of living and
support,whichseektomaintainpeople’sindependence.Thereareseveraloptions
whereresidentscanenjoytheirownself-containedhomewithinasiteofferingextra

14.8.4 The Council will require that all development schemes provide accessible and
adaptable homes to meet the changing needs of occupants over their lifetime, and
willencouragetheprovisionofspecialisttypesofretirementhousing(withintheC3
Use Class), such as sheltered housing and flexi-care housing, as part of the
development of larger sites. Consideration should also be given to the provision of
bungalows which have been identified as a preferred housing type by many older
people in the District.
14.8.5 Peoplewhoareunabletoliveindependentlyrequirespecialistresidentialornursing
care accommodation. This type of accommodation usually falls within the C2 Use
Class. It is important to note that the objectively assessed housing need (OAN) for
the District does not include the projected increase of the institutional population.
The SHMA (2015) identifies the projected growth in population aged 75 or over
living in communal establishments in the District, as 529 persons, between
2011-2033.
14.8.6 Therefore, in addition to the overall housing target, this Plan supports a gross
increase of at least 530 bed-spaces of C2 provision, primarily to help meet the
accommodation needs of older people who need to live in an environment which14 . Housing
190
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
providesresidentialornursingcare.However,otherpeopleincludingyoungpeople,
people with physical disabilities or sensory needs, people with learning difficulties
and other vulnerable people may also require specialist accommodation.
14.8.7 Specialist types of retirement housing and specialist residential and nursing care
accommodation should normally be located within settlementswhere there is easy
access to a range of services e.g. shops, healthcare facilities, social facilities, and
sustainable transport options.
14.8.8 As people’s housing needs change over their lifetimes, it is important to promote
the construction of flexible, adaptable and accessible homes that can respond to
the changing needs of individuals and families at different stages of life at minimal
cost. Therefore, it makes practical, social and economic sense to incorporate

14.8.10 The SHMA (2015) identifies that evidence supports the need for all new dwellings
to meet Category 2 requirements (accessible and adaptable dwellings), and the
need for 10% of market housing and 15% of affordable housing to meet Category
3 requirements (wheelchair user dwellings), provided that the overall viability of a
development scheme is not compromised.

a policy requiring wheelchair accessible dwellings should only be applied to those
dwellings where the local authority is responsible for allocating or nominating a
person to live in that dwelling. Therefore, the Council will negotiate a proportion of
wheelchairadaptable(marketandaffordablehousing)and/orwheelchairaccessible
(affordable housing only) dwellings on sites proposing 11 or more additional
dwellings, as appropriate.14 . Housing

I. The Council will encourage the provision of specialist housing, across all tenures, for
olderandvulnerablepeople.Proposalsfornewhousingforolderandvulnerablepeople
will be expected to:
(a) Provide a range of accommodation size, tenure and type with the opportunity
to attain additional or specialist care as needed within the one development;
(b) Be in a suitable location where access to a choice of sustainable travel options
is available;
(c) Be within walking distance, on a safe and level route or within easy reach by
passenger transport, to town centre shops and services;
(d) Be well integrated with existing communities through the sharing of space and
public access to services where appropriate;
(e) Consider the integration of healthcare facilities within the development.
II. In addition to the overall housing target, a gross increase of at least 530 bed-spaces
to help meet the accommodation needs of those who need specialist (Use Class C2)
residential or nursing care will be supported in the District’s towns.
Policy HOU7 Accessible and Adaptable Homes
I. In order to ensure delivery of new homes that are readily accessible and adaptable to
meet the changing needs of occupants, and to support independent living, the Council
will require that:
(a) all new residential development should meet the Building Regulations
Requirement M4(2): Category 2 – Accessible and Adaptable Dwellings; and
(b) on sites proposing 11 or more gross additional dwellings, a proportion of
dwellings will be expected to meet the Building Regulations Requirement M4(3):
Category 3 – Wheelchair User Dwellings, where appropriate.
II. Only where circumstances exist where it can be demonstrated by the applicant that
it is not practically achievable or financially viable to deliver this policy, will new
development be exempt from the requirement.14 . Housing

14.10.1 In addition to meeting the needs of the settled population, national policy requires
that local planning authorities make provision for Gypsies and Travellers and
Travelling Showpeople within their local plans, by setting respective pitch and plot
targets to meet likely permanent and transit site accommodation needs in their
area.

Showpeople is set out in 'Planning policy for traveller sites' DCLG, August 2015. This
can be viewed and downloaded from the Government's publications website at:

A definition of Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling Showpeople for planning policy
purposes is contained in Annex 1 of this document.
14.10.2 Criteria based policies are also required to both guide land supply allocations and
provide a basis for determining planning applications.
14.10.3 There are currently four authorised private Gypsy and Traveller sites in EastHerts:
Nine Acres, High Cross: 13 permitted pitches;
Field Farm, Levens Green: 6 permitted pitches;

Assessment Update, May 2016, identified that 5 permanent pitches for Gypsies
and Travellers and 9 plots for Travelling Showpeople should be provided in the
district for the period up to 2033.
14.10.6 For Gypsies and Travellers, 2 pitches will be required up to 2022, with a further 3
pitches between 2022-2027. These pitch requirements arise from two sites at:14 . Housing

14.12ExtensionsandAlterationstoDwellingsandResidentialOutbuildings
14.12.1 A large number of the planning applications received by the Council relate to
extensions to dwellings. In an area as large and diverse as East Hertfordshire, it is
not possible to provide precise standards relevant to every case, but the policies
below set out the principles and criteria by which proposals will be judged.
14.12.2 TheCouncilwillexpectallproposalsforextensionsandalterationstodwellingsand

14.12.3 Within the Green Belt and Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt, the Council is
concerned about the specific effect extensions and outbuildings may have on the
character and appearance of an existing dwelling, the site and surrounding area.

cumulative impact of development in the countryside.
Policy HOU11 Extensions and Alterations to Dwellings, Residential Outbuildings

Proposals for:

residential outbuildings or extensions to existing outbuildings; and
works within residential curtilages,
will be considered against the following criteria:
(a)beofasize,scale,mass,form,siting,designandmaterialsofconstructionthat
are appropriate to the character, appearance and setting of the existing dwelling
and/or the surrounding area, and extensions should generally appear as a
subservient addition to the dwelling;
(b) side extensions at first floor level or above should ensure appropriate space is
left between the flank wall of the extension and the common curtilage with a
neighbouring property (as a general rule a space of 1 metre will be the minimum
acceptable), to safeguard the character and appearance of the street scene and
prevent a visually damaging ‘terracing’ effect;
(c) flat roofed extensions, except those on the ground floor, will be refused as
visually undesirable other than in those exceptional circumstances where the
character of the original dwelling allows a flat-roofed design to be appropriately
incorporated, or it represents a sustainable or innovative design approach;
(d) roof dormers may be acceptable if appropriate to the design and character of
the dwelling and its surroundings. Dormers should generally be of limited extent
and modest proportions, so as not to dominate the existing roof form.14 . Housing

extend properties or for outbuildings to be used as a self-contained annexe to
accommodateelderlyrelatives,olderchildrenorstaff. Annexesforelderlyrelatives

of accommodation. However, they can have implications for car parking provision,

new proposals for a separate dwelling. In an urban setting there would be no
in-principle objection to a new dwelling, subject to design and amenity issues.

Economic Development
15 Economic Development
15.1 Introduction
15.1.1 East Herts is a district of fairly small towns and an extensive rural area. It lies
between the A1(M) and the M11, with only the A10 running north-south and the
A414 running east-west through the south of the district. East Herts is surrounded
by the larger centres of Hatfield, Welwyn Garden City, Stevenage, Letchworth and
Baldock,locatedalongtheA1(M)corridor.Tothesouthandeasttherearetheurban
areas of Hoddesdon, Cheshunt and Harlow. Stansted Airport, a major centre of
employment, lies just outside the district boundary to the north east of Bishop’s
Stortford.
15.1.2 This geography has a significant bearing on patterns of economic development.
East Herts is not a self-contained economy and in economic terms it plays a
supporting role in relation to the adjacent urban centres and Stansted Airport,
particularly in terms of labour supply. It is home to many of the people who work in
these adjacent towns (and the airport). As such, East Herts is part of a wider
integratedlabourandpropertymarketareacoveringmuchofHertfordshireandpart
of Essex and north London. East Herts is an important part of this economic
sub-region, but the district’s business base is made up predominantly of small and
medium sized firms, many of which will have links to companies in the sub-region,
to London or with Stansted Airport.
15.1.3 It is necessary to acknowledge the role East Herts plays and to balance the desire
toremaincompetitiveandtoprovidenewemploymentopportunitiesfortheresidents
of the district within the limitations created by the physical constraints of each town
and the wider economic geography.
15.1.4 East Herts is a prosperous district with higher than average earnings and relatively
low unemployment, though the statistics disguise pockets of relative deprivation
within the district. Educational attainment is generally very high, but there is a
disparitybetweenthewagesofthosewholiveandworkwithinthedistrictandthose
who live in East Herts but are employed outside the district in locations such as
London and Cambridge. There is therefore a need to ensure there is a balance of
employment opportunities available to residents and to ensure that the skills of the
workforce(bothschoolleaversandadultsalike)areappropriateforthebusinesses
within and beyond the district, and to provide support for entrepreneurialism, new
and growing businesses.
15.1.5 Retailandleisurefacilities,alongwitheducationandhealthcareservicesalsoprovide
valuable sources of employment. Businesses located in or with good connections
to a town centre for example can help to support these uses and can benefit from
shared resources and good public transport connectivity. It is therefore important
to encourage the retention of employment uses within towns and villages.15 . Economic Development

(England)Order2015.TheOrderisintendedtoincreasehousingsupplybyallowing
change of use from some business uses to residential.
15.1.7 Not all changes of use will be permitted development. Some will be subject to a
prior approval process which means that a developer has to seek approval from
the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are
acceptablebeforeworkcanproceed.Themattersforpriorapprovalvarydepending
on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in
Schedule 2 to the Order.
15.1.8 There are also a range of exclusions which apply to permitted development rights.
For instance, there are protected areas which include, for example, Conservation
Areas. Some permitted development rights are also in place for a limited period of
time; again, these are set out in full in the relevant sections in Schedule 2 to the
Order.
Permitted development rights are set out in The Town and Country Planning (General
Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 at: www.legislation.gov .uk
15.1.9 Whilst acknowledging permitted development rights, the District Plan must also
considerthelongertermneedsofthedistrict’seconomy.Businesseshaveperformed
well in East Herts despite the economic recession and the Council therefore
maintains that commercial and business units should be retained in appropriate
locations in order to provide suitable accommodation for existing and emerging
businesses and to facilitate sharing of services and supply chains. It is necessary
to ensure that where office space is converted into residential units this does not
result in isolated and unsustainable residential developments or prejudice the
prospects of remaining neighbouring businesses.
15.1.10 The NPPF requires local authorities to do all they can to support sustainable
economic growth and to plan proactively to meet the development needs of
businesses. Policies should be flexible enough to accommodate needs not
anticipated in the plan and to allow a rapid response to changes in economic
circumstances.Authoritiesshouldidentifypriorityareasforeconomicregeneration,
infrastructure provision and environmental enhancement, and facilitate flexible

15.2 Employment
15.2.1 TheNPPFisclearthatpoliciesshouldavoidthelongtermprotectionofemployment
land where there is no reasonable prospect of a site being used for that purpose.
The Council has produced a series of reports which identify the need to retain all
designated Employment Areas for current and future requirements. Nevertheless,
the policy approach is sufficiently flexible to respond to individual business needs
within the remit of protecting and retaining land for employment purposes.
The Council's technical studies relating to employment and economic development can
be viewed and downloaded from the Council's Website at:
www.eastherts.gov .uk/evidencebase
15.2.2 While a large proportion of the district’s employment generating uses and B-Class
businesses are located in designated Employment Areas, there are many small,
independenttradersandbusinesseslocatedacrossthedistricteitherinsmallclusters
or isolated units. These businesses are well located for the service they deliver15 . Economic Development
206
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
whilst providing valuable sources of local employment in a variety of businesses.
Therefore the Council seeks, in general, to retain and encourage their continued
use and if necessary, their replacement with alternative appropriate uses. On
designated Employment Areas, evidence of marketing for a minimum period of
twelvemonthswillberequired.Fornon-designatedsites,normallyaminimumperiod
of six months is requested, though each case will be determined on its merits in
discussion with the Development Management Team.
15.2.3 Evidence also shows that a significant proportion of employment generating uses
are actually in the retail and service industries and would not necessarily locate in
employment areas. In addition, there is a growing trend towards self-employment
and more flexible working patterns including working from home. To facilitate this
flexible approach to working, it is important that access to high-speed broadband
technologyisavailablealongwiththeabilitytoaccessofficespacewherenecessary.
Part of the district’s business offer could be through the provision of business-hub
facilitieswhichprovidemeetingrooms,officeequipmentandfunctionroomservices

met:
(a) The retention of the site or premises for Use Classes B1, B2 and B8 has been
fully explored without success. This should also consider whether improvements
to the existing site/premises would make it more attractive to alternative B1, B2 or
B8 uses. The applicant will be expected to undertake discussions with officers as
to the potential for and suitability of alternative uses. Evidence of a period of

(b) The retention of the B1, B2 or B8 use is unable to be facilitated by the partial

than400agriculturalholdingsoccupyingmorethan34,000hectares.Manyofthese

thereby supporting rural jobs and skills.
15.3.2 Employment areas within the rural area have a key role to play in providing
accessible and affordable employment and business opportunities. It is important
to balance the need to retain these vital rural employment locations with the need
toprotecttheamenityofthelocality.ChangestoPermittedDevelopmentlegislation
affecting buildings in the rural area have the potential to significantly affect rural
districts like East Herts. However, some Permitted Development changes are
temporary and are subject to change. It is therefore vital that the Council takes a
long term approach and seeks a high standard of development that is appropriate
to its setting.15 . Economic Development
208
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
15.3.3 Hertfordshire has a rich tradition of providing food for London and food production
is a key element of the rural economy. Local food production not only reduces food

foodsecurityandlocalemployment.Newtechnologyincreasesproductivity,efficiency

important that this area of agricultural heritage is protected and enhanced where
appropriate. The Council is supportive of initiatives which support food production
industries where they are in line with other District Plan policies.
15.3.4 Agricultural buildings within the rural area are often of historic merit and the
conversionofsuchbuildingsshouldbeundertakenwithcareinordertoprotectthe
historic and visual quality of the building and its setting. In most cases, agricultural
buildings would be considered in relation to the farm house, most of which, if they
are of historic merit would already be designated in some way. Where there is no
designation, an assessment will be made in relation to the Heritage policies in
Chapter 21 and other policies in this Plan. The Council will expect such proposals
totakeintoaccountHistoricEngland'sBestPracticeGuidelinesforAdaptiveReuse.

smartphonesandWi-Ficonnectivity,workingbehaviourischangingwithindividuals
and businesses working in more flexible ways. Recent trends indicate a growing
popularity of and propensity for flexible working patterns and working from home.
It is important that new residential properties are designed in a way that enables
households to work from home either occasionally or on a full-time basis. It is vital
that communications infrastructure is provided as a fully integrated part of new
residential and commercial premises, particularly in more rural locations.

(c) there will be no significant adverse impact on the amenity of the adjoining area
or nearby occupiers.
III. Where permission for live/work units is granted, the residential occupancy will be
restricted by condition to ensure that it is occupied by a person or persons employed in
the business carried out in the premises. The following conditions shall also be applied:
(a) The business floorspace of the live/work unit shall be finished ready for
occupation before the residential floorspace is occupied and the residential use
shall not precede commencement of the business use;
(b) The business floorspace of the live/work unit shall not be used for any purpose
other than for purposes within Class [B1]in the Schedule to the Town and Country
Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, or in any provision equivalent to that Class in
any statutory instrument revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without
modification;
15.5 Tourism
15.5.1 The tourism industry and visitors to the district play a vital role in the East Herts
economy, creating jobs and contributing to the maintenance of facilities. Tourism
in East Herts is a by-product of the high quality environment of its countryside and
historicmarkettowns,alongwithitslocationaladvantagesandproximitytoStansted
Airport, rather than something that can be effectively planned for. It is therefore
important that the provision of facilities which cater for the needs of visitors do not
detract or harm the very environment that attracts them.

15.6 Lifelong Learning
15.6.1 It is vital that the educational needs of the district are met both at primary and
secondary level, but also within higher education and adult learning opportunities,
includingapprenticeships.TheUniversityofHertfordshire’smaincampusislocated
in the nearby town of Hatfield. The University also has a campus based at
Bayfordbury, near Hertford, which specialises in ecological and astronomical
research.ItishometotheBayfordburyObservatoryandhostsanextensiveoutreach
programme for the general public and local schools, hosting regular public open
evenings. The campus participates in internationally important research and is a
significant contributor to the local economy.
15.6.2 Harlow College offers vocational courses and the Hertford Regional College has
campuses both within Ware and the neighbouring town of Turnford in Broxbourne
Borough, specialising in vocational courses. There are also active adult learning
partnershipsbetweensecondaryschoolswhichofferschool-leaverandadultlearning
opportunities. The Council’s Economic Development Vision seeks to engage with
these educational facilities, to support the development of further education
opportunities and to foster entrepreneurialism and the development and growth of
new businesses within the district.

15.6.3 In order to provide opportunities for those leaving education, and to support the
creation of new businesses and entrepreneurialism in general, the Council will
support in principle the creation of incubation units; small, flexible units designed
for start-up and growing businesses as part of new employment space across the
district.
Policy ED6 Lifelong Learning
The provision of new educational establishments which support a range of learning and
community needs such as further education and opportunities for lifelong learning will

Retail and Town Centres
16 Retail and Town Centres
16.1 Introduction
16.1.1 East Herts’ town centres play a vital role in providing for the every-day needs of
residents, providing not only a varied retail offer, but also for banking and
administrative needs, leisure and social opportunities. The market towns of East
Hertshavearichheritagewhichhasinfluencedtheircurrentformandlimitingroad
networks, character and architectural interest. However, this historic character can
also act as a constraint, prohibiting larger retailers from investing.
16.1.2 In recent years there have been many financial pressures on town centres, with
competition from larger centres including from out of town shopping centres, rising
proportions of internet shopping, rising business rates and rents, restricted bank
lending and a challenging economic climate. Despite this, East Herts’ towns have
been reasonably resilient suffering comparatively few closures.
16.2 Permitted Development Rights
16.2.1 Permitted development rights are a national grant of planning permission which
allow certain building works and changes of use to be carried out without having to
makeaplanningapplication.Permitteddevelopmentrightsaresubjecttoconditions
and limitations to control impact and to protect local amenity.
16.2.2 PermitteddevelopmentrightsaresetoutinTheTownandCountryPlanning(General
Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. The Order allows change of use
betweenshopsandfinancialandprofessionalservices,allowingthechangeofsuch
uses to restaurants or leisure use. The Order is also intended to increase housing
supply by allowing change of use from some business uses to residential.
16.2.3 Not all changes of use will be permitted development. Some will be subject to a
prior approval process which means that a developer has to seek approval from
the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are
acceptablebeforeworkcanproceed.Themattersforpriorapprovalvarydepending
on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in
Schedule 2 to the Order.
16.2.4 There are also a range of exclusions which apply to permitted development rights
such as within Conservation Areas. Some permitted development rights are also
in place for a limited period of time; again, these are set out in full in the relevant
sections in Schedule 2 to the Order.
Permitted development rights are set out in The Town and Country Planning (General
Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 at: www.legislation.gov .uk16 . Retail and Town Centres

East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
16.2.5 Whilst acknowledging permitted development rights, the District Plan must also
considerthelongerterminterestsofthedistrict’shighstreets.Itisthereforeimportant
that the Council plans positively, to support town centres to generate local
employment,promotebeneficialcompetitionwithinandbetweentowncentres,and
create attractive, diverse places where people want to live, visit and work.
16.3 Retail Development
16.3.1 Inordertosecurethevitalityandviabilityofthedistrict’sretailcentres,itisimportant
for planning policy to seek to retain a high proportion of units for retail uses, but to
also acknowledge the changing role town centres have in providing social and
cultural experiences, both now and in the future. A mixture of uses in the right
locationscanencourageactivitythroughoutthedayandintotheevening,providing
forsocialaswellasretailneeds,thusenhancingtheroleoftowncentres.Therefore,
where planning permission is required, the Council will seek to retain a high
proportion of shop uses in the town centre.
16.3.2 The following hierarchy of town centres will apply:
1. Principal Town Centre: Bishop’s Stortford
2. Secondary Town Centre: Hertford
3. Minor Town Centres: Buntingford, Sawbridgeworth and Ware
16.3.3 In accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), the Council
willapplyasequentialtesttoapplicationsformaintowncentreuses.Themaintown

16.3.4 TheNPPFstatesthatwhereaproposalisoveraproportionate,locallysetfloorspace
threshold, local planning authorities should require an impact assessment to be
submitted. The Retail and Town Centres Study (2013) indicated that it is not
considered appropriate to apply the default threshold of 2,500m² gross across the
district as this scale of development would represent a significant proportion of the
overall retail projections for East Herts through the Plan period. Given the high
proportion of small retail units and businesses in the district’s town centres,
developments over 500m² gross will be of a greater significance and therefore
should be subject to some form of impact assessment.

accommodation, has its own access, has arrangements for car parking and/or
access to, and availability of passenger transport, and has suitable refuse storage
facilities. The conversion of dwellings into commercial uses outside town centre
locations will be resisted.
Policy RTC1 Retail Development
I. Within the town centre boundaries as defined on the Policies Map, main town centre
uses as defined by the NPPF will be supported in principle, where they contribute to
maintaining the role and function, viability and vitality of the market town.
II. Proposals will be assessed in line with the sequential approach.
III. Proposals for retail outside the Primary Shopping Area, and for leisure, office and
other developments outside of town centres, which are not in accordance with policies
oftheDistrictPlan,willberequiredtoprovideanimpactassessmentindicatingtheimpact
of the proposal on existing, committed and planned public and private investment in the
town centre or in the catchment area of the proposal. The assessment should also
consider the impact of the proposal on town centre vitality and viability, including local
consumer choice and trade in the town centre and the wider area. The impact should
be measured for up to five years from the time the application is made. For major
schemes, the impact should be measured for up to ten years from the application. The
following thresholds will be applied:
Over 1,500 sq.m gross within the settlement boundary of Bishop’s Stortford
Over 1,000 sq.m gross within the settlement boundary of Hertford
Over 500 sq.m gross elsewhere
IV. Where a proposal fails to satisfy the sequential approach or is likely to have an
adverse impact in line with Part III above, it will be refused.
16.4 Primary Shopping Area
16.4.1 PrimaryShoppingAreasarewhereretailactivityisconcentrated,oftenunderpinned
by larger anchor stores and popular chains. Primary Shopping Areas contain both
primary and secondary frontages. Primary Shopping Frontages are normally the
retail 'core' of a centre where the majority of footfall and activity occurs. They are
likely to include a high proportion of retail uses which may include food, drinks,
clothing and household goods. Secondary Shopping Frontages provide a greater
diversity of uses such as restaurants, commercial services and leisure facilities,
which provide a supporting role for the centre as a whole.16 . Retail and Town Centres

16.4.3 ForconsistencywiththePermittedDevelopmentOrder2015,‘keyshoppingareas’
are those designated as Primary Shopping Areas in this Plan. Change of Use
proposalsfromA1(Shop)orA2(FinancialandProfessionalServices)tootheruses
will be expected to demonstrate that there is no reasonable prospect of the unit
being put to A1 or A2 use and that following the change of use there will be an
adequate provision of A1 or A2 uses to maintain the sustainability (viability and
vitality) of the Primary Shopping Area.
16.4.4 The historic environment and market town heritage of East Herts’ town centres are
akeyattractiontobothretailersandvisitors. Alterationstoshopfrontsareexpected
to be of the highest quality, reflecting the local character and vernacular in

within which retail and other main town centre uses, as defined in the NPPF, should be

II. The Primary Shopping Areas will contain both Primary and Secondary Shopping
Frontages. Proposals for development within Primary Shopping Frontages will be
considered in accordance with Policy RTC3 (Primary Shopping Frontages). Proposals
fordevelopmentwithinSecondaryShoppingFrontageswillbeconsideredinaccordance
with Policy RTC4 (Secondary Shopping Frontages).16 . Retail and Town Centres
219East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
16.5 Primary Shopping Frontages
16.5.1 Whilst acknowledging permitted development opportunities, it is not appropriate to
take a relaxed approach to development within East Herts' town centres, nor is it
appropriate to prevent changes of use from A1 (Shop) uses to other uses, as to do
so could prevent diversity and stifle investment, resulting in vacant uses. However,
it is appropriate to seek to maintain a high proportion of A1 (Shop) uses in order to
ensure the vitality and viability of the town centres, so that they are able to perform
their function as retail and leisure destinations, and to distinguish between the
primary and secondary frontages. For the purpose of this policy and for the
application of the Prior Approval process, an adequate provision of A1 and A2 is
defined as at least 50% of units in a single frontage being in A1 and A2 uses. A
single frontage is normally described as an unbroken row of shops, usually within
two side roads and is shown on the Policies Map.
Policy RTC3 Primary Shopping Frontages
In order to protect the vitality and viability of the Primary Shopping Areas, within the
PrimaryShoppingFrontagesinBishop’sStortford,HertfordandWare,asdefinedonthe
Policies Map, proposals for Use Class A1 will be supported in principle as the preferred
use, while Use Classes A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 will be supported in principle provided
they have an active frontage and there remains an adequate provision of A1 and A2
uses which support its role as a Primary Shopping Frontage.
16.6 Secondary Shopping Frontages
16.6.1 Within the Primary Shopping Areas of Bishop’s Stortford, Hertford and Ware,
Secondary Shopping Frontages provide an opportunity for the types of uses that
support a town centre’s function as a destination for leisure as well as for retail
purposes, such as restaurants, coffee shops, financial and commercial services.
16.6.2 TheTownCentresofBuntingfordandSawbridgeworthareminortowncentreswith
a high number of independent stores and a low number of national retailers. Given
theirroleasservicecentresfortheirimmediatepopulationandruralhinterland,the
town centre boundary is tightly drawn around the existing high street and there is
no primary shopping area designated. There are no obvious areas within these
towncentreswherethereisapredominanceofClassA1(Shop)uses.Itistherefore
appropriate to define the frontages within the two towns as Secondary Shopping16 . Retail and Town Centres

Frontages, where a flexible approach to changes of use will be applied where this
doesnotleadtoadisproportionateandpotentiallydetrimentalnumberofnon-retail

Policy RTC4 Secondary Shopping Frontages
Within the Secondary Shopping Frontages in Bishop’s Stortford, Buntingford, Hertford,
Sawbridgeworth and Ware, as defined on the Policies Map, proposals for development
or changes of use to main town centre uses or those that will support the vitality and
viability of the frontage or town centre as a whole (such as employment generating or
activity generating uses) will be supported in principle.
16.7 Markets and Specialist Events
16.7.1 Markets, Farmers Markets and specialist events are an important feature of town
centres, promoting the identity of the town, while increasing visitor numbers which
creates additional trade for other town centre premises on market day. Specialist
marketsalsodrawinvisitorsfromfurtherafieldandarekeysellingopportunitiesfor
local farms, smallholders and the crafting community.
16.7.2 The Council’s Economic Development Vision for East Herts seeks to maintain and
enhance markets and specialist events in town centres, and the Council will work

centre environment to support market and specialist events will be encouraged.
16.8DistrictCentres,NeighbourhoodCentres,LocalParadesandIndividual
Shops
16.8.1 District centres, neighbourhood centres and local parades support the day-to-day
needs of communities, providing opportunities for top-up shopping and access to
services and social interactions. Quite often they are essential for those less able
to travel to town centres or larger retail centres. It is therefore important that these
local centres provide the type and range of retail and commercial uses necessary
to serve and support the local community.
16.8.2 Districtcentresgenerallycompriseagroupofshops,separatefromthetowncentre,
with at least one supermarket or superstore, together with a range of non-retail
services and public facilities. In order to reflect the important role played by the
ThorleyCentreinBishop'sStortfordintermsofthelocalprovisionoffoodshopping

16.8.3 The Bishop's Park Centre in Bishop's Stortford is similar to the Thorley Centre, in
thatitprovidesalocaldestinationforfoodshoppingandservices.However,despite
the supermarket being slightly larger, the centre contains only one other retail unit16 . Retail and Town Centres

17.1 Introduction
17.1.1 The importance of good design in securing high quality development is widely
recognised. Design is not just about visual appearance and function: it is about a
wholerangeofsocial,economicandenvironmentalconsiderations,whichtogether
are a major contributor to quality of life.
17.1.2 One of the objectives of this Plan is to raise the standards and quality of the layout
and design of new development. The District Council is strongly committed to
promoting good design in new developments and to improving the quality of public
spaces.Gooddesignisakeyaspectofsustainabledevelopmentandcancontribute

that communities value, but also to ensuring that the use of resources and the
environmental impact of new development is reduced.
17.1.3 Good design can encourage healthy lifestyles by encouraging movement on foot
and by bicycle. It can also enhance local distinctiveness, promote the vitality of the
localeconomy,facilitatecommunitycohesionbyenablingsocialinteractioninsecure
public spaces and incorporate multi-functional Green Infrastructure networks. In
summary, good design can contribute towards creating attractive and safe places
where people want to live, work, and visit.
17.2 Design Objectives
17.2.1 To achieve high quality design, there are several intrinsic sustainable development
objectives that should be understood by applicants to inform the design of new
development. These are to:
1. Respect, improve and enhance the existing surrounding environment;
2. Respond to existing patterns of development and the local context;
3. Be attractive in appearance but receptive to original design and innovation in
construction techniques, design and technologies;
4. Be usable, in terms of accessibility, legibility and be well-connected;
5. Be adaptable and flexible to the needs of the occupiers now and in the future;
6.Besociallyinclusive,cateringforthecurrentandchangingneedsofthedistrict’s

7. Discourage crime and anti-social behaviour;
8. Encourage good health and well-being;17 . Design and Landscape

2. New dwellings
3. Multi-residential (e.g. care homes)
4. Education & Health
5. Commercial & Industrial
6. Large & Mixed-use
17.3.3 The Toolkit has been created to help those who prepare and assess development
proposalsinHertfordshiretobetterunderstandtheprinciplesofsustainabledesign
and consider how best they can be applied to a specific scheme and site. Using a
virtual townscape, the Toolkit aims to provoke thought and inform decisions on the
design and build of new development schemes in Hertfordshire. It does this by
providing a simple framework of questions, best practice guidance and further
information on sustainable design.
17.3.4 Users of the Toolkit can choose from any of the six development types to navigate
a wealth of sustainable design guidance on issues such as climate change, water,
materials and safety.17 . Design and Landscape

17.3.5 TheGovernmentconductedaHousingStandardsreviewin2015,whichintegrated
some voluntary standards into Building Regulations and created a suite of optional
national housing standards that planning authorities can choose to include in local
plans. Building Regulations change over time, while sustainable design and
technology improves and becomes more viable as they become more established.
East Herts Council aspires for all development to exceed national standards and
Building Regulations where possible and developments will be expected to utilise
the best available sustainable design and technology as possible.
17.3.6 The Building Research Establishment has established a new Home Quality Mark
to replace the Code for Sustainable Homes which was revoked in the National
Standards Review 2015. The Home Quality Mark is an independent assessment
of the home’s quality in terms of its contribution to the occupant’s health and
wellbeing, cost to maintain and energy efficiency for example. It is a voluntary
standard which demonstrates that design and construction exceeds that required
by Building Regulations and can be used as a tool when marketing and buying
properties and may be used as a benchmark for proposals.
The Home Quality Mark guidance can be viewed at:

17.4 Planning Applications

DistrictCouncilexpectsahighstandardofdesigninnewdevelopmentandassuch
will require that all ‘significant’ applications undertake a Masterplanning process.
The significance of a development will be measured not only on its scale, but on
the potential impact on the community and local character of the place into which
it is to be introduced, and the ability to bring forward benefits to the community.
Generally, a threshold of fifty homes or more will apply. However, in some cases,

17.5 Design Codes
17.5.1 A Design Code is a set of specific rules or requirements to guide the physical
development of a site or place. The aim of design coding is to provide clarity as to
what constitutes acceptable design quality and thereby a level of certainty for
developers and the local community alike that can help to accelerate the delivery
of good quality new development.17 . Design and Landscape

the wider locality. For example, development in proximity to water spaces should
respond to and incorporate the water space in the design to add to the character
of development. Therefore successful development should respond to locally
distinctivepatternsofdevelopment,buildingmethodsanddetailing,landscapeand
history.

building forms, patterns of development and the natural environment, the scale of
new development should:17 . Design and Landscape

1. Avoid obscuring important views, vistas and skylines as established through a
Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment;
2. Ensure the height and massing does not interrupt the rhythm of an existing
building/roof line and overall streetscape, or detract from the local and wider
area's character;
3. Respect the existing scale in the detailing and composition of elements such
as windows, doors etc; and
4. Have regard for the principal users of development schemes so that buildings
and infrastructure are scaled for their maximum benefit and enhance their
experience of the space.

17.7.4 Taller buildings are often more suited to key locations such as on corners, along
principal routes, the end of vistas or around parks.
17.7.5 The layout, form, building details and massing of a development will have a great
impact on a locality, and the opportunity to enhance, add variety and local
distinctiveness. Layouts should observe good urban design principles, with a clear
sense of public and private frontages and buildings, positively addressing public
routes within and around a site. The layout and alignment of built form, plots and

17.7.15 The Council welcomes landscape design which incorporates principles of green
space infrastructure as well as sustainability such as use of local materials, low
energy consumption for construction and maintenance, local recycling of water
through surfaces which increase the permeability of the ground (such as SUDS or
multifunctional green space), good pedestrian/cycle links and facilities to reduce
car use.
Policy DES3 Landscaping
I. Development proposals must demonstrate how they will retain, protect and enhance
existing landscape features which are of amenity and/or biodiversity value, in order to
ensure that there is no net loss of such features.
II. Where losses are unavoidable and justified by other material considerations,
compensatory planting or habitat creation will be sought either within or outside the

234
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
17.7.17 Such large scale proposals should be designed using a comprehensive master
planning approach to the whole site within its immediate and wider context, rather
than following landownership parcels.
17.7.18 It is also important that layouts are configured in such a way that they are easy to
understand,arevibrant,well-connected,inclusive,feelsafe,andhaveclearlydefined
public and private spaces. While the Government’s previous guidance ‘By Design:
UrbanDesigninthePlanningSystem’waswithdrawninMarch2014,theprinciples
within the guidance are still relevant and provide a good framework for creating
attractive and sustainable developments.
Public Realm and Inclusive Design
17.7.19 Public realm refers to all publicly accessible open spaces and public and civic
building facilities, publicly owned streets, pathways, water spaces, rights of way
and parks. For places to work and foster sustainable communities it is important
that the public realm is of a high quality, feels safe, is inclusive to all social groups,
andisadaptabletothechangingneedsofthecommunity.Thisisachievablethrough:
1. Careful design that prioritises and promotes walking;
2. Design that encourages cycling, including through the provision of safe and
secure cycle storage;
3. The quality and materials of the hard landscaping (paving, kerbs, walls etc);
4. Unclutteredandsimplifiedstreetfurniture,whichincludestheprovisionofclear
and legible signage where necessary, electric vehicle charging points and
recycling facilities;
5. Planting (trees, grassed areas, flowers, formal, semi-formal and informal
planting);
6. Green space being retained, enhanced and integrated into the design of a
development scheme, which may include the creation of space for local food
production, community gardens or orchards. This can help to reinforce the

take the opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area
and the way it functions.
Small-scale Developments
17.7.24 Many developments that occur are of a small scale, often extensions to existing
properties or the replacement of single dwellings. It is important that the character
of the locality and the potential amenity impacts of these smaller developments
respect the local character and do not significantly detract from the amenities of
any neighbouring property by shadowing, loss of privacy, or similar.

the cumulative effect of signs and notices that is likely to cause the greatest visual
impact and detrimental effect.
17.9.4 In the rural area, many signs or advertisements could appear incongruous. It is
acknowledged that commercial concerns in rural areas experience difficulty in

18.1.5 While the primary responsibility for the delivery of transport provision in the district
lies with Hertfordshire County Council as Highway Authority, East Herts Council
has involvement in some aspects, mainly via the planning system, community
transport, and the management and enforcement of parking.18 . Transport
242
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
18.1.6 New development can aid the improvement of the transport offer in the district by
making the best use of existing infrastructure (including passenger transport),
providing new components where necessary, and also by contributing to the
improvement of passenger transport provision, walking and cycling. In enabling
access to new development, the provision of safe sustainable travel alternatives

18.1.7 Priority should focus on locating new residential development in close proximity to
employment, retail, educational and leisure facilities and services, where good
passenger transport exists, or where infrastructure and service provision can be
improved. This approach can aid the local economy by supporting local services
and facilities. Concentrating development in sustainable locations can also help
benefit the wider economy via a reduction in congestion caused by additional
generated trips over those occasioned by a more widely disbursed development
pattern.

parts of the district the dispersed settlement pattern with related lower levels of
passenger transport provision and attendant high levels of car dependency make

while supporting and encouraging a reduction in car usage, it is necessary to
recognise the importance of private motorised transport in enabling the population
of more rural locations to access key facilities and services.
18.1.9 Likewise, it should also be acknowledged that, in order to help mitigate the impact
of development, the delivery of additional key road-based infrastructure measures
may be necessary in certain situations to enable strategic growth in the district to
occur. Key infrastructure requirements to enable delivery of the Plan are set out in
Chapter 3, The Development Strategy.18 . Transport

18.2 Sustainable Transport
18.2.1 TheDistrictCouncil,inrecognisingthattheachievementofsustainabledevelopment
underpins national planning policy, seeks to promote sustainable transport and
improve accessibility as an important part of its District Plan policy approach. Key
issues to be addressed include:
1. Minimising the need to travel;
2. Increasing choice and availability of sustainable transport options;
3. Prioritising sustainable travel modes in new developments;
4. Increasing connectivity and integration of sustainable transport modes;
5. Encouraging healthy communities by supporting walking and cycling;
6. Reducing congestion and carbon-dioxide emissions to improve air quality and
health benefits for the District's residents and visitors (see also Policy EQ4 Air
Quality).
18.2.2 Therefore, strong emphasis will be placed on seeking the provision of new bus,
cycle and pedestrian transport routes and networks in addition to extending and
strengthening existing provision, including through supporting community-led
transport schemes.
18.2.3 Itis,however,acknowledgedbytheGovernment,intheNPPF,that“differentpolicies

new development is sited away from urban areas it is recognised that there may

provision in some locations. However, every effort should be made to ensure that
the best possible sustainable transport outcomes can be achieved for all new
developments, irrespective of remoteness of location, and developers will be
expected to demonstrate where specific circumstances indicate otherwise.
Policy TRA1 Sustainable Transport
I. To achieve accessibility improvements and promotion of sustainable transport in the
district, development proposals should:
(a) Primarily be located in places which enable sustainable journeys to be made
to key services and facilities to help aid carbon emission reduction;
(b) Where relevant, take account of the provisions of the Local Transport Plan;18 . Transport

are both safe for users and suitable for the type of development and number of
users proposed and trips predicted to be generated. Where additional trips are
predicted from a site it is necessary to ensure that measures can commensurately
mitigate the impact where possible. While the NPPF is clear that “development
should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds where the residual
cumulativeimpactsofdevelopmentaresevere”(Paragraph32,NPPF,CLG,2012),18 . Transport
245East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
developers should be able to demonstrate that transport provision associated with
development proposals will be appropriate, both in terms of modal choice and the
capacity of the highway network to accommodate additional trips.
18.3.2 However,itisimportantthatproposedmitigationmeasuresshouldnotonlyachieve
their transport objective but also respect the character of the area and not have a
significantadverseeffectonthewiderenvironmentandtheamenityoflocalresidents,
e.g. through unacceptable trip generation levels, displacement parking, etc.
Policy TRA2 Safe and Suitable Highway Access Arrangements and Mitigation
Development proposals should ensure that safe and suitable access can be achieved
for all users. Site layouts, access proposals and any measures designed to mitigate trip
generation produced by the development should:
(a) Be acceptable in highway safety terms;
(b) Not result in any severe residual cumulative impact; and
(c)Nothaveasignificantdetrimentaleffectonthecharacterofthelocalenvironment.
18.4 Vehicle Parking Provision
18.4.1 Theamountofparkingprovisionassociatedwithdevelopmentcanhaveasignificant
effect on the mode of transport used to access it. The restriction of provision at
destination points can lead to greater use of sustainable transport from place of
origin instead of car usage.
18.4.2 Whilethebenefitsofsuchrestrictionsarerecognisedintermsofreducedcongestion,
vehicle emissions etc, it is also important to ensure that they do not lead to
displacement parking to other areas. Maintaining the vitality and viability of the
district’s market towns and service centres is also of key importance. Therefore, a
balance needs to be achieved between restricting parking provision in new
developments and ensuring that sufficient provision is made, while also ensuring
thatsuitableparkingfacilitiesforcyclesandpoweredtwo-wheelersareprovidedto
encourage modal shift to sustainable transport options.
18.4.3 The Council’s Supplementary Planning Document ‘Vehicle Parking Provision at
New Development, 2008’ sets out the amount of parking spaces that should be
provided in association with development and also offers guidance concerning the
design and layout of such provision. This approach is supplemented by revised
vehicle parking standards, which were agreed by the Council in July 2015.
Additionally, a revised Vehicle Parking Supplementary Planning Document is to be
prepared,toreplacethe2008versionandtherevisedstandardsof2015,whichwill

19.1 Introduction
19.1.1 In order for communities to be successful, it is vital that they are well served by a
full range of services and infrastructure which are appropriate to people’s needs
and accessible to all.
19.1.2 One of the Council’s priorities is to tackle health inequalities across the Districtand
to improve and promote the health and wellbeing of East Herts residents. Well

in a shortfall in the provision of facilities. Planning also has a role in promoting the
provision and enhancement of new and existing facilities through a positive policy
approachtowardssuchdevelopment,andwherenecessarythroughsiteallocation.
19.2.3 Sport England is the Government agency which seeks to encourage people and
communities to participate in active sport and recreation. It aims to ensure positive
planning for sport, enabling the right facilities to be provided in the right places,
based on robust and up-to-date assessments of need for all levels of sport and all
sectors of the community. Sport England, working with the provisions of the NPPF,
encourage local planning authorities to make direct reference to sport in local
planning policy to protect, enhance and provide sports facilities, as well as helping
to realise the wider benefits that participation in sport can bring. As such, Sport
England has a role in protecting sports provision and is consulted where planning

19.4 Public Rights of Way
19.4.1 Rights of Way are footpaths, bridleways and byways which have public access.
Hertfordshire has an extensive Rights of Way network of over 5,200 paths totalling
morethan3,000km.Thesepathsareshownonamapandhaveawrittendescription
in a legal record called the Definitive Map and Statement, which is looked after by
Hertfordshire County Council's Rights of Way Service at County Hall, Hertford.

www.hertfordshire.gov .uk/services/envplan/countrysideaccess/row/
19.4.2 The Public Rights of Way network has always been an asset for recreation or for
the purpose of everyday use such as getting to the local shop or to a bus stop for
example. This valuable resource, often taken for granted, now plays an even more
important role with regards to people’s health and wellbeing and can contribute
towards reducing carbon emissions by encouraging travel on foot or by bicycle
rather than by car. Public Rights of Way also help to boost tourism and therefore
contributetowardsthelocaleconomy.Withoutthemitwouldbedifficultforresidents
and visitors alike to access the countryside we have in and around East Herts.
19.4.3 Development proposals should therefore take full account of the need to protect
and enhance Public Rights of Way.

19.5 Water Based Recreation
19.5.1 The district’s many rivers, canals, lakes and other enclosed water areas such as
former quarries and gravel pits offer many opportunities for recreation such as
anglingandboatingaswellaswalkingandcycling.Contributingtothecharacterof
the towns through which they flow, notably Bishop’s Stortford, Hertford, Ware and
Sawbridgeworth,thesewaterwaysare also primary habitatsforvulnerable species
of flora and fauna and as such it is necessary to ensure that recreational activities
do not harm the very habitats that make them attractive to visitors.19 . Community Facilities, Leisure and Recreation
254
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
19.5.2 Any proposals for development needed to support water based recreation which
might increase the recreational use of a stretch of waterway should be considered
in conjunction with the Canal & River Trust as Navigation Authority to ensure there
is no detrimental impact on other recreational users of the waterway or towpath.
Policy CFLR4 Water Based Recreation
Proposals for water-based recreation will be supported in principle, where:
(a) The proposal does not have a significant adverse impact on the nature
conservation interest, the character, or appearance of the environment;
(b)TheproposaltakesaccountoftherelevantRiverCatchmentManagementPlan;
and
(c) The proposal does not have an adverse impact on any flood alleviation works
and does not impede the Environment Agency’s access requirements to
watercourses.
19.6 The Lee Valley Regional Park

of a growing population.
19.6.2 TheRegionalParkisstatutorilydesignatedforleisure,recreation,sportandnature
conservation. It covers an area of 4,000 hectares and stretches for 26 miles along
the River Lea from the River Thames in East London to Ware in Hertfordshire.
Established by Parliament in 1967 the Regional Park was created to meet the
recreation, leisure and nature conservation needs of London, Hertfordshire and
Essex.
19.6.3 Approximately 440 hectares of the Park lie within East Herts, with 98.69% of it
designated as Green Belt. This is an area of predominantly high quality landscape
with a rural and unspoilt character and features of heritage significance. Gravel

the character of the countryside.
19.7.2 While equestrian development can be appropriate in the open countryside, the
cumulative impact of horse related activities and associated buildings can have an
adverse impact on the character and appearance of rural areas. Existing buildings
should, wherever possible, be re-used. New buildings for horse related activities,

19.8 Community Facilities
19.8.1 Community facilities provide for the health and wellbeing, social, educational,
recreational, leisure and cultural needs of the community. Community facilities
include, but are not limited to: art galleries; cinemas; community centres;
crèches/nurseries;healthcarefacilities;householdwasterecyclingcentres;museums
andlibraries;musicandconcerthalls;placesofworship;schools;postoffices;public
houses;villagehalls;local/villageshops.Suchfacilitiesactasthefocusofcommunity

providedbyawidevarietyofagenciesincludinglocalauthorities,otherpublicservice
providers,churchesandthevoluntaryandbusinesssectorsandcansometimesbe
provided on single multi-use sites.
19.8.2 Urban and rural communities require access to core community facilities. The
requirementforfacilitiesisevolvinginresponsetochangesintheneedsofthelocal
population. As the proportion of people over 65 increases, so demand for facilities
catering for older people will rise. New facilities and services including crematoria
and burial space may be needed, particularly where a significant amount of new
housing is proposed.
19.8.3 Planning can help co-ordinate the provision of new facilities and new housing
development, and obtain appropriate developer contributions. It can also resist the
loss of existing facilities. The District Council will require that proposals for change
of use are supported by evidence that the particular facility is no longer viable and
explain the options that have been investigated to maintain the service. As new
developments require good access to facilities and create additional demand for
existingfacilities,soanyshortfallinprovisionarisingasaresultofnewdevelopment,
must be addressed as part of the development.
19.8.4 Within villages and the rural area, community facilities are vital to residents, often
providing a lifeline for those unable to get into town on a regular basis. The loss of
local village shops, post-offices and pubs can be a substantial loss to the local
community.
19.8.5 Under the Localism Act, voluntary and community organisations can nominate an
asset to be included on a list of 'assets of community value'. This list is managed
by the Council. If a landowner wants to sell a registered property, they must tell the
Council. If a group wants to buy the asset, they can trigger a six month moratorium19 . Community Facilities, Leisure and Recreation
258
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
to give them a chance to raise the money but the landowner can still sell at the
going market rate. This period gives community groups some time to develop a
proposal and raise the required capital to bid for the property when it comes onto

19.9 Health and Wellbeing
19.9.1 The NPPF requires planners to consider health in a range of different ways. The
framework’s presumption in favour of sustainable development highlights the
importanceofachievingsocial,economicandenvironmentalobjectives(healthand
wellbeing encompasses all three). The Health and Social Care Act, which came
into force in April 2013, introduced a new public health landscape. Within
Hertfordshire,thepreviousNHSPrimaryCareTrustconfigurationhasbeenreshaped
into the Herts County Council Public Health Directorate working with District and
Borough Councils in a two-tier formation, along with other vital health partners,
statutory and voluntary, addressing local health need.
19.9.2 The Hertfordshire Health and Wellbeing Strategy (2013-2016) was developed at
this time with nine priorities and is to be refreshed in 2016. Hertfordshire County
Council also has its own Public Health Strategy (2013-2017). In addition, the East19 . Community Facilities, Leisure and Recreation
260
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
Herts Health and Wellbeing Strategy (2013) supports the life course approach to
health which looks at the people, places and communities they live in, seeking to
provide the best potential for improved health outcomes from birth to grave.
19.9.3 The following priority elements are foundation principles of the East Herts Health
and Wellbeing Strategy:
1. Healthy children starting off well;
2. Empowering children, young people and adults to achieve their life potential;
3. Creating health and work together;
4. Promoting positive health and wellbeing life quality for all;
5. Healthy places and sustainable communities;
6. Pro-active health prevention.

is applied. To ensure they are consistently quantified, applications must be
accompanied by a Biodiversity Impact Assessment using the locally approved
DEFRA Biodiversity Metric where appropriate.
20.2.11 It is important that a consistent, acceptable standard of supporting ecological
information is supplied with planning applications. In order to ensure this, it will be
expected that ecological information is presented in accordance with the British
Standard on Planning and Biodiversity – BS42020 2013 Biodiversity – Code of
practice for planning and development.

20.3.3 Whilst protecting priority species and habitats (as listed under Section 41 of the
Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006) is important, if biodiversity
is to be genuinely enhanced, the conservation of all wildlife and habitats needs to
beatthecentreofdevelopmentandplanningdecisionmaking.Itmustberecognised

contribute significantly to the biodiversity of an area. Indeed the vast majority of
biodiversity in this country is dependent on non-priority habitat. Through use of the

Website at: www.eastherts.gov .uk/evidencebase
20.4.3 East Herts has a rich green infrastructure resource centred on the principal river
valleys of the Lee, Mimram, Beane, Quin, Rib, Ash and Stort in addition to a varied
mosaic of landscape and habitat types, such as grassland, ancient and plantation
woodland and farmland of importance to wildlife. However, through time and
changing pressures on the use of land, these habitats have become fragmented
and disconnected. While these sites still contribute towards the district’s green
infrastructure, improvements are necessary in order to strengthen their quality,
connectednessandresiliencetochangingclimatesandtheimpactofhumanactivity,
and to provide opportunities for other green infrastructure functions.
20.4.4 Street trees, gardens, waterways, public parks and open spaces all contribute to
urban green infrastructure. Quite often such urban green infrastructure is the only
‘natural environment’ we connect with on a day-to-day basis. Yet these features

Heritage Assets
21 Heritage Assets
21.1 Introduction
21.1.1 The District is fortunate in having a rich and varied historic environment, which
includes landscapes, sites, monuments, buildings and townscapes, and buried
remains of significant archaeological and historic interest.
21.2 Heritage Assets
21.2.1 Heritage assets make a valuable contribution to the areas’ economic and social
wellbeing. Heritage assets include buildings, monuments, sites, places, areas or
landscapes positively identified as having special interest and significance that
merits consideration in planning decisions. Heritage assets are the valued
components of the historic environment. They include designated heritage assets
and non-designated assets identified by the local planning authority.
21.2.2 The District Council recognises that heritage assets are an irreplaceable resource
that should be conserved in a manner appropriate to their special interest and
significance. Heritage assets in East Herts include:
45 Scheduled Monuments
Nearly 3,100 Listed Buildings (which comprise over 4,000 individual listed
features)
42 Conservation Areas
550 Areas of Archaeological Significance
16 Registered Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest
58 Locally Listed Historic Parks and Gardens
21.2.3 Not all designated heritage assets are identified under the Planning Acts, for
example,scheduledmonumentsaredesignatedinseparatelegislation.Nonetheless,

Policy HA1 Designated Heritage Assets
I. Development proposals should preserve and where appropriate enhance the historic
environment of East Herts.
II. Development proposals that would lead to substantial harm to the significance of a
designated heritage asset will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that the

state of the heritage asset will not be taken into account in any decision.
IV. The Council will, as part of a positive strategy, pursue opportunities for the
conservation and enjoyment of the historic environment recognising its role and
contribution in achieving sustainable development.
21.2.5 In addition to those heritage assets that are statutorily protected, non-designated
assets can be identified by the Local Planning Authority if they are considered to
be of local significance. Significance refers to the value of a historic asset to this
and future generations because of its heritage interest. That interest may be
archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from
the heritage asset’s physical presence, but also its setting. Significance will be
measured in terms of how the asset meets the following five criteria:
Rarity
Representativeness
Aesthetic appeal
Integrity
Association

Policy HA3 Archaeology
I. Where a site has the potential to include heritage assets with archaeological interest
(whether scheduled or unscheduled), applicants should consult with the Hertfordshire

21.4.3 The Council’s Conservation Areas are identified on the Policies Map. In order to
protect their special interest, stricter controls over demolition, works to trees and

Conservation Area Character Appraisals also include Conservation Area
Management Proposals. Management Proposals are a statutory requirement of
s.71 of the 1990 Act.They will put forward policy and project initiatives designed to
address the threats and opportunities identified in the Character Appraisal and
thereby more effectively preserve and enhance the character and appearance of
the Conservation Area.
21.4.5 Evidence from Conservation Area Character Appraisals and local groups indicate
that a number of Conservation Areas are suffering from the gradual erosion of
traditional features, materials and details in both the public and private realm and
thatthisisunderminingtheirspecialinterest. Amoreproactiveapproachisneeded
to halt and reverse this trend and to reinstate these features as part of works to
preserve and enhance the character and appearance of Conservation Areas.
21.4.6 Where appropriate, Article 4 directions will be made that bring specific permitted
development rights within the planning system. This will be used to prevent the
further loss of significant historic features and to seek to secure the restoration of
featuresalready lost. Thus,in time,the erosion of the Conservation Area’s special
interest will be halted and reversed and the area will be better preserved and
enhanced.
Policy HA4 Conservation Areas
I. New development, extensions and alterations to existing buildings in Conservation
Areas will be permitted provided that they preserve or enhance the special interest,
character and appearance of the area. Development proposals outside a Conservation
Area which affect its setting will be considered likewise. Proposals will be expected to:
(a) Respect established building lines, layouts and patterns;21 . Heritage Assets

21.6 Historic Parks and Gardens
21.6.1 Historic parks and gardens are a fragile and finite resource: they can easily be
damaged beyond repair or lost forever. They are an important part of the heritage
and environment of the district. They comprise of a variety of features: the open
space;viewsinandout;theplanting;waterfeatures;builtfeaturesandarchaeological
remains. There is a need to protect such sites and their settings from new
development which would destroy or harm the historic interest.

it can include, for example, an extension acceptable in historic building terms, but
exceeding the maximum size permitted under plan policies for the rural area.

Change. Both modules include practical advice in relation to measures which can
help to address climate change.
Building Futures is an interactive website which can be accessed at:
www.hertfordshire.gov .uk/microsites/building-futures/building-futures.aspx
22.2 Adaptation
22.2.1 Climate change is expected to result in hazards such as heatwaves, flooding, and
drought. Adaptation means improving our resilience to such impacts. This section
addressestheissueofoverheating.Measuresrelateddirectlytowaterandclimate
change adaptation, including flood risk, water efficiency, and sustainable urban
drainage, are contained within Chapter 23: Water.
22.2.2 Measures to address overheating may be undertaken at building level,
neighbourhood scale, and town or urban extension scale. Examples of measures
include:
1. using site landform and landscape to benefit from shelter, to minimise heat
losses in winter, provide adequate shade in summer, and to catch breezes
2. using deciduous trees to maximise shade in summer and allow light in during
the winter, or structural or functional design to achieve a similar effect
3. minimising energy demand, for example using cross-ventilation, to avoid a
viciouscirclewherebyincreaseddemandforairconditioninggeneratesfurther
climate-changing emissions22 . Climate Change
290
East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
4. using materials that prevent the penetration of heat to a building, which can
include green roofs or walls, light coloured materials in exposed surfaces, and
forlargecarparks;roadenergysystemswhichstoreheatandreleaseitduring
the winter months
5. providing green infrastructure including woodlands, orchards, street trees and
green landscaping, parks, sports grounds, allotments, and green roofs.
22.2.3 Such measures may have a number of wider benefits, including reduced energy
billsandimprovingthequalityofthebuiltenvironment.TheBuildingFuturesClimate
Change Adaptation module contains further guidance on adaptation solutions.
Policy CC1 Climate Change Adaptation
All new development should:
(a) Demonstrate how the design, materials, construction and operation of the
development would minimise overheating in summer and reduce the need for
heating in winter; and
(b) Integrate green infrastructure from the beginning of the design process to
contributetourbangreening,includingthepublicrealm.Elementsthatcancontribute
tothisincludeappropriatetreeplanting,greenroofsandwalls,andsoftlandscaping.
22.3 Mitigation
22.3.1 Carbon emissions originate from a wide range of sources, including transport,
construction, and all forms of energy use including heating and appliances. The
Climate Change Act (2008) sets out a legally binding target for reducing the UK's
carbon dioxide emissions, in order to mitigate or reduce the impacts of climate
change. Planning plays a role in terms of locating development so as to minimise
the need to travel, which is addressed in the transport policies and also in the
development strategy for the district.
22.3.2 There are four main types of approach to reduction of carbon emissions from
development. These are as follows:
1. Reduceenergydemandbyprovidingnaturalventilationandillumination,good
insulation, and shading as described in relation to climate change adaptation
2. Increaseenergyefficiencythroughtheuseofefficientservicesandappliances,
and low-energy lighting22 . Climate Change
291East Herts Council | East Herts District Plan 2018
3. Generateheatand/orpowerthroughon-sitelowandzerocarbontechnologies
such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP), solar panels, biomass boilers, or
heat pumps
4. Offsetting on-site carbon emissions through off-site means, for example
retrofitting existing buildings elsewhere, investment in energy schemes such
asdistrictheating,paymentintoacommunityinvestmentfund,oruseofGreen
Energy Tariffs. These are known as ‘allowable solutions’.

22.3.3 Thesefourapproachesareusuallyrepresentedasanenergyhierarchyasillustrated
in Figure 22.1 above, in which the most effective ways of reducing carbon dioxide
are shown at the base and must be fully explored first.
22.3.4 Wherever possible, developers should use reliable technologies and approaches
with a proven track record.
Policy CC2 Climate Change Mitigation
I. All new developments should demonstrate how carbon dioxide emissions will be
minimised across the development site, taking account of all levels of the energy
hierarchy. Achieving standards above and beyond the requirements of Building
Regulations is encouraged.
II.Carbon reduction should be met on-site unless it can be demonstratedthatthis is not
feasible or viable. In such cases effective offsetting measures to reduce on-site carbon
emissions will be accepted as allowable solutions.22 . Climate Change

22.4 Renewable and Low Carbon Energy
22.4.1 There are a variety of opportunities for generating clean energy. The Hertfordshire
Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Technical Study (July 2010) includes energy
opportunity maps for East Hertfordshire, which may assist in the selection of
appropriate carbon saving methods depending on the location of development
proposals.

22.4.4 The Council encourages proposals that embrace the use of renewable, zero and
low-carbon technology. Where proposals are within or near the urban areas of
settlements, applications should be supported by an air quality assessment, which
details proposed mitigation measures where necessary.
Policy CC3 Renewable and Low Carbon Energy

23.1.2 BuildingFuturesisaHertfordshireguidetopromotingsustainabilityindevelopment.
It includes a 'Water' module which sets out an approach to integrated water
management (IWM) which takes account of the water cycle. IWM aims to ensure
that the built environment is planned and designed to function in partnership with
the natural water environment, so that they can both be sustainable. IWM has a
number of sub-management processes, including minimising water consumption,
using and reusing alternative sources of water, managing surface water drainage,
and improving water quality.

23.2 Flood Risk
23.2.1 Water is an essential resource, but it can also be a hazard. The susceptibility of
land to flooding is a material planning consideration. The Council will resist any

approach to new development.
23.2.2 East Herts Council’s Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) contains maps
showing flood risks from various sources, including river and surface water flood
risk areas, and these represent a snapshot of flood risk at a given moment. The
Environment Agency publishes regular mapping updates, and the latest evidence
should be a material consideration in determination of planning applications.

23.4 Efficient Use of Water Resources
23.4.1 East Hertfordshire lies within one of the most water-stressed areas of the East of
England, which is itself one of the most water-stressed regions of the country.
Abstraction for human consumption can impact on the water environment, for
example contributing to low river levels. Installation of water efficient fixtures and
fittings is a cost-effective way to reduce water consumption at new development.
Dual-flush toilets and water butts for garden use are two examples, although there
are many other simple and low-cost measures which are potentially available to
developers.23 . Water

Water supply is the subject of a national policy debate about the configuration of
the water industry and consumer pricing, water metering, leakage reduction and
many other issues in this nationally regulated industry. Water supply companies
are required to demonstrate how they will meet these national standards in their
Water Resources Management Plans, which are published every five years.
23.4.4 East Herts will continue to explore the role that local policy can play in contributing
to the ultimate goal of water neutrality. Cost-effective measures such as the
requirement for water efficient fixtures and fittings at new development can make
a significant contribution over the next twenty years. The Council will continue to
work with partners to encourage the sustainable and responsible abstraction of
water.Thesemeasurescanhavesignificantenvironmentalbenefitsforthedistrict’s

theGovernment’sWaterEfficiencyCalculatorforNewDwellingsorotherappropriate
method by prior agreement with the Council.
For more information on the Water Efficiency Calculator for New Dwellings go to:
www.gov.uk
23.4.5 Building Regulations require that water consumption in new dwellings should not
exceed 125 litres per person per day. However, the Regulations allow for a lower
standardof110litresperpersonperdaytobeimplementedinwaterstressedareas.
Given that the Environment Agency has identified this area as being particularly
water stressed, it is considered appropriate to apply this standard.

Development must minimise the use of mains water by:
(a) Incorporating water saving measures and equipment;
(b)Incorporatingtherecyclingofgreywaterandutilisingnaturalfiltrationmeasures
where possible;
(c) Designing residential development so that mains water consumption will meet
a target of 110 litres or less per head per day.23 . Water

23.5 Sustainable Drainage
23.5.1 Sustainable Urban Drainage systems (SUDS) mimic natural drainage from a site
and enable rainwater to run back into natural systems, rather than the stormwater
drainage network. SUDS also treat run-off water to remove pollutants. This can
have multiple benefits:
1. increased recharge of groundwater and aquifers
2.reducedrunoffintothesewersystem(resultinginreducedenergyandchemical
costs of treatment)
3. improved groundwater quality via natural infiltration
4. reduced degradation of chalk stream habitats
23.5.2 Depending on the type of drainage techniques used, there can be flood reduction
benefits, pollution control benefits, and landscape and wildlife benefits. When
selecting appropriate drainage techniques, it is important to try to maximise the
number of benefits, and to prioritise the most sustainable approaches. These can
be set out in the form of a hierarchy. The SUDS hierarchy contained within the
Council’s SFRA is shown below:

23.5.3 The sustainable drainage hierarchy is intended to ensure that all practical and
reasonablemeasuresaretakentomanagesurfacewaterhigherupinthehierarchy
and that the amount of surface water managed at the bottom of the hierarchy is
minimised. The hierarchy is also relevant to paving of front gardens, where the
cumulative impact of impermeable paving on run-off rates may be considerable.
23.5.4 There are many practical issues of design, installation and maintenance in the
implementation of effective SUDS. The Flood and Water Management Act 2010
requires upper tier authorities to set up a Sustainable Urban Drainage System
(SUDS) Approving Body or ‘SAB’ to:
1.EvaluateandapproveSUDSproposalsfornewdevelopmentorredevelopment
where construction work would have drainage implications, and
2. AdoptandmaintainSUDSonschemesthatmeettheevaluationcriteriasetout
in the National SUDS Standards.
23.5.5 Drainage aspects of policy have become the responsibility of the County Council.
However, East Herts still has an involvement in drainage management and the
environmental and amenity aspects of drainage schemes. Hertfordshire County
CouncilhasproducedaSUDsDesignGuideForHertfordshire(March2015)which

III. Drainage should be designed and implemented in ways that deliver other policy
objectives of this Plan, including water use efficiency and quality, biodiversity, amenity

how it will be maintained in the long term.
IV. Where practicable, SUDS should be designed to ensure the sustainable drainage
networks have the additional capacity required to cope with infrequentadverse weather
conditions and therefore reduce flood risk.
23.6 Wastewater Infrastructure
23.6.1 Effective wastewater infrastructure is fundamental to sustainable urban life and
therefore investment and expansion are required. There are a number of Sewage
Treatment Works (STWs) in the district, notably at Bishop’s Stortford, Buntingford,
andatRyeMeadsinthefarsouthofthedistrict.Bishop’sStortfordandRyeMeads
STWs serve not only East Herts but also settlements within the catchment but
outside the district.

Local Planning Authorities in the Rye Meads catchment area, in accordance with
the Duty to Co-operate, to ensure that adequate capacity can be found at Rye
Meads, or that alternative waste water treatment options can be identified.
23.6.4 East Herts Council will seek to ensure that there is adequate wastewater network
infrastructure to serve all new developments. Developers will be required to
demonstrate that there is adequate infrastructure capacity both on and off the site
to serve the development and thatit would not lead to adverse amenity impacts for
existing or future users. In some circumstances this may make it necessary for
developerstocarryoutappropriateappraisalsandreportstoascertainwhetherthe
proposed development will lead to overloading of existing water and wastewater
infrastructure. Where there is a capacity constraint and no improvements are
programmed by the waste water treatment company, East Herts will require the
developer to provide appropriate improvements that must be completed prior to
occupationofthedevelopment.Unlessspecialcircumstancesapply,thisrequirement
is unlikely to apply to minor and householder development.

24.3 Noise Pollution
24.3.1 The impact of noise on the environment can be detrimental to health and quality of
life. There is therefore a need to control the introduction of noise sources into the
environment, as well as ensuring that new noise sensitive development is located
away from existing sources of significant noise.
24.3.2 One of the most common causes of noise pollution is from traffic noise. In East
HertstheproximityofbothLutonandStanstedAirportstothedistricthasaspecific
impact which needs to be taken into account when development proposals are
considered. The M11 and the A120 are the main roads serving Stansted Airport.
Any increase in activity associated with the airport will subsequently increase the
level of traffic on surrounding roads, exacerbating the potential for noise pollution.
24.3.3 Noise can also affect the tranquillity of an area. Tranquillity is a key characteristic
of the natural environment. Tranquil spaces, often located within the more rural
parts of the district, play a multi-functional role as part of the district's green
infrastructurenetwork. Theyattractvisitors,improvehealthandwellbeingbyoffering
a place to relax and exercise, provide a haven for wildlife and improve biodiversity
and enhance the character and identity of a place. These areas will be protected
from noise pollution to ensure that areas defined by their tranquillity are protected
from development that generates noise.
24.3.4 Where new noise generating development such as industrial and commercial and
outdoor sport and recreation uses are proposed, it is expected that they will be
located at an appropriate distance away from noise sensitive development i.e.
residential areas, schools and hospitals.
24.3.5 The Council is preparing a Noise Assessment Planning Guidance Document to
provideadviceforapplicantsofnoisegeneratingandnoisesensitivedevelopments.
It will also set out criteria for the preparation of such assessments as part of the
application process.24 . Environmental Quality

24.4 Light Pollution
24.4.1 Light pollution can cause sleep disturbance and annoyance and is caused by the
brightening of the night sky over inhabited areas and excessive brightness from
light causing high levels of glare. Dark night skies are important for health and
wellbeing,andfortheconservationofnaturalhabitatsandthebehaviourofnocturnal

therefore be designed carefully as part of the overall development proposal to
prevent light spillage and glare and to represent the minimum necessary for
commercial and security purposes. Schemes will be considered against the latest
national guidance and lighting standards including the ‘Guidance Notes for the
Reduction of Obtrusive Light (2011)’.

I. External lighting schemes must:
(a) Not have an unacceptable adverse impact on neighbouring uses or the wider
landscape;
(b) Be the minimum required for security and operational purposes;
(c) Minimise the potential glare and spillage;
(d) Minimise harm to the amenity of residents and road users and prevent impacts
on the local ecology.
II. Where appropriate, the District Council will seek to control the times of illumination.
24.5 Air Quality

24.5.5 Newvehicletechnology,suchashybridandelectricengines,hassignificantpotential
to improve air quality by reducing the use of traditional fuel vehicles, which are a
main source of pollutants. New technology takes time to establish and the lack of
electric charging points is cited as one of the main deterrents for individuals
considering switching to such vehicles. While some developers may argue that
there is currently insufficient demand to justify the installation of charging points, a
shifttothistypeoftechnologywillonlybeachievableifchargingpointsareinplace
toofferchoicetousersatlocationsofbothjourneyoriginanddestination. So,while
initial users of developments may drive traditional petrol/diesel vehicles, as older
vehicles reach the end of their lifespan there will be the opportunity for a greater
numbers of hybrid and electric vehicles to replace them if sufficient access to
charging points is in place and available. It is therefore considered that, as the
increased availability of charging points will of itself be likely to generate its own
demand, all major developments should incorporate sufficient numbers of electric
vehicle charging points.

Delivery and Monitoring
25 Delivery and Monitoring
25.1 Introduction
25.1.1 Implementation of the objectives and policies in the District Plan relies on the
provision of a wide range of infrastructure and services, the majority of which are
not provided by the District Council. Successful implementation of the District Plan
will therefore require the Council as local planning authority to take on the role of
co-ordinatororfacilitator,ratherthanadirectproviderofinfrastructureandservices
in most cases.
25.2 Infrastructure and Service Delivery
25.2.1 In order to guide the timely provision of infrastructure and services, and to provide
evidence for the need for corrective action where necessary, an Infrastructure
Delivery Plan (IDP) has been prepared. The IDP identifies both those facilities that
are needed district wide and those that are needed to support particular strategic
development.
25.2.2 The IDP will be updated as part of the Authority Monitoring Report (AMR) in
cooperation with delivery partners.
25.2.3 New development has the potential, individually and/or cumulatively to cause
significantstrainonexistinginfrastructureorservices.Allnewdevelopmentproposals
will need to take account of these wider impacts on existing communities. In some
cases proposals will impact upon strategic infrastructure, for example Rye Meads
SewerageTreatmentworks,secondaryschools,orthestrategichighwaysnetwork.
Developmentcanalsoleadtooff-siteimpactswithinthelocality,forexampleonthe
local road network or open space provision in existing residential or other areas.
Whereproposalscannotdemonstratethedeliverabilityofsupportinginfrastructure,
they will be refused.
25.2.4 Where monitoring undertaken through the IDP demonstrates that any key
infrastructure scheme/s (including, for example, a bypass for Hertford or second
Stort crossing related to development in the Gilston Area) would not be delivered
in a timely manner, this will trigger the need for the consideration of alternative
infrastructure provision to facilitate delivery of development, or a review or partial
review of the District Plan in accordance with Policy DEL1.

(c) Monitor capacity in infrastructure and services through annual updates of the
IDP and future infrastructure needs assessments;
(d)Consideralternativeinfrastructureprovision,orarevieworpartialreviewofthe
District Plan if evidence in the IDP indicates a changed outlook for the realistic
prospects for delivery of infrastructure to support development.
II. For individual development proposals, developers will be required to:
(a) Demonstrate, at the planning application stage, that adequate infrastructure
capacity can be provided both on and off site to enable the delivery of sustainable
developmentwithinthesite,thelocalityandthewiderarea,asappropriate.Where
proposals cannot demonstrate the deliverability of supporting infrastructure, they
will be refused;
(b) Ensure that development is phased to coincide with the delivery of additional
infrastructure or service capacity as set out in the IDP;
(c) Ensure that infrastructure assets and services are delivered to adoptable
standards. Suitable long-term management arrangements must be put in place
with a view to secure adoption by the appropriate authority in the longer term.
25.3 Developer Contributions
25.3.1 Planning Obligations will be sought under Section 106 of the Town and Country
Planning Act in order to secure financial contributions towards the provison of
infrastructure and services to support development. Planning obligations will only

25.4 Monitoring
25.4.1 Regularmonitoringofactualdevelopmentoutcomesagainsttheplanisanessential
part of ensuring that the plan is effective. Monitoring can indicate areas where
interventions may be needed to achieve the objectives of the plan, and may also
demonstrate the need for a review or partial review of the plan. The indicators
contained within Policies DEL3 (Monitoring Framework) and DEL4 (Monitoring of
the Gilston Area) will be monitored on an annual basis through the Authority
Monitoring Report, alongside a range of other contextual indicators.
Policy DEL3 Monitoring Framework
