Why have we produced this plan? 
 
How is it structured? 
This plan is divided to four parts. 
 Part 1 (this part) is the ‘summary ’ part and sets out why we are producing plan, 
and the process it must follow. 
 Part 2 is the ‘ context ’ part - this includes the background and justification for the 
plan, looks at what makes  Eden unique, and then sets out the vision and 
objectives it aims to deliver. 
 Part 3 is the ‘ spatial ’ part - this part includes four town plans for our main towns, 
showing what land we expect to see delivered, and for what. It also sets out a 
district - wide approach to steering new development and what our approach is 
for managing development in the rural areas. A key diagram is also included. 
 Part 4 is the ‘planning application’ part - this  part includes a suite of policies 
that we will use to assess the suitability of any planning applications that come to 
us 
for decision. 
What are the key points? 
The main proposals are: 
 4,356 new homes over the next 18 years, around half of which will be in Penrith. 
 New policies to encourage affordable and self-build properties in Eden’s smaller 
villages. 
 27.3 hectares  of new employment land, plus support for longer term growth at 
Newton Rigg college.  It provides  a clear planning  framework to  enable Eden District Council to 
get on and deliver the vision and objectives  unique to its area.  
 It indicates  what sort of new development will be acceptable  in Eden, and  
where planning  permission  will (and  will not) be granted.  
 It provides  certainty  for developers  and utility providers (and others 
investing  in an area)  on the best areas to focus.  
 It helps partner organisations  deliver their own priorities.  
 It attracts more funding and investment,  both from the private sector and  
also to the Council through infrastructure investment,  developer  
contributions,  growth funding and New Homes bonus, allowing  it to invest 
more in the future of Eden’s communities.  7  The Plan includes maps, which show where new development is anticipated. 
Where does it cover and how long for? 
The Plan covers Eden District excluding the area in the Lake District National Park. 
Specific land allocations are made to the four main towns of Penrith, Alston, Appleby 
and Kirkby Stephen. The Plan covers the period 2014 to 2032. 
What informed the plan? 
The plan is founded on a robust evidence base prepared over many years, as set out 
in the next section. A wide variety of stakeholders and the public informed its  
contents. In particular we produced and consulted on a ‘Preferred Options’ version of 
this plan back in July 2014. A Sustainability Appraisal has been produced to assess 
how policies and proposals will help achieve environmental, social and economic 
objectives. 
As part of the plan preparation we also looked at alternative options, including where 
new development should happen, how much there should be, and what policies are 
needed to help deliver it. 
The plan is also informed by the 2010 ‘Core Strategy’  and policies which this plan 
replaces, as well as policies which were ‘saved’ from the 1996 Local Plan. Appendix 
1 shows which policies in this Plan will replace those policies. 
All of these documents are available on the Council’s website at 
www.eden.gov.uk/planning-and-development/planning-policy-for-eden  
How will we know if it’s working? 
We keep careful track of how our policies and decisions are making a difference, and 
report this regularly to the public. Each of the policy sections in this plan includes a 
table on how we will monitor progress. An Annual Monitoring Report (AMR) will be 
prepared to indicate the extent to which the policies are being achieved and to 
identify any changes required if a policy is not working as planned. 8  1. Background to the Plan 
This section sets out some of the background to the plan and its preparation, and 
shows the area it covers. 
1.1 About this Plan 
1.1.1 This document is a full Local Plan, which covers Eden District for the years 2014 to 
2032. 
1.1.2 Work on the plan was informed by various pieces of evidence and feedback. This is 
included in key supporting documents underpinning this Plan which are available on 
our website. 
1.1.3 The plan is informed by numerous technical studies. A full list of supporting 
evidence can be found at Appendix 3, but of particular note: 
 A Sustainability Appraisal assessed t he extent to which emerging policies and 
proposals will help to achieve relevant environmental, social and economic 
objectives. This  helped inform which sites and policies we included. 
 A Land Availability Assessment (LAA) and Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment (SHMA) looked at housing supply and need. The LAA shows all 
available housing and employment land and assessed whether it is  suitable and 
deliverable. The SHMA establishes how many houses we think we will need 
(known as the Objective Assessment of Need) and looks at the need for the 
types of housing, including the need for affordable housing. 
 A Habitats Regulation Assessment Screening Opinion , which establishes 
whether  there will be any impact on wildlife sites of European importance. It 
concluded that subject to appropriate mitigation measures, which are outlined, 
risks can be acceptably avoided and/or mitigated. 
1.1.4 Work on the plan is supported by two ‘project management’ reports: 
 A Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) informs how we will consult the 
public and other interested organisations when preparing this plan. 
 A Local Development Scheme (LDS), sets out the timetable and project plan 
under which we will do so. 
1.1.5 Both were adopted in December 2013. 
1.1.6 The plan also takes into account what views have been expressed so far: 
 A Responses to Consultation Report summarises what everyone has said in 
response to our earlier consultation on our ‘preferred options’ draft, which we 
published in July 2014, as well as the informal consultation on settlement 
hierarchy and the draft LAA and SHMA we published in July 2015. 9  1.2 Where does this Plan Cover? 
1.2.1 Eden District Council is responsible for the preparation of the Local  Plan for the 
whole of the area for which it was the local planning authority at the time of the plan’s 
submission. This includes the whole of Eden District apart from that area which was  
within the Lake District National Park (as shown on Map 1). 10  Map 1 - The Area of the Plan 
 
 
 
 
1.2.2 In August 2016  the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales National Parks were extended 
within and into parts of Eden District. Policies in this plan will continue to apply and be 
used by the Park Authorities for these areas until they are replaced by policies in new 
National Park Local Plans at some point in the future. 11  2 Context - Issues, Vision and Objectives 
2.0.1 This section shows how we have put together this plan, and sets out the reasons 
why we think it needs to contain the policies and site allocations it does. This  
section aims to help the reader understand the thought process that went into its 
production and how it structurally ‘hangs together’. 
2.0.2 In more detail this section: 
 Contains a brief description or portrait of Eden and what makes it unique. 
 Analyses the main issues for the district, looking at its strengths, wea knesses, 
opportunities and threats. 
 Sets out a vision of where we want to be based on this analysis. 
 Develops a series of objectives, grouped around five themes. These themes 
provide the overall structure for much of the plan. 
2.0.3 Policies are then developed and are then grouped around objectives and themes. 
2.1 Portrait of Eden 
2.1.1 This section is our starting point, and provides some of the context around which we 
must build our plan. Should you want more information or statistics about Eden, 
these are availab le in our Annual Monitoring Report. All statistics are taken from the 
Office for National Statistics unless stated otherwise via a footnote. 
Eden is large and sparsely populated… 
2.1.2 The district of Eden lies  in eastern Cumbria and has an area of 2,156 km2, making it 
the largest non-metropolitan area in England and Wales. In 2011, the population of 
Eden was  52,564, meaning it has the lowest population density of any English 
district. A high proportion of the population is scattered throughout small villages 
across  a wide rural area, with more than half the population (29,361 or 55.8%) living 
outside the four main towns of Penrith, Alston, Appleby and Kirkby Stephen. 
…and it’s beautiful (and recognised as such) 
2.1.3 A substantial  part of the area contains landscapes which have been  recognised for 
their high quality and diversity. These include the North Pennines Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and significant parts of the Lake District 
National Park. Many other areas  also contribute to Eden’s beauty, including the 
Eden Valley, the Pennine foothills, Westmorland Fells, Howgills and Greystoke 
Forest. 
The district has attractive towns and villages… 
2.1.4 We have one major town (Penrith), with a ward population of 15,487, which benefits 
from major  transport intersections. Appleby (population 3,048) Kirkby Stephen 
(2,580) and Alston (2,088) are the three other main towns and offer a range of local 
services within high quality traditional townscapes. All our town centres include 12  conservation areas and are of an exceptional quality when it comes to the built 
environment. A further twenty conservation areas are designated in other villages. 
…and precious natural resources 
2.1.5 There are eighty-eight Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and Eden District 
also has, at Orton Scar and Great Asby Scar, some of the most extensive areas of 
limestone pavement in Britain. These are accorded the extra protection of 
designation as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) due to their international value, 
as is the River Eden and its tributaries as well as a further seven SAC’s/Special 
Protection Areas. The district also has many sites of regional and local importance 
that have less formal  designations such as 187 Local  Wildlife Sites but which are 
equally important and worthy of protection. 
It has an exceptional built environment… 
2.1.6 Eden has an abundance of seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth century 
buildings. There are no less than 1,958 Listed Buildings, and 296 Scheduled 
Monuments in the district1. Twenty-four Conservation Areas (of which six are within 
the Yorkshire Dales National Park) have been designated reflecting their special 
character and several historic parks and gardens have been identified as of 
particular value. There are also many Scheduled Ancient Monuments and sites of 
recognised archaeological value. 
…and is well connected 
2.1.7 We have excellent road transport links running east/west along the A66 trunk road 
and north/south via the M6 and A6. The West Coast Mainline provides direct rail 
links to the north and south (including London, Manchester and Edinburgh)  and 
regional railways link from  Carlisle to Leeds (via Settle/Carlisle). 
It’s grown and is projected to grow… 
2.1.8 From 2001 to 2011, the population of Eden rose by 2,785 people, a 5.6% increase. 
Household numbers are now expected to grow more rapidly than population as 
households become smaller in size. We are expecting that approximately 3,700 
new households will form between the years 2014 and 2031  - a 14% increase. 
…yet the population is ageing 
2.1.9 In line with national trends, the district has an ageing population. However in Eden 
this is more pronounced. The district has a slightly older age profile than that of 
England (27% over 60 compared to 21%) and 30% are aged under 30 compared to 
37% in England. In Cumbria, Eden and South Lakeland have the oldest age profile 
and lowest number of young people. 
 
1 Historic England Heritage List, June 2015.  13  Our residents are well educated… 
2.1.10 The qualification profile of Eden is higher than for the North West and Great Britain. 
When compared with the other  districts in Cumbria, both Eden and South Lakeland 
have a relatively greater proportion of residents with degree-level qualifications. The 
percentage of adults that have low literacy skills in Eden is lower than in the North 
West and England, but the percentage of adults that have low numeracy and ICT 
skills is slightly higher than in the North West and England. 
…and employment rates are high 
2.1.11 The unemployment rate in Eden was 2.9% in 2014. This is considerably lower than 
the North West average of 7.1%, and the national  average of 6.2%. The 
employment rate is high (83.4%) when compared to the North West rate of 69.2% 
and the Great Britain rate of 72.4%. 
But wages are low… 
2.1.12 Average gross weekly full time earnings for jobs in Eden in 2014  were £40 9, 
compared to an average of £521 for Great Britain2. There is a dependence on low 
wage jobs for many, primarily in the administrative, retail, agricultural and tourism 
sectors. 
Housing is expensive for many… 
2.1.13 House prices in Eden are amongst the highest in Cumbria. The median house price 
in Eden in 2014 was  £192,822; this figure has increased from £183,866 in 2013  and 
it remains much higher than the figure for Cumbria as a whole of £140,864 and 
somewhat higher than the national average of £172,7943. 
2.1.14 The median household income in Eden in 2014  was only £26,333, below the 
national average of £28,4664. This means the median house price in Eden in 2014 
was 7.3 times the average household income; making the private housing market 
inaccessible to many local people. The figure nationally is 6.1. 
2.1.15 There is also a high rate of 1,315 houses in Eden being used as second homes 
compared to national averages5 - around 5.7% of the total stock. This can impact 
upon the availability and costs of housing for local people.

5 Eden District Council, Council Tax Register, 2013  14  2.2 Eden District - Strengths, Weakness es, Opportunities and Threats 
2.2.1 Next, we carry out an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 
threats for the district. This  helps us think about where forward planning and this plan 
can best respond to some of the issues identified, and als o helps explain to the 
reader why we think we need  this plan in particular. 
 
Strengths: Weaknesses:  
 
 Excellent transport links to the 
main settlement of Penrith. Direct 
rail link to London, Manchester  
and Edinburgh. 
 Open, rolling landscapes, with 
rugged peaks forming dramatic  
horizons leading to an abundance 
of unique and much valued 
countryside. 
 Highly prized as a place for 
outdoor recreation. 
 High levels of employment, 
particularly self-employment, and 
a skilled workforce in the technical, 
trade and tourism sectors. 
 Good schools, accessible 
countryside and a safe 
environment mean Eden is 
attractive to families. 
 Fine historic environment, large 
numbers of listed buildings, 
conservation areas and ancient 
monuments. 
 Town centres have retained their 
local distinctiveness and have 
more local businesses - they have 
largely avoided moving to being 
‘clone towns’. 
 Low levels of crime.  Sparse settlement patterns means reliance on 
the car. 
 Skilled workforce but a low wage economy, few 
young professionals, due to a lack of high value 
financial/professional jobs. 
 High proportion of part time working. 
 
 VAT  registration rates are low, meaning few 
local businesses being formed. There are also 
many micro businesses with limited potential for 
growth. 
 Limited supply of sites for modern business 
premises. 
 Falling investment in existing tourism products. 
 
 Ageing population gives rise to skills  shortages 
and healthcare challenges. 
 Loss of younger  people due to lack of job 
opportunities (particularly at graduate level), 
higher education places and lower house prices 
elsewhere. 
 Limited choice in new housing, plus affordability 
issues. Historical  lack of new housing supply, 
particularly in Penrith. 
 Current housing stock is dominated by larger 
and older homes and may be unsuitable for an 
aging or younger  population. 
 Current housing stock suffers from poor thermal 
insulation. 
 
 Large number of second homes in some areas. 
 
 Some pockets of deprivation, particularly in the 
Penrith South, East and Pategill wards. 15  Opportunities: Threats:  
 
 The rural beauty and tranquillity of 
the district, together with its  many 
heritage assets provide an asset, 
which can be used to attract 
investment and employment, as 
well as wealthy incomers. 
 High speed broadband may mean 
high value businesses may be 
more able to (re)locate. 
 Potential development of Newton 
Rigg College and employment 
sites around the strategic road 
network and M6 corridor at Penrith 
can provide opportunities for new 
higher value jobs. 
 Strong developer  interest in 
housing, buoyed by strong 
demand. 
 Opportunities to improve the 
market towns offer to provide a 
range of services in an attractive 
and compact environment.  Loss of younger  population, gain of older 
people from elsewhere may mean a dwindling 
workforce. 
 Wealthy incomers can out-price locals when 
buying housing. 
 Lack of funding and increasing prices widen the 
housing affordability problem. 
 Accommodation and health care for an 
increasing elderly population is expensive to 
provide, particularly across a large and sparse 
geography. 
 Housing rental  market likely to increase, rents 
may be cheaper elsewhere in Cumbria. 
 Challenges of maintaining services and 
facilities in rural communities. 
 Higher fuel prices may have a disproportionate 
impact on rural communities. 
 Lack of existing high value/technology jobs 
means new high wage jobs are difficult to 
attract. 
 
 Smaller more affordable and 
starter homes would help those in 
low wage jobs get on to the 
housing ladder and retain younger 
people in the district. More 
rent/low cost affordable housing in 
villages would stop younger 
people from moving away and 
support local services. 
 Potential to add value to local 
produce e.g. food and drink, 
forestry and agriculture. 
 Potential to market the Eden 
Valley for tourism and outdoor 
pursuits based on its high 
landscape value and tranquil  
nature.  Loss of village services. 
 
 Lack of differentiation in employment 
opportunities compared to neighbouring centres 
at Carlisle and Kendal, bringing competition 
between areas for new development. 
 New development risks undermining the 
character of the area. 
 Climate change may bring increased risk of 
flooding, droughts, pests & diseases, crop 
failure. 
 New development risks undermining the 
historic environment and the unique identity 
and character  of the area. 16  2.3 Eden in 2032 - The Vision 
2.3.1 Next, a vision is created - this aims to articulate where we want to be by the end of 
the plan period. 
 
A Vision for Eden 
Eden will build on its strengths and address its  weaknesses to deliver improved 
quality of life for its existing a nd next generation of residents, an improved 
experience for its visitors, and will be better placed to attract investment and jobs 
into the district. 
It will continue to prize the natural and built assets which make it unique, and will 
enhance and protect them not only for their own sake, but also as a means of 
attracting investment and visitors to the area. Eden’s towns and villages will have 
retained the characteristics that provide their character and charm. 
By 2032 Eden will have created a more diverse and sustainable population, 
particularly in terms of age. The provision of housing, jobs, facilities and transport 
will be based on evidenced need both to meet the needs of older people and to 
encourage younger people to stay in the district or relocate from elsewhere. 
Eden’s population will have easy access to a good range of services, facilities and a 
range of housing to meet its  full needs, including affordable housing. 
The population will continue to enjoy high employment rates and have good  access 
to job opportunities, however, the district will be able to offer a more diverse range 
of employment opportunities, and contain a better paid, more highly skilled work 
force. 
New employment development will be located to take advantage of Penrith’s 
excellent transport links and the campus at Newton Rigg in Penrith will have 
developed to provide high quality training, education and research relevant to 
learners of all ages within and beyond Eden district. 
Agriculture and forestry will continue to be important to the economic base of the 
area with rural diversification playing a significant role in supporting these industries. 
A vibrant and thriving tourist and service sector will still significantly contribute to the 
local economy, attracting day and staying visitors. 
Services and facilities will continue to be supported and prized in the rural villages. 
A sense of local community and belonging will be maintained and reinforced, with 
decisions made at community level as far as possible. 
2.3.2 Specific visions have also been  developed for each of the four main towns and 
Eden’s Rural Areas. These are set out in Section 3. 
2.4 Objectives 
2.4.1 Next, we take the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, together with 
the vision outlined above and develop themes  around which objectives and policies 
will be grouped and then what policies we may need to help deliver these 
objectives. Policies in this plan are consequently based around the following

3.0.1 This section sets out the approach we will take to guiding and allocating sites for 
new development in Eden. The following policy sets out our ‘settlement hierarchy’ 
and shows which areas we expect to be the focus for residential, employment and  
commercial provision. 
3.1 Policy LS1 - Locational Strategy 
New development will be distributed as set out below: 
Our Main Town - Penrith: Penrith will benefit from sustain ed development 
appropriate to that of a larger town. There will be improved town centre facilities 
and public realm; development of strategic employment sites around the town; 
provision of large scale new housing development to the east and north; and an 
improving strategic road network and public transport system. 
Market Towns - Alston, Appleby and Kirkby Stephen: Market towns will be the 
focus for moderate development appropriate to the scale of the town, including 
new housing, the provision of new employment and improvements to 
accessibility. 
Key Hubs – Thirteen Key Hubs will be the focus for development to sustain local 
services appropriate to the scale of the village and its hinterland, including new 
housing, the provision of employment and improvements to accessibility. Unless 
proposed in this plan, new housing developments which would increase the size 
of a village by more than 10% on a single site will not normally be supported. 
Proposals will only be acceptable where they respect the historic charact er and 
form of the village. 
The Key Hubs are: Armathwaite, Brough and Church Brough, Culgaith, 
Greystoke, High and Low Hesket, Kirkby Thore, Langwathby, Lazonby, 
Nenthead, Plumpton, Shap, Stainton, Tebay. 
Smaller Villages and Hamlets: Development of an appropriate scale, which 
reflects: the existing built form of the settlement, adjoining and neighbouring 
development to the site, and the service function of the settlement, will be 
permitted within Smaller Villages and Hamlets, to support the development of 
diverse and sustainable communities. Development in these locations  will be 
permitted in the following circumstances: 
 Where it reuses previously-developed land (PDL) defined in Appendix 2. 
 Where it delivers new housing on greenfield sites only, in accordance with 
the local connection criteria defined in Appendix 6. 
The Smaller Villages and Hamlets are: Aiketgate, Ainstable, Blencarn, 
Blencow, Bolton, Brackenber, Brampton, Brough Sowerby, Brougham, Burrells, 
Calthwaite, Catterlen, Cliburn, Clifton, Clifton Dykes, Colby, Crackenthorpe, 
Croglin, Crosby Garrett, Crosby Ravensworth, Dufton, Eamont Bridge, Edenhall, 21  Ellonby, Gaisgill, Gamblesby, Garrigill, Glassonby, Great Asby, Great Musgrave, 
Great Ormside, Great Salkeld, Great Strickland, Greystoke Gill, Hackthorpe, 
Hartley, High Bank Hill, Hilton, Hunsonby, Hutton End, Ivegill, Johnby, Kaber, 
Keld, Kelleth, Kings Meaburn, Kirkoswald Knock, Laithes, Lamonby, Leadgate, 
Little Asby, Little Musgrave, Little Salkeld, Little Strickland, Long Marton, 
Longdale, Low Braithwaite, Low Moor, Maulds Meaburn, Melkinthorpe, Melmerby, 
Milburn, Millhouse, Morland, Motherby, Murton, Nateby, Newbiggin (Ains), 
Newbiggin (Dacre), Newbiggin (Temple Sowerby),  Newbiggin- on-Lune, Newby, 
Newton Reigny, North Dykes, Old Town (High Hesket), Orton, Ousby, Outhgill, 
Pallet Hill, Raisbeck, Ravenstonedale, Reagill, Renwick, Roundthorn, 
Roundthwaite, Ruckcroft, Sandford, Skelton, Skirwith, Sleagill, Sockbridge and 
Tirril, Soulby, South Dykes, Southwaite, Temple Sowerby Unthank (Gamblesby), 
Waitby, Warcop, Winskill, Winton, Yanwath. 
All development must be of a high quality design and will be restricted to infill 
sites, which fill a modest gap between existing buildings within the settlement; 
rounding off, which provides a modest extension beyond the limit  of the 
settlement to a logical, defensible boundary; and the reuse of traditional  rural  
buildings and structures, subject to the criteria set out in Policy RUR3. Villages 
have been identified on the basis that they contain a coherent and close knit 
group of ten or more dwellings, which are well related and in close proximity to 
each other, or clustered around a central element or feature, as opposed to areas 
of scattered and poorly related development. 
Other Rural Areas (outside the Key Hubs and Smaller Villages and Hamlets) 
– Development will be restricted to the re-use of traditional buildings, the provision 
of affordable housing as an exception to policy only, or where proposals accord 
with other policies in the Local  Plan. Some market housing may be acceptable in 
accordance with the criteria in Policy HS1. To qualify as rural exceptions housing 
the site must be in a location considered suitable for the development of 
affordable housing. 
Evidence will need to be given as to why the scheme’s benefits  to the locality are 
such that it justifies an exception to policy. 
Where a neighbourhood plan or order has been  brought forward to increase the 
amount of development above the levels envisaged under this policy this will take 
any precedence over policies in this plan.  22  This strategy is illustrated in the following key diagram: 
 
Explanation 
3.1.1 Our settlement hierarchy is based on a fourfold classification of settlements, 
reflecting the role and function of settlements within the district of Eden. 
3.1.2 The Main Town - Penrith. We expect that Penrith will continue to be the main centre, 
with a range of housing provided to meet the needs of its residents and facilitate 
further economic growth. Gilwilly Industrial Estate / Eden Business Park will continue 
to develop and provide an enhanced provision of employment floorspace. New 
longer-term areas for employment growth are included at Newton Rigg and Skirsgill. 
New strategic housing sites are allocated to the east and north of the town. 
3.1.3 The Market Towns - Alston, Appleby and Kirkby Stephen. These towns have 
traditionally acted as vital ‘service hubs’ with a wider rural  hinterland. They provide 
the widest range of jobs, shops and services and have the most frequent public 
transport service, which provides a realistic alternative to the private car.  
3.1.4 Thirteen ‘ Key Hubs’ have been identified where we expect modest amounts of 
market led development to occur, to help meet local need  and enable services  to be 
protected and enhanced. On non-allocated sites, housing development which 
 
 
 
 
 
 23  increases the size of a village by more than 10% on a single site will not normally be 
supported. A proposal that would increase the size of the village by more than 10% 
may be supported where the particular circumstances and context of the 
development is appropriate and the development respects the historic character and 
form of the village. Villages are identified as hubs if they contain more than one 
hundred properties and a primary school, or a GP surgery. In addition, a range of 
criteria, including the provision of retail and transport facilities, was used to select the 
most sustainable settlements as Key Hubs. It is accepted that the level  of service 
provision, and size of villages could fluctuate over the plan period . However the list of 
key hubs identified is fixed until any future review of the Local Plan. 
3.1.5 One hundred and two ‘Smaller Villages and Hamlets’ have been identified where no 
sites will be allocated for development, but where small scale, sensitive development 
will be allowed to help meet local demand, providing it is limited to infill or ‘rounding 
off’ development or the re- use of redundant traditional  rural buildings and structures 
only. The scale of modest infill and rounding off development will be proportionate to 
the scale and form of the site and the settlement within which it is located. This  
approach will consider proposals on a case by case basis, based on their individual 
merits, and against other policies of relevance within the Local Plan, and is  
considered preferable to a prescriptive approach particularly given the diversity of the 
Smaller Villages and Hamlets within the District. The scale of development would 
also be self-constrained by the overarching requirement for the proposal to meet 
local demand only and be restricted by the local connection criteria identified in 
Appendix 6. Proposals of between 6 and 10 units, or where the total gross  internal 
floor space exceeds 1000m2, will be expected to provide a financial contribution 
towards the provision of some affordable housing for local occupancy. Villages and 
hamlets have been  identified on the basis that they are a coherent and close knit 
grouping of ten or more dwellings, which are well related and in close proximity to 
each other, or clustered around a central element or feature, as opposed to areas of 
scattered and poorly related development. Where new housing is located on 
greenfield land a local connection restriction will apply. A local connection restriction 
will not apply to new housing located on previously developed land. The Council 
recognises that there may be some villages and hamlets where local communities 
aspire to bring forward additional  development or allocate sites to help support local 
services. The Council will offer support in these circumstances to help them develop 
neighbourhood plans or orders to deliver these aspirations. 
3.1.6 Outside these areas new development will be limited to the sensitive re- use of 
existing traditional buildings, essential agricultural  workers dwel lings, for 100% 
affordable ‘exceptions’ housing only or where proposals accord with other policies in 
the Local  Plan. This policy aims to recognise that sporadic development in the 
countryside must be avoided, but there may be rare cases where schemes come 
forward which would be an asset to the district. 
3.1.7 This hierarchy and distribution is intended to endure. Should the function of 
settlements change or there be significant changes to the pattern of facilities this 
approach will be reviewed as part of a revi ew of this plan.  3.2 Policy LS2 - Housing Targets and Distribution

These proportions should not be seen as annualised caps to provide flexibility in spatial planning. 
Housing targets for the Key Hubs are included in Policy RUR1. 
24 A minimum of  242 homes  per year (a total of 4,356) will be built in  Eden District  over the eighteen  years  between  2014/15  and 2031/32.  
New housing  will be developed  throughout  the district  to ensure  a rate of housing completions  in accordance  with the following targets  and 
proportions:  25 
 
 Explanation 
3.2.1 This policy sets out future development rates  in the towns and villages. The 
overal l figure for the district has been set at 242 homes per year. This followed 
technical work which revealed a need  to reconcile projected low levels of future 
change in the number of households already here and historic low levels of house 
building on the one hand, with high levels of in migration from older people 
moving in from elsewhere in the country and a strong demand for affordable 
housing and jobs from people here on the other. 
3.2.2 Because of past shortfalls in housing provision we will manage the rate of housing 
that comes  forward to encourage the take up of new sites in the early years of this 
plan. 
3.2.3 The individual town and rural plans in this document set out the future 
development rates for housing in the towns and villages. 
3.2.4 The delivery of housing over time is set out in the following housing trajectory. 
Trajectories are a forward planning tool, designed to monitor both past and 
anticipated completions across a period of time. As they look forwards as well as 
backwards, they can help indicate at an early stage whether any action needs to 
be taken to release additional sites or whether the problem will ‘sort itself out’ with 
already identified sites coming on stream later on to make up any shortfall. This 
trajectory will be updated every year as part of our Annual Monitoring Report. 
 
   
 
 
26 27 
 
 3.2.5 To promote the supply of new housing, this plan incorporates a mechanism to 
make sure that new housing is developed within the time frame of the plan. Future 
Growth sites are identified in the table below and on the Policies Map. These sites 
represent additional suitable land for housing development that builds in flexibility 
in the supply of land if housing from other sources  does not materialise. Where 
housing completions fall more than 20%* behind the expected rate of delivery, 
implied by the annual target provision set out in Policy LS2, the Council will 
consider the reasons for this and may, as a consequence, resolve to release the 
Future Growth sites for development if land shortage is considered to be a central 
consideration. 
*Where housing completions in the District’s  four towns collectively fall more than 
20% behind the combined expected rate of delivery for the four towns, identified 
Future Growth sites within these towns may be released for development. 
ie Future Growth sites will be released when: 
Collective housing completions for the Towns (Penrith + Alston + Appleby + Kirkby 
Stephen) > 20% behind the expected rate of delivery. 
Where housing completions for the District’s  13 Key Hubs collectively fall more 
than 20% behind the combined expected rate of delivery for the Key Hubs, 
identified Future Growth sites within these Key Hubs may be released for 
development. 
ie Future Growth sites will be released when: 
Collective housing completions for the Key Hubs > 20% behind the expected rate 
of delivery.

28 29  Reason for the Policy 
3.2.6 A locational strategy is necessary to identify where new land allocations will be 
made. The intended proportions for the land allocations are also set out in order to 
provide the necessary clarity for local communities, the development and 
construction industry, those public bodies and private companies charged with the 
provision of vital infrastructure and also public service providers such as health 
and education. It also demonstrates where the Council will and will not permit 
larger scale new development. 30  3.3 A Town Plan for Penrith 
3.3.1 Penrith is the largest town in Eden. The town has many enviable qualities and 
provides an exceptional quality of life well above that of most other similarly sized 
towns. Penrith retains the atmosphere of a historic market town, bringing a strong 
local distinctiveness, with Penrith Castle, narrow streets and passageways as 
remnants of defence against border raids  during the 9th and 10th centuries. The 
town centre is designated as a Conservation Area, with its distinctive red 
sandstone buildings and many listed buildings. Penrith benefits from excellent 
transport links via the M6 motorway and A66 trunk road, and is directly connected 
to London, Manchester and Edinburgh via the West Coast rail line. There is rapid 
access to some of the highest quality outdoor  environments in the country, 
including the Eden Valley, North Pennines and Lake District National Park. Good 
schools and safe environment also mean Penrith is an attractive place for families 
to be. The town has a strong local food economy – it is estimated that local food 
supports 600 jobs at retailers and suppliers around the town, and its sales help 
support £16.8 million turnover  at supply chain businesses6. These many 
advantages mean that the town benefits from an abundance of assets  that should 
allow it to flourish in the future. 
3.3.2 Set against this there remain challenges to address. The town has a skilled 
workforce but a low wage economy, and there are few young professionals, due to 
a lack of high value financial and professional jobs. This means the town risks 
losing younger people, either  due to them taking up jobs elsewhere or because 
they seek lower rents and prices in other parts of Cumbria. The West Coast 
Mainline and M6 motorway corridors create prominent artificial elements in the 
landscape and present a hard physical edge to the urban area (and physical  and 
psychological barriers to east-west movement) and there is no direct link  between 
industrial areas at Gilwilly and the M6 motorway. For certain traffic movements it 
remains more convenient to travel  through the town centre, increasing possible 
congestion. There has also been a historical lack of new housing supply, meaning 
current housing stock is dominated by older homes and may be unsuitab le for an 
ageing or younger population. There is also a relatively low provision of open 
space, footpaths, bridleways and green corridors. 
 
 
 
6 From Field to Fork – Penrith. Campaign to Protect Rural England, June 2012. A Vision for Penrith  
 
Penrith  will build  on its role as a  multifunctional  centre serving a wide rural 
catchment.  It will retain its distinct identity  as an historic  market  town,  and be the 
focus  for employment,  creativity,  learning, socialising,  culture, health,  and well- 
being  for those  in and near the town.  The built form will continue to respect  the 
wider  landscape  that shapes  the town.  31   
 
 
3.4 Objectives 
3.4.1 Objectives for Penrith are partly informed by previous work carried out on the 
strategic masterplan for the town. This masterplan, commissioned by the Council, 
was funded by the Homes and Communities Agency and produced by consultancy 
AECOM and published in 2011. 
3.4.2 The objectives for Penrith are: 
 To retain the characteristics that make Penrith unique, conserving and 
enhancing the historic  environment of the town and making sure the planning 
of major new development is shaped by existing landscape character. 
 To improve connections to and from the M6 - creating a ‘strong front door’ to 
the town, and promoting the use of Junction 41 of the M6. 
 To manage traffic flows to avoid pressure on the town centre and encourage 
walking and cycling. 
 To improve social infrastructure - schools, healthcare, recreation and 
community facilities. 
 To provide local affordable housing. 
 To widen the employment offer, attracting higher wage employment and 
retaining and attracting graduates. 
 To make sure new development contributes to new physical and social 
infrastructure, including roads and services. It will be a place  which  people  care about  and engage  in the life of their town.  The 
town  centre will offer a  range  of services  facilities  and events  that offer a rich and 
diverse  experience  which draws  people  into the town centre to shop,  relax  and 
have  fun, as well as helping  retain local expenditure  within  the town.  
There  will be a recognised  ‘heart’  to the town  in the  centre  of the Conservation  
Area, which  will offer a safe and engaging enviro nment  to pedestrians,  visitors  and 
shoppers.  
New homes will be provided  to help balance  the population,  support  new 
employment  opportunities  and provide  affordable  housing to those  already  in the  
district.  The District  and County  Council,  agencies,  landown ers and businesses  
will work  to encourage  and support  higher value  jobs in the district.  The range  and 
quality  of jobs will be improved,  with new sites developed  to provide strategic  
growth  and higher  value  employment.  
The town  will continue  to expand  its role as a welcoming tourism destination  and 
stop over point,  by providing  a range  of services  and making  the most  of its 
historic  environment  and natural  assets.  32   To retain younger people in the town. 
 To sustain existing and new shops and markets by bringing people together to 
make sure Penrith provides a unique, welcoming and locally distinctive 
shopping experience, and one which is different from the experience of using 
a supermarket or shopping centre. As part of this, to continue to hold special 
events such as the Winter Droving and Winter Festival even ts and the Food 
and Farming Festival, and work to attract and retain as much local spending 
within the town itself. 
 To retain and enhance civic space. 
 To protect and seek improvements to green infrastructure and the network of 
rights of way in the town. 
 To support new housing in town centres including unused spaces above 
shops. 33  3.5 Policy PEN1 - A Town Plan for Penrith 
 
The Town Plan for Penrith aims to deliver: 
New Homes - Land  upon which a minimum of 2,178 additional new homes could 
be built within the plan period will be provided in the town. The main locations for 
housing are at Carleton to the east, and Salkeld Road, White Ox Farm and 
Raiselands to the north. Additional land has been identified as potential locations 
for future growth and may be released if land supply comes forward below 
expectations. A site for Gypsy and Traveller use is also allocated as an extension 
to the existing site at Lakeland View, north of Penrith. 
New Jobs - An additional  11.91 hectares of employment land is allocated as an 
extension to Gilwilly Business Park and a further 3.29 hectares at Skirsgill. A 
longer-term strategic growth opportunity is identified at Newton Rigg College. 
New services and facilities - At least one new primary school will be needed to 
serve both the new and existing population of the town at Carleton. 
New Infrastructure - Improvements will be made to improve access to the 
Gilwilly Industrial estate and to aid movement around the town. 
Details of identified infrastructure requirements can be found in the Council’s  
Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Financial or other contributions will be sought from 
proposals which give rise to the need for new or improved infrastructure. The 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan identifies future infrastructure requirements and will 
be regularly updated. 
 
Explanation 
3.5.1 In considering options for new housing our preferred option is heavily influenced by 
the 2011 Penrith Masterplan, which provided a considered assessment of 
development opportunities around the town. It included a relatively even split of 
housing to the north and east. This plan now includes 10 sites capable of 
accommodating a minimum of 846 new homes. It is anticipated that housing sites to 
the east of the town will be delivered in the short to medium term, with sites to the 
north forming longer term growth opportunities. Indicative housing numbers for the 
Masterplan site E2 indicates a lower density to account for potential landscape 
impacts. Development sites to the north have been adjusted to reflect topographical 
constrain ts and curtailed to prevent unnecessary urban sprawl. The lower portion of 
site N2 is allocated without a dwelling capacity attached. The capacity of this part of 
the site can only be confirmed by the submission of a detailed planning application 
clearly demonstrating appropriate noise attenuation and mitigation via a noise 
assessment and a detailed layout supported by finished floor and site levels 
clarifying the scale and form of the proposal and serviced by an adoptable road and 
drainage network. To guard against possible under delivery Future Growth sites 
have been identified to the north of Penrith and at Carleton . These will be released 
for development if housing supply is below expectations . We are also required to 34  meet the needs of Gypsies  and Travellers and allocate sites to help meet need  and 
avoid unauthorised encampments being the only option for Gypsies and Traveller in 
the area. An expanded site for Gypsy and Traveller use is therefore allocated at 
Lakeland View, around a mile and a half north of Penrith. 
3.5.2 Penrith also remains a focus for employment growth, given its excellent transport 
connections and high quality of life. We have identified two employment sites which 
will provide suitable land to at least satisfy potential requirements coming forward 
during the plan period. In addition to land at Skirsgill south of the A66 an extension 
to the existing Gilwilly Industrial Estate (site 2A in the masterplan) is proposed. The 
plan does not currently allocate Eden Business Park (site 2B) given the issues 
surrounding viability and deliverability, particularly in respect of the delivery of a new 
access road to Junction 41 of the M6. It is important to note, however, that the Eden 
Business Park (Site 2B) remains a long-term strategic objective of Eden District 
Council, and whilst development of this site is not currently viable, the Council will 
continue to explore options, which may help unlock development and provide jobs 
at this site in the long-term. Similarly, the Council is supportive of long-term growth 
at Newton Rigg College and will work with the college to explore and deliver new 
employment in the area. 
3.5.3 Planning obligations for infrastructure needed to support  development in Penrith will 
be required in line with what is set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, which was 
prepared by the Council to support  the delivery and implementation of the Eden 
Local Plan.

Explanation 
3.6.1 This policy requires masterplans to be agreed with the Council for significant development 
at Penrith. This is because the Council does not wish to see development coming forward 
in a piecemeal or uncoordinated fashion. Each area need s to be planned carefully to 
create neighbourhoods that have a local distinctiveness and a definite sense of place 
appropriate to Penrith – in other words, to be as ‘Penrith’ as possible. They should also 
provide for a range of community facilities and be well integrated into the town and its 
surroundings. Masterplans will be expected to build on and take into account the existing 
strategic masterplan for Penrith and the Penrith Landscape and Visual Impact 
A
ssessment. 
3.6.2 Given the scale of development around t he town, masterplans will also be expected to 
assess the cumulative needs for infrastructure, taking into account demand generated by 
all masterplan sites in combination. Developers will be expected to help contribute to the 
provision of essential infrastructure, including highway improvements, schools, and other 
social infrastructure. This may take the form of financial contributions or serviced land. The 
Council, working together with the County Council wishes to take a collaborative approach 
with developers to the planning of significant new developments, and will wish to enter into 
Section 106 agreements (or put in place a Community Infrastructure Levy charging 
schedule) to make sure that supporting infrastructure is delivered in a timely, fair and equal 
manner. The Council will also seek to enter into a Planning Performance Agreement with 
developers to manage the process of delivery. 
3.6.3 The Habitats Regulation Assessment work underpinning this plan has identified that 
housing sites E1-E4 together with employment site MPC have the potential  to cause 
adverse impacts on the quality of the River Eden, which has European status as both a 
Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation. Adequate policy 
safeguards exist in this plan to avoid or mitigate impacts (principally through Policy ENV1). The remaining  strategic  sites in the north  and east of Penrith will  not be given  permission  
for development  until masterplans  for those  areas have  been  agreed  with the Council.  
Masterplans will be expected  to be in accordance  with the objectives  and outputs  
contained  in the 2011  masterplan  for Penrith.  
In order  to address  the cumulative  impacts  of development  potential,  applicants  will be 
expected  to work  with infrastructure providers  to demonstrate how the developments  will 
jointly  provide  and fund the physical  and social  infrastructure  necessary  to support  this 
amount  of development  in the town.  This may take the form of financial  contributions  or 
the provision  of appropriate  serviced  land.  
Masterplans should  be prepared  on a collaborative  basis and include  an agreed  approach  
to internal  layout,  housing type,  mix and tenure,  landscaping,  open  spac e, community  
facilities, access,  and design.  They  should  be used to create  attractive,  functional  and 
sustainable places,  which  respect  the character  of the town.  Their  preparation  should  
include  public  consultation.  
Principles  to be used  in the preparatio n of masterplans  are set out at Appendix 4. 38  It is imperative that these safeguards are properly implemented at the design and 
construction stage. Any applications for development will therefore be expected to 
incorporate measures to ensure there is no impact. In particular this will include the 
inclusion of sustainable drainage systems to avoid run off of surface water into the river. 
3.6.4 The following sites will be expected to adhere to agreed masterplans: 
 Carleton - Site E1. 
 Carleton - Land at Long Acres and Carleton Hall Farm - Sites E3 and E4. 
 Raiselands, White Ox Farm and Salkeld Road extensions - Sites N1/N1a, N2 and 
N3. 
Reason for this Policy 
3.6.5 To ensure the proper and effective planning of urban extensions in and around the town. 
3.7 Policy PEN3 - Newton Rigg Campus 
 
Explanation 
3.7.1 The success of Newton Rigg College (now part of Askham Bryan College)  may provide 
new opportunities to encourage new investment and job growth at Penrith in a way that 
both supports the ambitions of the college and provides new opportunities for others in the 
district. This plan therefore includes a policy aimed at supporting the long-term growth of 
the college and encouraging new employment uses on land at Newton Rigg. 
Reason for the Policy 
3.7.2 Penrith has an opportunity to further develop as a centre for higher and further education. 
This can be achieved by building upon  and continuing improvements at the campus at 
Newton Rigg. There exists a real opportunity to expand this facility and improve 
opportunities  not only for the young people of Eden but also the wider County. The 
campus is also ideally placed to potentially be a new long-term strategic area for 
employment growth for the district. The Council acknowledges  the contribution  that Newton  Rigg Campus  in Penrith makes  
to the economy  and educational  attainment  of Eden  and will: 
 Encourage  the development  of the campus,  including  the use of sites for expansion  
or employment  use. 
 Aim to help the college  build  on its  established  strengths  as a centre  for land based  
studies.  
 Support  any application  for knowledge  based  and digital  enterprises  to locate  where  
they can benefit  from the  expertise  of the college.  39  3.8 A Town Plan for Alston 
3.8.1 Alston lies within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is the 
highest market settlement in England, at about 1,000 feet above sea level. It has a unique 
and high quality built environment - much of Alston is designated as a Conservation Area 
and sits within an expansive a nd rugged landscape. 
3.8.2 The surrounding landscape provides a wildness, remoteness and tranquillity that is 
unrivalled in England. Although remote (Alston is around about 20 miles  from the nearest 
town and is surrounded by extensive areas of moorland) the town is nevertheless centrally 
located, lying midway between the east and west coasts and the northern and southern 
tips of Britain. It has a steep cobbled main street with a distinctive market cross, and many 
stone buildings dating from the 17th Century. The town is accessed via the A686, which 
runs from Penrith, through Alston and down onto the A69 about 5 miles before Hexham, 
and is located on the coast to coast walking and cycling routes, bringing in passing tourist 
trade. 
3.8.3 The area is rich in mineral resources (primarily lead and zinc) and lead was mined from 
Roman times until the 1980s. At its peak in the first half of the 19th Century the town’s 
population stood at around 7,000, more than three times what it is now. The town was 
affected by changes in the steel industry, which lead to the loss of its main employer in 
1980, which removed a quarter of all jobs in the town. However, although there has been 
job loss there are a high proportion of businesses in creative industries and a strong sense 
of community spirit and participation within the town, and a number of thriving businesses 
that trade well beyond the locality . In the summer of 2013, Alston Moor became the  
world’s first Social Enterprise Place. For its size, Alston Moor has a huge and varied social 
enterprise sector, with one social  enterprise for around every 50 households. 
3.8.4 There are also a number of challenges to address. The town is home to a very low wage 
economy and there are a declining number of younger people, meaning a long-term risk of 
the loss of local  services. The viability of developing housing and employment sites to 
meet local needs is also an issue, as are the relatively low stock of sports/recreational 
facilities. 
 
 A Vision for  Alston  
 
Alston will remain  a focus  for services  and facilities  for the surrounding  area.  The town  
will continue  to provide  a desirable  destination  for living and working  by making  best use 
of the assets  that make  it unique  - an outsta nding public realm,  a tranquil and beautiful  
location  and a close  community  who care for the town and its  people.  
The town  will attract new jobs to the area,  particularly  in the creative  arts and light 
industry  and will encourage  economic  activity  related  to outdoor  sports  and recreation.  It 
will offer a welcoming  base  for those  wanting  to appreciate  and value  what  the town  and 
the North  Pennines  Area  of Outstanding Natural Beauty  have  to offer.  It will offer an  
attractive  and value for money  location  for both passing  tourists  and those  who visit the 
town  and its  surroundings  for longer  periods.  40   
 
3.9 Objectives 
3.9.1 T he objectives for Alston are: 
 To attract and retain higher value employment. 
 To encourage reuse of existing/derelict buildings to retain, protect and enhance the 
historic environment. 
 To retain, respect and enhance the historic environment of the town. 
 To improve the tourism offer building on the town’s unique character  and location. 
 To improve the town’s  housing stock and increase provision of affordable housing. 
 To ensure the long term viability of local services. 
3.10 Policy AL1 - A Town Plan for Alston  
 
 The Town  Plan for Alston aims to deliver:  
 
New Homes - Land  for 131  additional  new homes will be provided  during  the plan 
period.  The main  location  for housing will  be Land  at Clitheroe.  
New Jobs - An additional  1.31 hectares  of employment  land is allocated  at the 
Skelgillside  workshops  (1.31  ha). Appropriate mixed  use development  that complements  
the site’s  heritage  will be supported  at High Mill. The population  will have stabilised  and there  will be a better  demographic  balance,  and 
younger  people  will be more likely  to stay in the Alston  area due to an increase  in 
affordable  housing,  employment  opportunities  and improvements  in local services  and 
facilities.   Land for housing is allocated on the following sites:

 TOTAL  1.31 
 
41 42  Reason for the Policy 
3.10.1  This policy sets out the main features of our development strategy for Alston up to the 
year 2032. 
3.11 Policy AL2 - Redevelopment in Alston Moor 
The redevelopment of traditional former dwellings in Alston Moor parish will be permitted 
where: 
 Evidence can be provided to demonstrate that the former dwelling was once in use 
at that location, and that the proposed redevelopment will make use of substantial 
remains and on site materials. 
 The resultant dwelling does  not materially exceed the footprint of the original  
building and reflects the scale, form and appearance of the original building when it 
was last in use. 
 The building is adjacent to or in close proximity to the public highway network and 
access is in place or can be created without damaging the surrounding area’s rural 
character. 
 It can be demonstrated that there is no significant impact on local  biodiversity, 
including on protected habitats and species. 
 Applications for development under this policy adhere to design principles set out in 
any design guides for the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. 
When granting permission for any development under this policy the Council will remove 
any permitted development rights, which would normally apply to the building and its  
curtilage. 
 
Explanation 
3.11.1 In Alston Moor parish the traditional economy of smallholding and mining has resulted in a 
pattern of settlement characterised by a large number of isolated dwellings. Many of these 
have been abandoned and allowed to deteriorate. If developed sensitively they are 
capable of providing additional accommodation at a reasonable cost while contributing to 
the preservation of the traditional settlement pattern. Policy AL2 recognises this 
exceptional situation and facilitates appropriate redevelopment. In the light of the 
exceptional nature of proposals of this type, stringent control will be exercised over the 
design and materials to be used in renovation and also over subsequent alterations. 
Conditions removing permitted development rights will be imposed at the time planning 
consent for development is granted. It should also be noted that buildings of the type 
concerned might provide a valuable habitat for wildlife, including endangered species such 
as bats or barn owls. 43  3.12 A Town Plan for Appleby 
3.12.1 Appleby is a highly attractive mark et town serving the Westmorland area, and was once 
the ancient capital of Westmorland. It lies on a bend on the River Eden, which meanders 
through the historic centre of the town and provides a strong natural feature which greatly 
adds  to the town’s charm, and provides the peace and quiet of beautiful riverside walks 
and picnic areas all within five minutes of the town centre. Home to around two and a half 
thousand people, Appleby lies approximately fourteen miles to the south east of Penrith. 
3.12.2 The town has a station on the Settle to Carlisle railway line, and is on or near to the Lakes 
and Dales  Loop Cycle Route, the Westmorland Way, the Pennine Way and the Coast to 
Coast path, all of which help bring in tourists to the area. The A66 Trans-Pennine tru nk 
road, which bypassed the town in 1982, provides access to Penrith and the M6 and the A1 
at Scotch Corner. 
3.12.3 The town has a multitude of assets - it has many architectural gems and a historic core 
designated as a Conservation Area and this, together with its many tree lined roads and 
sense of openness provide the relaxed feeling of a traditional and ancient market town. 
The town is home to the Appleby Castle whose origins lie in the 12th century and provides 
an excellent springboard for those wanting to explore both the Lake District and Yorkshire 
Dales National  Parks, as well as the dramatic landscapes nearer the town. Appleby also 
benefits from excellent schools and provides a safe environment, making it attractive to 
families. Eden Community Outdoors offer an indoor climbing wall, small cinema and 
meeting rooms, and there are adult education facilities at the Appleby Heritage Centre. 
The town is also home to the annual Appleby Horse Fair. 
3.12.4  Set against this are a number of challenges for the town. Major shopping facilities are 
some way away at Penrith or Carlisle and there is a limited retail offer, particularly for 
food and convenience goods. There is an increasing demographic imbalance, with 
increasing proportions of older people, the result of a loss  of younger people. The fine 
built environment also means that any new development has to be highly sensitive to 
historic assets and add to the character of the town. 
 A Vision for Appleby  
 
Appleby  will retain and  protect  the historical  assets that provide  it with its appeal.  It will 
look to  provide  new job opportunities  and housing choices  for those  living  in the area in a 
way that looks  forward  to its  future whilst  valuing  its past.  It will contain  a diverse  range  of 
shops  and services  to provide  a range  of facilities  for both visitors  and the population  
within  its catchment  area.  
It will continue to welcome  tourists  to the town,  and will continue to provide  a peaceful  and 
safe environment  and be a great  place  to bring  up a family.  Its range  of local shopping and  
community  facilities will be maintained  and improved.  44  3.13 Objectives 
3.13.1  The objectives for Appleby are: 
 To retain and respect the historic built environment of the town. 
 To attract and retain additional  tourism expenditure. 
 To provide new jobs opportunities in skilled trades and services. 
 To increase the range and type of housing available to local people. 
 To ensure a range of local  services are maintained. 
3.14 Policy AP1 - A Town Plan for Appleby 
 
3.14.1 The sites AP10 and AP11 are located close to the A66 and in the case of AP10, also 
adjacent to a scrap yard. In the interest of residential  amenity the dwelling capacity of these 
two sites have been  reduced below the normal density rate to allow for the incorporation of 
noise mitigation measures. However, as only a detailed planning application would finally 
determine the site capacity, for AP10 and AP11 the capacity should be acknowledged as in 
the region of 45 and 39, respectively, taking into account the noise mitigation measures 
together with the design, form and detail of the proposal. The Town  Plan for Appleby  aims to  deliver:  
New Homes - Land  for 392  additional  new homes will be provided  in the town  during the  
plan period.  The main  locations  for housing  are South -east of Station  Road  and adjacent  
to the Coal Yard,  Station  Road  and behind  Cross  Croft.  
New Jobs - An additional  4.54 hectares  of employment  land is allocated  at Cross  Croft  
Industr ial Estate  (2.56  ha), and the redevelopment/refurbishment  of the Old Creamery  
site (1.98  ha) together  with the remaining  redevelopment  at Shire  Hall is proposed.   Land for housing is allocated on the following sites:

45 46  3.15 A Town Plan for Kirkby Stephen 
3.15.1 Kirkby Stephen is a traditional market town and is located on the A685, surrounded by the 
sparsely populated Upper Eden area. It is about 30 miles (48 km) south east of Penrith. 
The town is the natur al hub of Upper Eden, and has been relatively self-sufficient for many 
centuries. It remains an important centre for the local farming community and has a well- 
attended agricultural mart. It provides a wide range of employment in a substantial retail  
and service sector and is an educational centre, with infant and primary schooling and an 
ancient Grammar School (now a comprehensive) that is the principal secondary school in 
the Upper Eden Valley. Kirkby Stephen also has a well-equipped Upper Eden Health 
Centre providing first-line care for the whole local  community. 
3.15.2 The town stands on a low ridge that runs north-south beside the River Eden, but this ridge 
lies within a wide basin surrounded by low, undulating  hills. These screen Kirkby Stephen 
from almost a ll approaches and as a result high-quality rural scenery extends almost to its 
doorstep and little of the town is visible until the traveller actually arrives. This high-quality 
scenery is particularly evident in the east, where the slopes beyond the River Eden rise to 
the village of Hartley (itself largely hidden in a fold of the ground). Beyond, limestone scars 
climb to the moorland summits of Nine Standards Rigg. 
3.15.3 In recent years Kirkby Stephen has gained prominence as a centre for outdoor recreation, 
based largely on its proximity to the Yorkshire Dales National Park and the North Pennines 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Following the extension of the Yorkshire Dales 
National Park in August 2016, the town has designated protected landscapes around it to 
the east, south and west, and parts of the town are within the National  Park. Kirkby 
Stephen is situated near the mid-point of the Coast to Coast Walk and is also linked to 
several other long-distance trails  and cycle-ways. The hill country around provides 
excellent walking, in conditions of tranquillity arguably no longer found in the Lake District 
to the west. The limestone country nearby, including the remarkable Orton Fells-Asby Scar 
ridge, has dramatic limestone pavements and a rich wild flora making it highly attractive to 
naturalists. The town has a small hotel, a hostel  and several pubs, and many homes and 
some farms offer bed and breakfast accommodation. The nurture and expansion of this 
tourist industry is a central concern in long-term planning. 
3.15.4 There remain a number of challenges for the town. Like many small towns Kirkby Stephen 
lacks 'green spaces' within the town itself. It is ringed by high-quality countryside but lacks 
parks or pleasant open areas within the urban perimeter. Apart from private gardens, the 
churchyard is the principal  green space in the town centre. The two designated parks in 
the town are both on the outskirts. 
3.15.5 While the railway links for Kirkby Stephen are prized (and the Settle-Carlisle railway is 
growing in popularity among recreational users),  most travel in the area depends, and will 
continue to depend, on road vehicles. However, future planning must cater for an 
overwhelming dependence on privately owned road vehicles. The road network in Kirkby 
Stephen can be congeste d, with traffic flow problems in the narrow roads aggravated by 
on-street parking. It is therefore essential that all new housing and industrial development 
p
rovides realistically for the adjustment of road capacity and the provision of adequate off- 
road parking. 47  3.15.6 Finally, Kirkby Stephen is a town with many small businesses employing five or fewer 
people. Whilst both environmental and economic factors militate against Kirkby Stephen 
becoming a 'dormitory' settlement from which residents commute to distant employment, 
this makes the provision of employment in the town crucial to its future. 
 
3.16 Objectives 
3.16.1  The objectives for Kirkby Stephen are: 
 To act as a gateway to the Yorkshire Dales National  Park, particularly if the park is 
extended towards the town. This will include nurturing and expanding tourist services, 
and exploiting its position along the Coast to Coast walking and cycling routes. 
 To evolve as the economic 'hub'  of Upper Eden (recognising that Brough and Church 
Brough, too, is a substantial and important local community with considerable growth 
potential). 
 To preserve the highly valued green setting of the town. 
 The lack of green spaces and paucity of trees within the town perimeter will be 
addressed and new amenity and recreational areas will be required in new housing 
developments. 
 To provide a mix of new housing types and sizes, including affordable housing. 
 Suitable sites for small to medium scale businesses will be provided, to allow 
opportunities for career progression within the community. 
 The needs of an older, retired population will be recognised and planned for, including 
appropriate dwellings, sheltered housing and extra care for older people and suitable 
medical services. A Vision for Kirkby  Stephen  
 
Kirkby  Stephen  will continue  to prosper  as the principal settlem ent serving the Upper  
Eden  area.  New housing  and employment  development  will help meet  the needs  and 
demands  of local people,  but this will be planned  and delivered  in a way that does  not 
detract  from the  historical  and tranquil character  of the town.  
New opportunities  to support  and encourage  the tourism  sector  will be explored and  
exploited,  with the town  marketing  itself as an ideal  gateway  to the  Yorkshire  Dales  
National  Park, as  well as on  the basis  of the stunning  landscapes,  which  surround  it. 
The town will continue  to provide  support  services  to the wider  rural economy,  but will 
also recognise  that its relative  self-containment  means  that a wider  range  of jobs may be 
needed  to maintain  the local economy.  
Kirkby  Stephen  will strive  to reflect the right balance  between  meeting  the housing  and 
care needs  of an ageing population  and retaining and attracting younger  families on the 
other.  48  3.17 Policy KS1 - A Town Plan for Kirkby Stephen 
 The Town  Plan for Kirkby  Stephen  aims to deliver:  
New Homes - Land  for 305  new homes will be provided  in the town  during the plan 
period.  The main  locations  for housing will  be land to west of Faraday  Road and at land to 
the west of Nateby  Road.  
New Jobs - An additional  3.33 hectares  of employment  land is allocated  at Kirkby

3.19 Objectives 
3.19.1 The objectives for the Eden’s Rural Areas are:  
 To protect and enhance their landscape setting and historic environment.  
 To allow for sensitively designed small scale new development to help sustain 
services.  
 To encourage self-build housing as a means of allowing local  people to meet their own 
housing needs.  
 To encourage tourism as a means of sustaining the rural economy.  
 To allow for the sensitive conversion of traditional  rural  buildings to active use.  
 To devolve plan-making to local level where possible, by offering support to 
communities producing neighbourhood plans.  
3.19.2 The following policies in the chapter refer specifically to Eden’s rural areas - for the 
a
voidance of doubt this means all areas outside the four main towns of Penrith, Alston 
Appleby and Kirkby Stephen. 
3.20 Policy RUR1 – A Plan for the Key Hubs 
 The Plan for the  Key Hubs aims  to deliver:  
New Homes – Land  for 871  new homes will be provided  in the Key Hubs during  the plan 
period.  These  are Armathwaite,  Brough and Church Brough,  Culgaith,  Greystoke,  High 
and Low Hesket,  Kirkby  Thore,  Langwathby,  Lazonby,  Nenthead,  Plumpton,  Shap,  
Stainton  and Tebay.  
New Homes – An additional  2.92 hectares  of employment  land is allocated  in Brough  and

The distinctiveness  and high quality  of life that characterise  Eden’s  extensive  patchwork  
of villages  will be maintained.  New development  will be sympathetic  to its surroundings  
and fit in with the local landscape  and architecture, and land outsid e settlements  will be 
prized  and protected.  
Services  and facilities  will continue  to be supported in the rural villages.  A sense  of local 
community  and belonging will  be maintained  and reinforced,  with decisions  made  at 
community  level as far as possible.  
New opportunities  to support  and encourage  the tourism  sector  will be explored and  
exploited.  51  New housing will be developed in the Key Hubs in accordance with the following targets:

Explanation 
3.21.1 Agriculture is a fundamental part of Eden’s economy, culture and landscape. The Local  
Plan needs to support the rural economy and ensure that the right balance is struck 
between new development and the protection of the special characteristics of Eden’s rural 
landscape. The farming landscape is characterised by traditional arrangements of farm 
buildings clustered around farmhouses and courtyards, with simple building forms and 
traditional local building materials. Modern large agricultural buildings can, if not designed 
and sited sensitively, have a harmful impact on the landscape character of the rural area. 
This can happen where they are positioned in open  and obtrusive locations such as the 
crests of hills, where they have unusual and overly complex building forms, or where they 
use brightly coloured and reflective materials and colouring which make them particularly 
prominent across long distance views  across the landscape. 
3.21.2 The Eden Design Guide has been produced to provide guidance to applicants on how 
good design can be achieved across a range of development types, and will be a material  
consideration in determining planning applications. The Guide provides guidance on large- 
scale commercial and agricultural development and proposals for new agricultural 
buildings will be expected to accord with the guidelines. 
Reason for the Policy 
3.21.3  Thi s policy recognises that there will be a need  for new purpose built agricultural buildings 
over the plan period and provides a clear framework for assessing planning applications to 
e
nsure new buildings are designed and sited sensitively. New agricultural buildings  should  be integrated  into the existing farm  complex  wherever  
possible  to reflect  the traditional  clustering  of rural buildings.  Where  there is justification  
for a new farm building to be built in isolation  from existing buildi ngs, permission  will be 
granted  where  the following  criteria  have  been  met: 
 The proposal  carefully  considers topography  and landform  and how the building can 
be sited  to minimise  its visual  and landscape  impact.  
 Opportunities  have  been  taken  to retain  existing planting  and introduce  new native  
tree planting  to help screen  new buildings  where necessary.  
 The proposal  utilises  subdued  colours  to reduce  the visual  prominence  of the new 
building.  54  3.22 Policy RUR3 - Re-use of Redundant Buildings in Rural Areas 
The re-use of redundant traditional  rural  buildings and structures for housing, 
employment, tourism (including holiday accommodation), recreation and community uses 
will be supported in rural  areas where it meets each of the following criteria: 
 The building is capable of conversion without the need for extension, significant 
alteration or full reconstruction. 
 It can be demonstrated that the building is of sufficient architectural quality to make 
it worthy of retention. 
 The proposal is of a high quality design, retaining the design, materials and 
external features that contribute positively to the character of the building and its 
surroundings. 
 The building and its curtilage can be developed without having an adverse effect 
on the historic environment, the character of the local landscape or its setting. 
 It can be demonstrated that there is no  significant impact on local  biodiversity, 
including protected habitats and species. 
 The building can be serviced by existing utilities, or where the provision of new 
utilities is necessary, such provision can be achieved without resulting in 
unacceptable adverse impacts on the landscape or rural character  of the area. 
 The building is adjacent to or in close proximity to an existing habitable dwelling 
and the public road network, or where this is not the case and the conversion of 
such a building is justified, the building is capable of being converted without 
causing adverse harm to the landscape or rural character of the area. 
 Access is in place or can be created without damaging the surrounding area’s rural 
character. 
 The proposal will not conflict with existing land uses. 
When granting planning permission for any development under this policy the Council will 
remove permitted development rights where appropriate. This would normally apply to the 
building and its curtilage. 
 
Explanation 
3.22.1 The primary purpose of this policy is to maintain and protect the character and landscape 
of Eden’s rural  areas whilst recognising that there may be occasions where the sensitive 
conversion of traditional rural  buildings may result in either  bringing a new building back 
into use or the conversion to a more suitable use. 
3.22.2  Not all buildings in rural areas will be suitable for conversion or adaptation to new uses, 
perhaps due to their unsuitable or unsustainable location. The test is whether a p roposal 
will restore a traditional building back to its original form and design, and whether the 
building is in close proximity to an existing habitable dwelling, defined as within easy 
walking distance. 
3.22.3 The definition of ‘traditional’ refers to all types of buildings and applies where a building is 
capable of conversion without the need for substantial rebuilding and where a building is 55  capable of conversion without changes to its original  form and design, to the roofline or 
without significant extension, including for car parking spaces. Modern purpose built 
agricultural buildings, including steel framed construction buildings do not fall in to this 
definition of ‘traditional’. The policy also applies to the curtilage of the building and requires 
the removal of any permitted development rights to avoid any unsympathetic ancillary 
development, which could impact on the character  and landscape of the area. 
3.22.4  This policy is likely to apply to single dwelling or small scale schemes which will fall under 
th
e thresholds above which a contribution to affordable housing will be sought. However, 
in the event larger suitable schemes  come forward under this policy will not be expected 
to provide any contributions towards affordable housing, or meet affordability criteria, in 
recognition of the costs of sensitively reusing existing buildings. 
3.22.5  Any planning application for re-use of traditional buildings should be made in full and 
supported by full internal  and external details together with a structural  engineer’s report to 
confirm the structural integrity of the building, the means of access and drainage. 
3.22.6 The Government announced a series of amendments to what are known as ‘permitted 
development rights’ where planning permission is not required to change the use of a 
building. Since June 2013 agricultural buildings under 500 square metres can change to a 
number of other  uses (retail, office, warehousing, hotels and guest houses and leisure 
uses) without permission being needed. For buildings between 150 square metres and 
500 square metres, prior approval  from the Council (covering flooding, highways and 
transport impacts, and noise) is required. In April 2014 further rights were introduced 
which allow the change of use and some associated physical works from buildings used 
for agricultural purposes to residential use (C3). This  also involves a ‘prior approval’ 
process to allow a local planning authority to consider impacts of the proposed change. 
Further information is available on the Council’s website. This policy is therefore intended 
to apply to larger schemes or conversion from non-agricultural uses. 
3.22.7 These new permitted development rights for the conversion of an agricultural building to a 
dwelling do not apply to listed buildings, or buildings, which are located within a 
conservation area or within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The 
permitted developm ent rights also exclude sites, which are, or form part of a Site of 
Special Scientific Interest, a safety hazard area or a military explosives storage area. 
Sites, which are, or contain a scheduled monument are also excluded from these rights. 
Where these exclusions apply, an application for planning permission will be required, 
alongside any other associated consent, which may be required. 
Reason for this policy 
3.22.8 The Council has to strike a balance between restricting new development in rural areas 
and supporting village services and employment opportunities. The policy aims to take 
account of paragraph 55 of the National Planning Policy Framework and translates it into 
local development plan policy. 56  3.23 Policy RUR4 - Employment Development and Farm Diversification in Rural Areas 
Employment developments of an appropriate scale (including new build and live/work 
units) will be supported in rural areas where they meet the following criteria: 
 Wherever  possible they involve the re-use of suitable redundant traditional rural 
buildings. 
 Help towards the diversification of the rural economy. 
 Do not have a significant transport impact. 
 Are of a scale and type sympathetic to the area within which they are proposed. 
 Would respect and reinforce local landscape character, the historic environment 
and not cause harm to the natural environment, through the use of good  design. 
Diversification of activities on existing farm units will be permitted provided: 
 They will help sustain an existing farm business. 
 They are of a scale which is consistent to the location of the farm holding. 
They would not prejudice the agricultural use of the unit 
Explanation 
3.23.1  Whilst new development will be expected to comply with the locational  strategy set out in 
Policy LS1 there remains a need  to strengthen the economy of rural  areas and provide 
diversity in the local economic base. Many factors can influence the sustainability of the 
rural economy, including the scale, location and type of housing, employment 
development and environmental  considerations. A careful balance needs to be achieved 
in supporting proposals that assist the economic sustainability of local  communities, whilst 
addressing any potential environmental consequences. This policy therefore aims to be 
supportive of n ew employment development in rural areas (including on farms) whilst 
putting in place safeguards to ensure that any schemes that come forward are sensitive to 
their location. 
Reason for the Policy 
3.23.2  Whilst the main towns will be the preferred locations  for new development, there is a need 
to strengthen the economy in the rural areas and provide diversity in the local economic 
base. 57  How Will We Implement Policies in Our Planning Strategy?

4.1 Development Principles 
4.1.1 This section sets out policies on the general principles for guiding new development that 
will come forward in the district. 
4.2 Policy DEV1 - General Approach to New Development 
 
Explanation 
4.2.1 This policy sets out the general considerations that will apply when considering new 
applications for new development, and is included to help guide applicants on some of 
the key issues, which will need to be addressed. More detailed policies on water, air 
quality, transport and design are included elsewhere in this plan. 
4.2.2 The policy contains a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’, in accordance 
with the National  Planning Policy Framework. The Council will always work with 
applicants jointly to find solutions which mean that proposals can be approved wherever 
possible, and to secure development that improves the economic, social and 
environmental conditions  in the area that underpin the health and well being of 
communities. 
4.2.3 When considering large-scale development (defined in this case as having a significant 
enough impact to trigger the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment) the 
Council may require the carrying out of an agricultural land classification survey as part 
of that assessment. 
4.2.4 In respect of land stability issues, as a consequence of past mining activity, The Coal 
Authority is a statutory consultee on all planning applications, with the exception of those 
identified on their defined exemptions list, within the defined Development High Risk 
Areas. Where land falls within these areas, development proposals must be supported by When  considering  development  proposals  the Council will  take a  positive  approach  that 
reflects the presumption  in favour  of sustainable  development  contained  in the National  
Planning  Policy  Framework.  It will always  work  proactively with  applicants to find 
solutions  which  mean  that proposals  can be approved  wherever  possible, and to secure  
development  that improves  economic, social  and environmental  conditions  in the area.  
Planning  applications  that accord  with policies  in this  Local  Plan (and,  where  relevant,  
with policies in neighbourhood  plans)  will be approved  withou t delay,  unless material  
considerations  indicate  otherwise.  
Where  there  are no policies  relevant  to the application  or relevant  policies  are out of date 
at the time of making  the decision  then the Council will  grant permissions  unless  material  
consideratio ns indicate  otherwise  – taking  into account  whether:  
 Any adverse  impacts  of granting  permission  would  significantly  and demonstrably  
outweigh  the benefits,  when  assessed  against  the policies in  the National  Planning  
Policy  Framework  taken  as a whole;  or 
 Specific  policies  in that Framework  indicate  that development  should  be restricted.  61  a Coal Mining Risk Assessment, or equivalent, in order to identify any potential risks to 
the new development and any required remediation measures. These assessments must 
be carried out by a suitably qualified person to the current British Standards and 
approved guidance. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.2.5 With regar ds to the presumption in favour of sustainable development a variation of this 
policy has been put forward by Central Government and the Planning Inspectorate to be 
included in future plans, and is considered necessary for a plan to be found ‘sound’ at 
Examination. The policy also aims to guide potential developers as to some of the key 
issues that will be considered when assessing applications for development. 
4.3 Policy DEV2 - Water Management and Flood Risk 
New development must be in a location which meets each of the following criteria: 
 Avoids risks  to the water supply, or includes sufficient mitigation measures to ensure 
that there is no risk to water supply. 
 Would not compromise the effectiveness of existing flood defences. 
 Meets the sequential approach to development in flood risk areas. Inappropriate 
development will not be permitted in flood zones 2 and 3, critical drainage areas or 
areas which have a history of groundwater flooding, or where it would increase flood 
risk elsewhere unless there is an overriding need and a clear absence of a suitable 
alternative site. If sites, as an exception, need to be developed in areas at risk  of 
flooding, suitable flood protection measures will be required. Major development, 
defined in Appendix 2, should be informed by a flood risk assessment. 
New development must incorporate Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), where 
practicable, to manage surface water run-off. All applications for major development, 
defined in Appendix 2, will be subject to review by the Lead Local Flood Authority. 
Surface water should be discharged in the following order of priority: 
1. To an adequate soakaway or some other form of infiltration system 
2. By an attenuated discharge to a watercourse 
3. By an attenuated discharge to a public surface water sew er 
4. By an attenuated discharge to a public combined sewer 
Applicants will need to submit clear evidence demonstrating why there is no alternative 
option but to discharge surface water to the public sewerage system and that the 
additional discharge can be accommodated. The presumption will be against the 
discharge of surface water to the public sewerage network. 62  Explanation 
4.3.1 This policy covers risks to water supply and from flooding. A separate policy on water 
quality is set out in Section 4 (Policy ENV9). While development in areas at some risk of 
flooding may sometimes be unavoidable (for example in some parts of Penrith and 
Appleby) the policy approach requires mitigation measures in such circumstances so that 
there is no increase in risk. 
4.3.2 The use of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) to manage surface water flows can be 
an important tool in minimising flood risk. SuDS can also assist pollution control  (through 
improved filtration) and habitat creation within new developments. The Flood and Water 
Management Act (2010) introduced a requirement for developers to submit SuDS plans for 
the local management of run-off water in major development for approval by Sustainable 
Urban Drainage Approval Boards (SABs), which must adopt the systems after construction. 
In April 2015 regulations were put in place to implement the requirements of the act and 
Cumbria County Council now acts as the Lead Local Flood Authority. Schemes of ten or 
more homes (in the case of residential  development) will be expected to incorporate SuDS. 
4.3.3 Surface water should be managed at source and not transferred. On greenfield sites 
applicants will be expected to demonstrate that the current natural drainage solution from a 
site is at least mimicked. A discharge to groundwater or the watercourse may require 
consent from the Environment Agency. Applicants wishing to discharge to a public sewer 
will need to submit clear evidence demonstrating that alternative options are not available. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.3.4 This  policy aims to put in place safeguards to ensure new development will not compromise 
existing water supply or flood defences, and avoid development which would be at risk from 
flooding or increase flood risk outside the site. 63  4.4 Policy DEV3 - Transport, Accessibility and Rights of Way 
New development will be encouraged in areas with existing public transport availability, or 
in areas where new development is likely to lead to the creation of available public 
transport. Developments likely to generate severe adverse travel impacts will not be 
permitted where they are in isolated or difficult to access locations unless  an 
overwhelming environmental, social or economic need can be demonstrated. 
Development will be refused if it will result in a severe impact in terms of road safety and 
increased traffic congestion. Development should provide safe and convenient access for 
pedestrians, cyclists and disabled people. 
Proposals will be expected to adhere to guidance and standards issued by the Highways 
Authority on the number of parking spaces to be provid ed (including for the disabled and 
for bicycles). 
Applications for major development (defined in Appendix 2), will be expected to be 
accompanied by a Travel Plan and/or a Transport Assessment showing all the following 
criteria: 
 How the site will be safely connected to  public transport. 
 How the site will meet the needs and safety concerns of pedestrians and cyclists. 
 How the impact of any heavy goods vehicles accessing the site will be minimised, 
including during the construction phase. 
 The impact of the development on the local highway network. 
 How the site will ensure the permeability and accessibility of the area. 
 How the site safely and conveniently links to main attractors (such as schools, retail 
and employment uses). 
Development will not be supported where it meets any of the following criteria, individually 
or cumulatively in combination with other development proposals: 
 It would prevent the future opening of any road or rail schemes under consideration. 
 It would remove an existing right of way, unless there is no alternative suitable 
location and the benefits from the development would justify the loss, or where an 
acceptable diversion is provided and a legal  diversion order obtained. 
 It would lead to a material increase or significant change in the character  of traffic 
(vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders and animals) using a rail crossing, 
unless it can be demonstrated that safety will not be compromised, in consultation 
with Network Rail.  
 Evidence shows that there would be a severe, unmitigated impact of the surrounding 
highway network . 64  Explanation 
4.4.1 This policy is included to help deal with any potential impacts from additional transport 
generated by new development, and sets out how the Council will deal with any planning 
applications when it comes to transport implications. Within Eden, the Cumbria Local 
Transport Plan (LTP) is the main document covering transportation policy. The LTP 
provides a vision and strategy for integrated transport in the county. 
4.4.2 Development will be required to support the aims  of the Cumbria Local Transport Plan, 
which are: 
 A strong sustainable local economy. 
 Lower carbon emissions. 
 Supporting local communities. 
 Reducing the need  to travel. 
 Better sustainable access to jobs and services in rural areas. 
 Improved publ ic health. 
 A high quality natural and built environment. 
4.4.3 The key priority for transport in Eden is to strengthen the role of Penrith as a service 
centre, supporting housing and employment growth. A key employment area is at Gilwilly 
to the north of Penrith. The priority in the rural  areas will be to improve access to jobs and 
services, through working closely with local communities. 
4.4.4 It is recommended that applicants consult the guidance provided in the Cumbria 
Development Design Guide when producing a Transport Assessment or Travel Plan. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.4.5 The Council has a limited direct role in transport provision but it has an important role in 
ensuring that development takes place in locations that are accessible by a range of 
modes of transport, thereby promoting more sustainable travel. Accessibility is very 
important in a rural area where services and facilities are often far from where people live. 
It has to be recognised that for large parts of the District the private car will remain the 
primary mode of transport until public /community transport becomes a practical  or 
economically viable alternative. 65  4.5 Policy DEV4 - Infrastructure and Implementation 
The scale and pace of new development will be dependent upon sufficient capacity being 
available in the existing infrastructure networks to meet the demands of new 
development. Where this cannot be demonstrated, permission for new development will 
only be granted where additional  capacity can be released through better management of 
existing infrastructure, through the provision of new infrastructure, or in the case of 
transport infrastructure, where it can be demonstrated through the use of a Transport 
Statement or Transport Assessments that the residual cumulative impacts of the 
development will not be severe. 
Developer contributions may be sought to fund new infrastructure and a programme of 
delivery will be agreed before development can take place. Contributions must be 
necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms and ensure the viability 
of development is maintained. 
In some cases developer contributions will take the form of a financial contribution. In all 
cases they will be directly, fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the proposed 
development. Infrastructure requirements are set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. 
The ability of a developer to pay contributions, based on an assessment of the economic 
viability of the development will be considered at the application stage. Negotiations 
between developers and the Council (advised where appropriate by Cumbria County 
Council) will determine on a case by case basis whether a developer can feasibly pay 
contributions to infrastructure without undermining the scheme’s viability. 
The need for a Community Infrastructure Levy will be reviewed periodically by the 
Council. 
Explanation 
4.5.1 It is essential that new development is supported by the infrastructure it needs to function, 
and that new development does not increase pressure on existing infrastructure. Where 
new development will require new infrastructure the Council  can require that the developer 
and/or landowner contribute, as long as such requirements do not render the scheme 
unviable. This is known as ‘planning gain’, with the contributions funded by the uplift in land 
values resulting from the grant of planning permission. Planning obligations will be sought 
when they are necessary to make a development acceptable that would otherwise be 
unacceptable in planning terms. They can be in the form of compensation or mitigation for 
the effects of the development on the site or surrounding area, or they can be agreements 
where the developer agrees to carry out development in a certain way. On larger sites it 
may be necessary to ensure that the delivery of development is phased in such a way to 
co-ordinate the installation of new infrastructure, and a programme of delivery may need to 
be agreed. 
4.5.2 The Council may in the future introduce a ‘Community Infrastructure Levy’ which would 
apply a flat rate contribution for infrastructure for larger developments. In the meantime 
contributions will be secured through the use of planning obligations. Cumbria County 66  Council have also produced and adopted a document covering the planning obligations, 
which may be sought to support  their functions. 
4.5.3 A separate infrastructure delivery plan has been  prepared which will set out the scale, 
timing and delivery arrangements associated with the level and type of development 
anticipated to come forward before 2032. 
4.5.4 Supporting infrastructure is defined as: 
Essential infrastructure for all new development 
 Adequate highway access and capacity 
 Primary and secondary school placements 
 Clean water supply 
 Adequate wastewater capacity 
 Sustainable drainage systems

4.5.5 The above list is not necessarily exhaustive. In some cases developer contributions will 
take the form of a financial contribution. In all cases they will be directly, fairly and 
reasonably related in scale and kind to the propos ed development. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.5.6 To make sure associated infrastructure needs are provided for in all new development and 
make clear that contributions may be sought from developers to fund any additional 
infrastructure needs arising from new development. 68  4.6 Policy DEV5 - Design of New Development 
The Council will support high quality design, which reflects local distinctiveness. All 
development proposals will be expected to perform highly when assessed against best 
practice guidance and standards for design, sustainability, and place making. 
New development will be required to demonstrate that it meets each of the following 
criteria: 
 Shows a clear understanding of the form and character of the district’s built and 
natural environment, complementing and enhancing  the existing area. 
 Protects and where possible enhances the district’s distinctive rural landscape, 
natural environment and biodiversity. 
 Reflects the existing street scene through use of appropriate scale, mass, form, 
layout, high quality architectural design and use of materials. 
 Optimises the potential use of the site and avoids overlooking. 
 Protects the amenity of existing residents and business occupiers and provides an 
acceptable amenity for future occupiers. 
 Uses quality materials which complement or enhance local surroundings 
 Protects features and characteristics of local importance. 
 Provides adequate space for the storage, collection and recycling of waste. 
 Can be easily accessed and used by all, regardless of age and disability. 
 Incorporates appropriate crime prevention measures. 
Proposals will be expected to demonstrate that they adhere to the design principles set 
out in the Eden Design Guide. 
Explanation 
4.6.1 Eden’s local built distinctiveness arises directly from its  long tradition of vernacular 
architecture that continues to exert a strong influence on modern development. As the 
district has not been subject to large scale building pressures development has tended to 
be incremental and a large amount of pre-1919 property remains. The use of local 
materials is widespread and this gives variety within the overall common built form. 
4.6.2 Although some locations contain a mix of styles, there are three main character  areas in 
Eden based on the underlying geology: 
 Eden Valley with its typical red sandstone, dressed quoins and window surrounds. 
 Westmorland Fells area which uses local limestone as its prevalent building material. 
Random rubble walls are frequently rendered or lime washed. In common with the 
Eden Valley, Westmorland and Burlington slates are the typical roofing material. 69   North Pennines characterised by local honey coloured millstone grit. This local 
building material is used both in random rubble and dressed ashlar for quoins and 
surrounds. External staircases are a local feature and the traditional  roofing material 
is thick yellow sandstone slates. 
4.6.3 Eden’s built tradition is also closely allied with its landscape setting particularly outside of 
Penrith. Barns, enclosures and stone walls are typically all built of the same underlying 
local stone. This gives a cohesive harmony creating a seamless fit between the built and 
natural landscapes. 
4.6.4 This results  in the district’s many interesting buildings, diverse street patterns and 
individual spaces resulting in fine townscape qualities and means that one of the 
challenges for new development is that it must respect local vernacular architectural styles  
and spaces whilst providing distinctive and popular modern buildings that can endure into 
the future. Good relationships with existing development and the use of public  art and 
landscaping can all help to further develop local identity and places that people are proud 
of. 
4.6.5 All new developments should therefore aspire to the highest standards of design, including 
construction methods and materials, and these issues should be integrated into the 
development process at an early stage, along with consideration of community safety, 
residential amenity and sustainable access. There are several sources of design and 
landscape guidance available, which the Council will expect new development to comply 
with. These are: 
 The Eden Design Guide. 
 In the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the North Pennines 
AONB Design Guide. 
 Cumbria Landscape Character Guidance and Toolkit. 
 Within Eden’s twenty four Conservation Areas (of which six are within the Yorkshire 
Dales National Park), their accompanying appraisals where available. 
4.6.6 Providing a safe environment and incorporating appropriate crime prevention measures is 
an important element of a high quality design. Enabling opportunities for natural 
surveillance is essential and may be provided in a number of ways, for example, through 
the avoidance of blank frontages; the positioning of doors and windows  so as to overlook 
public spaces; a mix of uses that encourage activity throughout the day; the minimisation 
of visual obstacles; and the use of CCTV. Rear gardens should normally be avoided 
adjacent to public spaces, because they provide no casual  surveillance. Places of 
concealment need  to be avoided, for examp le through the careful siting and design of 
buildings and landscaping, and use of lighting, Consideration should also be given to the 
need to install intruder alarm equipment in buildings and park vehicles and bikes in a 
secure space. 70  Reason for this poli cy 
4.6.7 To encourage good  design, respect for the existing character of the built environment and 
the creation of new development that proves to be a long-term asset to the area in which it 
is located. 71  How Will We Implement These Policies?

4.7.1 This section sets out additional  policies that will be taken into account when looking at 
planning applications for new housing development. Policies relating to the amount and 
distribution of new housing are contained in Part 3 of this plan (A Planning Strategy for 
Eden District). Policies set out earlier in this Local  Plan covering the general principles for 
new housing are also relevant. 
4.8 Policy HS1 - Affordable Housing 
The Council will seek to secure the provision of 30% of all new housing as affordable 
homes on schemes with 11 or more units, or more than 1,000 square metres of floor 
space. Where the on-site contribution does not equate precisely to a whole number of 
units, the contribution will be rounded down to the nearest unit. Size, type and tenure of 
affordable housing will be negotiated on a site- by-site basis based upon the most up to 
date evidence of housing need. 
In Penrith no contributions will be required on sites of 10 units or less, and with no more 
than 1,000 square metres of floor space. 
In the three Market Towns (Alston, Appleby and Kirkby Stephen), the Key Hubs and the 
Smaller Villages and Hamlets a commuted sum will be required from sites with 6 to 10 
units. This will be secured by means of a planning obligation. 
In Other Rural Areas (outside the Key Hubs and Smaller Villages and Hamlets), new 
housing will be restricted to affordable housin g, in an existing settlement comprised of a 
coherent group of three or more dwellings. 
Where it can be demonstrated that application of the policy will render any housing 
scheme unviable, fewer affordable homes than required by this policy will be acceptab le if 
a financial appraisal provides evidence to justify any reduced provision. This may include 
potentially higher costs associated with the development of previously developed land. 
Planning permission will be linked to an agreement that any affordable housing delivered 
will remain affordable in perpetuity and occupancy will be restricted to those in the locality 
as defined in Appendix 5 – Local Connection Criteria for Affordable Housing. 
Explanation 
4.8.1 House prices in Eden are amongst the highest in Cumbria. The median house price in 
Eden in 2014 was £192,822, with the median household income in Eden in 2014 only 
£26,3337. This means house prices are 7.3 times the average household income; making 
the private housing market inaccessible to many local people. This is particularly an issue 
for the young, who can end up inadequately housed or moving out of the area. This policy 
therefore ensures that a proportion of new housing delivered in Eden will be delivered as 
 
7 © CACI Paycheck Data, 2014  74  ‘affordable housing’, with any subsidy or discount from the developer or landowner taken 
from the uplift in land values arising from the grant of planning permission. 
4.8.2 Affordable housing is housing delivered with some form of subsidy to help meet the 
housing needs of people who are otherwise unable to meet their needs on the open  
market. To qualify as affordable housing new homes should meet the needs of eligible 
households at a cost low enough for them to afford, and it should remain at an affordable 
price for future eligible households or, if these restrictions  are lifted, for the subsidy to be 
recycled for alternative affordable housing provision. 
4.8.3 The type of affordable housing will be dependent on local needs, but can be for social  
rent, affordable rent or intermediate (discounted) sale or rent. Social rented housing is 
rented housing owned and managed by local authorities and registered social landlords, 
for which guideline target rents are determined through the national rent regime. 
Intermediate affordable housing is housing at prices and rents above those of social rent, 
but below market price or rents, and which meet the criteria set out above. Models of 
intermediate housing include shared equity, shared ownership affordable rental  or 
discounted sale. ‘Low cost’ mark et housing and housing provided at discount by a 
developer at first occupation with no further provision to ensure that the property remains 
affordable to subsequent occupiers or for any subsidy to be recycled will not be classed as 
affordable housing. The Council’s initial preference for the mix of affordable units on-site is 
for 70% affordable rented units and 30% intermediate units. However there will be 
flexibility around this and the Housing Team will advise on a case- by-case basis. Further 
information on our approach to affordable housing provision is set out in our Housing 
Supplementary Planning Document. 
4.8.4 Where affordable housing is provided at discounted market value, a discount of 40% will 
be applied. 
4.8.5 It is important that those in need  in the distri ct benefit from more affordable housing in the 
district, and to this end the Council is keen that the maximum number of affordable 
dwellings is delivered from the new housing development that will take place over the 
period of the plan. It is, however, equally important to make sure that the Council does not 
request a level of affordable housing contributions from developers that renders schemes 
unviable and stymies development, resulting in no market or affordable housing coming 
forward. A degree of flexibility will be applied where it can be shown that contributions risk 
rendering schemes unviable. 
4.8.6 We have also commissioned work on viability that will be updated as the plan moves 
towards adoption. The Council has commissioned a district wide Economic Viabi lity 
Assessment to assess a reasonable affordable housing contribution, to update work last 
carried out in 2013. The current evidence suggested that a 30% affordable requirement 
would be viable in many cases. This evidence showed that for three of the ‘stu dy areas’, 
other than Alston Moor, for greenfield sites of low, medium and high densities with low 
developer contribution requirements sites remained viable with a 30% contribution. For 
smaller sites viability was also maintained when higher contributions were sought. This 
evidence will be used to carry out a wider study of the cumulative impacts of all 
contributions sought from developers. 75  4.8.7 Affordable housing delivered through this policy will be restricted to only those meeting the 
local occupancy criteria set out in Appendix 5. 
4.8.8 This policy applies to all residential development except for hostels, residential care and 
nursing homes (not including Extra Care schemes) and educational establishments which 
include an element of residential  accommodation which is directly linked to educational 
facilities on site. 
4.8.9 Where an applicant considers that there are significant economic constraints affecting a 
development and that these are sufficient to jeopardise the applicant meeting the 
Council’s affordable housing policy expectations, or where the applicant believes the 
Council’s affordable housing requirement will render  a site unviable, then the developer 
will need to provide a site based economic viability assessment (a residual land valuation 
calculation), and associated information to enable the Council to assess the nature, extent 
and impact of the economic constraints. 
4.8.10 In the three Market Towns, the Key Hubs and the Smaller Villages and Hamlets small 
developments (that is,  below the threshold of 11 units) will not be expected to provide an 
affordable housing component, but a financial contribution in lieu will be sought for 
between 6 and 10 dwellings. The Housing Supplementary Planning Document will provide 
further details. 
4.8.11 Where it can be demonstrated that an element of market housing is needed to help cross 
subsidise an element of affordable housing to meet a local need in the Smaller Villages 
and Hamlets listed in Policy LS1 this will be restricted to infilling and rounding off 
development, under the terms of Policy LS1. 76  Reason for this policy 
4.8.12 House prices in Eden are amongst the highest in Cumbria and local people, especially 
younger people, often find themselves priced out of the market. In the rural areas of Eden, 
the need is made worse by the high demand f or second homes, retirement homes and 
holiday lets. 
4.8.13 Planning policies have an important role in helping to deliver low cost homes through 
quotas of affordable dwellings being negotiated on market housing sites. Where a relevant 
local need  has been  identified, the Council, through legal agreements with developers, 
seeks to secure a proportion of affordable homes for local people and to keep these 
affordable indefinitely. 
4.9 Policy HS2 - Housing in the Smaller Villages and Hamlets 
 
Explanation 
4.9.1 This policy aims to encourage people to meet their own housing needs locally, particularly 
through self-build. Self-build refers to the mechanism through which housing is built, and in 
planning terms there is no difference between self-build and open  market housing in terms 
of the end product. The part  planning can play is in its approach to the provision of new 
dwellings in rural areas. 
4.9.2 The Council wishes to support those in rural areas who wish to build or commission their 
own home where they have a strong local connection, as this can help meet local  housing 
aspirations and sustain villages. However, it does not want to see unfettered market 
development that would not support local housing aspirations. This policy is therefore aimed 
at providing a ‘middle way’ for those with strong local connections who either cannot afford 
or find an open market house in their own locality and are not considered as being in 
affordable housing need, whilst also putting in place protections to prevent new houses 
ending up as second homes. A wider set of local connection criteria are applied than those Within  the Smaller  Villages  and Hamlets  listed  in Policy  LS1, permission  will be given  for 
housing  of an appropriate  scale,  which  reflects  the built form of adjoining and 
neighbouring  development  to the site and the service  function  of the settlement,  
(including sub -division  of existing housing) where  it meets  all of the following criteria:  
 Where  development  is restricted  to infilling  and rounding off  of the current  village  
settlement  pattern,  in accordance  with Policy  LS1. 
 The resultant  dwelling  does  not contain  more  than 150m2 gross  internal  floorspace.  
 In the case  of Greenfield  sites a  condition or legal agreement  restricting  occupancy  to 
only those  meeting  local connection  criteria,  defined  in Appendix  6, will be applied.  
Local  occupancy  restrictions  will not be  applied  where  suitable  housing comes  forward  on 
previously  developed  land.  This is in recognition  of the higher  costs  involved  in 
developing such sites and the oppo rtunities  they may bring  to help improve  the character  
and appearance  of villages  and to support  local services.  77  for affordable housing to encourage housing to come forward through this policy. The 
criteria can be found in Appendix 6. 
4.9.3 No legal agreement will be applied to cap the value of the house at a price where it would 
be considered ‘affordable’ under the definition of affordable housing in Policy HS1 (as is the 
case with current policy). This is to both encourage take up of this policy and aid the 
provision of mortgages to support schemes. However, it should be noted by prospective 
applicants that whilst housing built via this policy is not considered ‘affordable’ under current 
definitions the resultant housing is likely to be lower than market value as the imposition of a 
legal agreement or condition restricting occupancy reduces demand, and therefore the 
eventual selling price. This can be reflected in the amount paid for land if land is not already 
in the applicant’s ownership. 
4.9.4 Planning permission will not be given for open market housing which will not be occupied by 
those with local connections unless it helps cross  subsidise the provision of affordable units. 
Whilst it is a potential option for developers to construct new housing with the aim of selling 
it on to someone locally we would anticipate that most new housing in the smaller villages 
would come forward in the form of self-build units. 
4.9.5 More information on self-build housing is available through the National Self-Build 
Association’s internet Self-Build Portal. Local connection criteria are set out at Appendix 6. 
Reason for this policy 
4.9.6 To encourage the innovative methods of providing housing to meet local needs and help 
support smaller villages in the district. This includes additional provision of housing for those 
with a local connection only. 
4.10 Policy HS3 - Essential Dwellings for Workers in the Countryside 
Permission for the development of a dwelling needed to support an agricultural or rural 
business will be permitted in exceptional circumstances. The circumstances are: 
 Where it is to be occupied by a full time farm or rural worker with a demonstrable 
need for a dwelling in that particular locality, or for a dwelling required in association 
with a rural enterprise, and this need can be substantiated. 
 Where the agricultural or rural business is profitable and has been  in operation for at 
least three years and can financially support the construction of the dwelling. 
 The dwelling is limited to a size of 150m2 internal floorspace (gross), unless it can be 
demonstrated that a larger dwelling is needed to support  the farm enterprise.  
 Where the scale of the dwelling is commensurate with the function of the enterprise 
concerned. 
 Where the siting and design of the dwelling is well related to existing buildings and 
the design respects and complements local  tradition and setting. 
 Where development will not have any significant impacts on local landscape, 
archaeological or conservation interests. 78  Explanation 
4.10.1  This policy aims to allow for the exceptional development of housing to support agricultural 
and rural businesses. Existing planning policy restricts new development outside of 
settlements and this policy aims to anticipate circumstances where a dwelling may be 
necessary to ensure the proper running of a farm or business. Where existing suitable 
buildings are available these should be used in preference to any new development. 
Reason for this policy 
4.10.2 This policy will put into place policy guidance from paragraph 55 of the National Planning 
Policy Framework which states that special circumstances may exist which justify isolated 
new homes in the countryside, such as an essential need  for a rural worker to live 
permanently at or near their workplace. 
4.11 Policy HS4 - Housing Type and Mix 
 
Explanation 
4.11.1 The Council will work with developers  to make sure new housing delivery reflects the 
needs and demands of everyone in the district. It is expected that on larger sites a mix of 
types and sizes of dwellings will be provided to meet a range of needs and demands. The 
information contained in the Council’s 2015 Strategic Housing Market Assessment will be 
used to support this aim. 
Reason for this policy 
4.11.2 This policy is intended to establish the principle that the local authority will seek a range of 
housing from develope rs which evidence suggests will meet the needs and aspirations of 
the local population. The mix of dwelling types and sizes  provided  in new residential  schemes  will be 
expected  to address  the nature  of local needs  as evidenced through each  of the 
following criteria:  
 Any up to  date local housing needs  surveys  and local housing market  assessments.  
 Any other local housing  needs information  (e.g. relating  to elderly  people  or special  
needs).  
 The location  and characteristics  of the site. 
 The type and mix of housing in the  locality,  including housing  age, condition  and 
occupancy.  
 Current  housing market  conditions  and viability.  79  4.12 Policy HS5 – Accessible and Adaptable Homes 
 
Explanation 
4.12.1 As a result of the national  housing standards review the Government has amended the 
building regulations and has enabled local authorities to set ‘optional’ building regulations 
requirements where there is local justification. One of these optional requirements relates 
to the enhanced accessibility and adaptability of dwellings. Eden Council has decided to 
apply the optional requirement M4(2): Category 2 – Accessible and adaptable dwellings. 
The requirement will be secured through a planning condition on permitted schemes. 
Reason for this policy 
4.12.2 Eden’s population is ageing and over the life of the Local  Plan the number of people aged 
over 65 is set to grow by over 40%, meaning that by 2032 more than a third of our 
population will be over 65. The number of households where the household representative 
is over 85 is set to double in the same period. It is therefore important that the Local Plan 
takes a positive approach to planning ahead for the housing issues that will arise from an 
ageing population. 
4.12.3 Policy HS5 recognises that people’s needs change over their lifetimes due to ageing or 
disability/illness. As people’s  needs change, having an adaptable and accessible home 
means that they will be able to choose for themselves whether to stay in their own home, 
rather than being forced to move if it becomes unsuitable. Policy HS5 seeks to ensure that 
an appropriate proportion of new housing in Eden is built to a standard that means it is  
more accessible and can be more easily adapted to suit its occupants’ needs over time. New housing  must  be designed  and constructed  in a way that enables  it to be adapted  
to meet  the changing needs  of its occupants  over time.  
For this reason  the Council will  require  20% of new housing  on sites of 10 or more  new 
homes  to meet  the optional  Building Regulations  Requirement  M4(2):  Category  2 – 
Accessible  and Adaptable  Dwellings.  
New development  will only be exempt  from the requirement  where  it can be 
demonstrated  by the applicant  that it is not practically  achievable  or financially  viable  to 
deliver  this policy.  
Within  Penrith,  Alston,  Appleby  and Kirkby  Stephen  and the Key Hubs,  applications  for 
developm ent specifically  for older  people  or groups  who require  supported housing will 
be supported.  80  4.13 Policy HS6 - Community Land Trusts 
 
Explanation 
4.13.1 A Community Land Trust8 is a not-for-profit corporate body, which is established to acquire 
and manage land and other assets for the benefit to the local community. They are set up 
to ensure that the assets are not sold or developed except in a manner which the Trust's 
members think benefits the local  community, and to ensure that any profits from its 
activities will be used to benefit the local community. Individuals who live or work in the 
area have the opportunity to become members of the trust. A Community Land  Trust 
already operates in Crosby Ravensworth. 
Reason for this policy 
4.13.2  To encourage the innovative methods of providing affordable housing in rural areas. 
 
8 A legal definition is provided in Section 79 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 Applications  for development  of sites bought  forward  by a Community  Land  Trust will be 
supported,  provided  that: 
 The location  accords with the locational  strategy  set out  in policy  LS1. 
 The scheme  incorporates  a range  of dwelling  sizes,  types  and tenures  
appropriate  to identified  local need.  
 The scheme  has general  community  support,  with evidence  of meaningful  public  
engagement.  
An element  of open  market  housing  on the site will be acceptable  where it is  
demonstrated  through  a financial appraisal  that it is essential  to enable  the delivery  of 
affordable  housing or other  community  benefits  on-site, and the community  benefits  of 
the scheme  are significantly  greater than would  be delivered  on an equivalent  open  
market  site. 81  4.14 Poli cy HS7 - Gypsy and Traveller Sites

4.14.2 The Council has worked jointly with Cumbria County Council and the other districts to 
assess the needs of Gypsies and Travellers in terms of both static and transient sites 
(Cumbria Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Needs Assessment, 2013). The current 
anticipated need  for residential pitches for Gypsies and Travellers is an additional  nine 
pitches by 2018. Beyond 2018 and to the end of the plan period it is anticipated that a 
further 18 or so units may be required to meet identified need. The existing site at 
Lakeland View north of Penrith is proposed for extension in policy PEN1. Travelling 
showpeople are another group whose needs are often overlooked. They have different 
needs and requirements in terms of accommodation to other travellers. There is an 
anticipated need  for two permanent pitches up to the year 2018 to cater for the needs of 
this group. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.14.3 We specifically need to meet the needs of hard to reach groups and ethnic minorities 
within the district. Two such groups whose needs are often not met are Gypsies and The suitability  of any  sites will be tested  against  the following criteria:  
 Access to  schools,  shops  and other community  facilities are within  reasonable  
travelling distance, and can be reached  by foot, cycle  or public transport.  
 The site is served  (or can be served)  by adequate water  and sewerage  connections.  
 The amenity  of nearby  residents  or operations  of adjoining land  uses  would  not be 
materially  harmed.  
 The siting  and landscaping ensure  that any impact  upon  the character  and 
appearance  of the countryside  is minimised,  and the development  can be 
assimilated  into its surroundings.  
 The development  would  not harm  the natural  or historic environmental  assets  of the 
district.  82  Travellers. Failure to provide adequate sites can mean increasing use of unauthorised 
encampments.

4.16 Policy EC1 - Employment Land Provision 
 
Explanation 
4.16.1  This policy sets out the amount of employment land that this plan intends to release up to 
the year 2032. The level  of employment land allocated and the distribution of allocated 
sites across the district is contained in the town plans set out in Chapter 3. 
Reason for this policy 
4.16.2  This policy is essential to providing certainty on how much land for new employment will 
be released and safeguarding it in the future, to encourage the future economic growth of 
the area. In order  to meet  the employment  land needs  of the district  up to 2032,  the Council,  its 
partners  and service  providers  will ensure that  provision  will be made  for 27.3 hectares  of 
land for employment  development  (B1, B2 and B8 uses), in line with the locational  policy  
set out in LS1. 
Alternative  sites which  come  forward  during  the plan period  will be determined  against  the 
criteria  listed in  Policy  EC3.  
In recognition  that land at Eden  Business  Park Phase  2 is constrained, the Council will  
give favourable  consideration  to any proposals  for B1, B2 and B8 purposes  on 
unallocated  sites which  are well related  to Penrith  and its transport  infrastructure  and 
which  have  acceptable  effects  in terms  of landscape  character.  85  4.17 Policy EC2 - Protection of Employment Sites 
Planning permission for non-employment uses on land allocated for employment 
development will not be permitted unless there is no reasonable prospect of a site being 
used for that purpose. 
On non-allocated sites, where land is currently or last in employment use permission will 
be given for alternative uses if there is no strong economic case for the retention of the 
site as an employment use and there is no significant adverse impact upon the continued 
operation of neighbouring existing uses. 
This applies where any of the following criteria apply: 
 The loss of the site would not have an unacceptable impact on the quality and 
quantity of employment land and premises in the area. 
 The development would result in the removal  of a non-conforming use from a 
residential area. 
 The benefits arising from the new use for the locality outweigh the disadvantages 
caused by the loss of an employment site. 
 It can be shown that the continued use of the site for employment use is no longer 
viable. 
 
Explanation 
4.17.1 This plan aims to support and develop Eden’s economy, and to this end includes 
allocations of employment land, which can be found in Chapter 3. This  policy seeks to 
protect these allocated sites from a possible change of use. In addition, it seeks to protect 
employment land and existing employment sites unless there is a reasonable prospect 
that a site will not be able to be developed for employment or retained in employment 
purposes. Change of use from employment use will only be granted if the benefits of the 
resultant use outweigh the loss  of the site for employment use, for example through the 
provision of additional local  services, through providing opportunities for wildlife creation or 
through the creation of renewable energy technologies. Where a change of use from 
employment to retail use is proposed Policy EC7 (which applies a sequential  test to new 
development) will apply. 
4.17.2  In determining the viability for employment, a development appraisal should accompany 
proposals to clearly demonstrate why redevelopment for employment purposes is not 
commercially viable, identifying the abnormal and other costs which would prevent an 
appropriate employment scheme coming forward within a reasonable timescale during the 
plan period. Development Appraisals should be prepared on an open book basis. In 
assessing viability, consultation should also be undertaken with the Council and others to 
explore the range of funding sources and mechanisms that could potentially be used to 
bring forward sites. Also, if a wholly employment scheme is not a viable form of 
development, developers / applicants will also be expected to consider whether mixed-use 87  development (including an appropriate element of employment) would be an effective 
means of overcoming viability constraints. 
Reason for this policy 
4.17.3 To ensure sites allocated for employment use in this  plan are not developed for other uses 
unless it can be demonstrated that employment uses are no longer viable in that location. 
4.18 Policy EC3: Employment Development in Existing Settlements 
 
Explanation 
4.18.1  This policy sets out the criteria to be applied when assessing whether new employm ent 
proposals will be acceptable. It is intended to apply to employment development within the 
allocations identified in this plan, as well as other proposals  which may come forward 
outside of these allocations on land within and on the edge of Penrith, the three market 
towns and also the district’s key hubs. 
4.18.2 Where proposals  do not meet one or more of the above criteria, the acceptability of 
proposals will be considered against the wider employment, economic  and other benefits 
of the development. If it can be shown that the potential scheme will offer significant long- 
term economic benefits which apply beyond the local  area and that schemes are capable 
of minimising or mitigating negative impacts as far as reasonable permission may be 
granted. 
Reason for this policy 
4.18.3 The policy is included to seek to ensure that any employment development is appropriate 
to its location and that it does not cause unacceptable impacts on the local area. It also 
provides a framework for allowing appropriate new employment development outside of Employment  development  within  and adjacent  to existing settlements,  including  proposals  
outside  of the employment  allocations  listed  in the  Town  Plans, will be permitted  where  all 
of the following criteria  can be  met: 
 Development  is of a scale,  type and design  sympathetic  to the location  within  which  it 
is proposed.  
 Devel opment  would  not have  an unacceptable  impact  on highways  or other  forms  of 
infrastructure.  
 Development  would  not cause  harm  to local amenity,  landscape,  ecology,  historic  
environment  or other  environmental  and cultural  heritage  considerations.  
 The developm ent is capable  of achieving appropriate  standards  of access,  servicing,  
parking  and amenity  space.  
Where  development  does  not meet  all of the above criteria,  development  may still be 
acceptable  when  assessed  against  the wider  employment/economic  benefits  of the 
scheme.  88  allocations so as not to prevent sustainable economic development and the necessary 
growth of the economy and employment in the area. 
4.18.4 The principal theme running through the National Planning Policy Framework is facilitating 
economic grow th and the need to build a strong economy: “Planning should operate to 
encourage and not act as an impediment to sustainable growth”. Authorities are expected 
to set a clear vision and economic strategy to promote growth, set criteria for or identify 
strategic sites, support business, promote knowledge clusters and identify priority areas 
for economic regeneration which policy EC3 seeks to achieve. 
4.18.5 Equally, the National Planning Policy Framework is clear that policies should avoid the 
long-term protection of sites allocated for employment where there is no reasonable 
prospect of the site being used for that purpose and draft Policy EC2 ensures suitable 
flexibility is afforded during the plan period. 
Tourism Development 
4.18.6  The following policy is concerned with the development of tourist accommodation and 
services in Eden. The first part relates to larger scale accommodation which is capable of 
providing an economic benefit beyond its immediate locality, and the second part covers 
smaller scale accommodation, including holiday lets and caravan, chalet, and camping 
sites (including camping pods). 89  4.19 Policy EC4 - Tourism Accommodation and Facilities 
Large scale tourism proposals that would result in a substantial increase in visitor 
numbers will only be permitted if the following criteria are met: 
 The development proposed improves the range or quality of tourism accommodation 
and facilities in the area. 
 The site is close to the strategic road network. 
 They offer substantial economic benefits to the district. 
 The development offers the highest possible standards of siting, design and 
landscaping. 
 The traffic generated by the proposal will not have an unacceptable impact on nearby 
settlements or the local network. 
 Arrangements have been made to provide access by means other than the private 
car. 
 The tranquility and dark skies associated with the open countryside are not 
compromised. 
Small scale tourism development will be permitted for permanent structures (e.g. new 
holiday cottages) where it meets one of the following criteria: 
 Any proposed new-build development is located within a Town or Key Hub. 
 The proposal involves the re-use of an existing building, or previously developed 
land. 
 The proposed development forms part of a farm diversification scheme. 
 The development proposed is located outside of a Town or Key Hub, but due to the 
nature of the development proposed it relies upon a specific geographic resource or 
countryside location, and the specific location selected for the development can be 
justified. 
The Council may impose planning conditions to avoid permanent residential use of such 
sites where they are located in the open countryside. 
Small scale tourism development will be permitted for temporary accommodation 
(caravan, camping and chalet sites) where it meets a ll of the following criteria: 
 The site is screened by existing topography and vegetation. 
 Suitable access and car parking arrangements are defined and the site does not give 
rise to unacceptable impacts on the local  road network either through traffic 
generation from the site itself or through cumulative impacts alongside other sites.

Explanation 
4.19.1  Eden offers a tranquil and beautiful landscape, and also sits on the fringes of the Lake 
District and Yorkshire Dales National  Parks. This makes Eden a popular tourist location, 
and one which currently accommodates major tourist facilities such as Centre Parcs and 
Rheged. Eden District offers a wealth of opportunities for tourists based on both the 
natural and built environment, and is crucial to the economic development of the district 
and job security and prosperity of its residents. A massive £240m  was spent by 4.1m 
visitors in 2012. Tourism supported 3,760 full time equivalent in jobs in 2012  (14% of the 
district’s total) and showed a 5% increase on the previous year.9 
4.19.2 Small-scale tourism developments have also formed the mainstay of the tourism industry 
in Eden. We will look favourably at new sites, which are submitted to us, which will help to 
boost our tourism economy and support local services. Small scale under the terms of this 
policy refers to caravan, camping (including camping pods) and chalet sites of up to 
twenty units or pitches. 
4.19.3 Where no existing residential accommodation exists to service small scale non-permanent 
sites the expectation will be that any on-site management will be undertaken from one of 
the units or pitches that will be provided from the non-permanent units or pitches proposed 
as part of the development. Sites operating for caravan, camping or chalet use will also 
require an environmental license, which permits use subject to meeting relevant health 
and hygiene codes set by the Local  Authority. This can be obtained by contacting Eden’s 
Environmental Health team. 
4.19.4  Where proposals  come forward in the North Pennin es Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
they will be expected to conform to Policy ENV3. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.19.5 To encourage the provision of holiday accommodation, which has economic benefits for 
the area, businesses and farms. As holiday accommodation is classed as housing for 
planning purposes, the policy also makes clear that the use of such accommodation will 
be restricted to holiday uses only. 
4.19.6 There are also aspirations within the Cumbria Local Economic Partnership (LEP) to 
encourage the growth of Cumbria’s tourist economy, so that it can be globally recognised 
as a global  tourist destination10. This policy will contribute towards the objectives of the 
LEP and support the diversification of the local economy.

the land on which  it was sited.  
The Council  may impose  planning conditions  to avoid  permanent  residential  use of such  
sites or seasonal  restrictions  where  neces sary to safeguard  the landscape.  91  4.20 Policy EC5 - Advertising/Signposting 
 
Explanation 
4.20.1 Legislation for the control  of adverts comes from the Town and Country Planning (Control 
of Advertisements) (England) Regulations (2007), which includes a definition of what is 
meant by advertisements. The regulations state that applications for the display of adverts 
should be assessed according to their location and siting, dominance in the street scene, 
style and size, materials, colour and finish, and, where appropriate, levels of illumination. 
Each of these issues may impact on local visual amenity and application submitted will be 
assessed as such. 
4.20.2 Part IV of the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 1992 
enables a Local  Planning Authority to make Areas of Special Control Orders for 
submission to the Secretary of State for approval. Most of the Plan area has been 
designated as an Area of Special  Control (the central areas of Appleby, Alston, Kirkby 
Stephen, Penrith, Shap and Tebay are excluded). Within Areas of Special Control the 
display of advertisements with deemed consent (i.e. without the need  for formal approval 
of the Local  Planning Authority) is subject to greater limitation. 
4.20.3 Where an advertisement is proposed to be located in a Conservation Area the Council will 
require evidence of how the impact on a heritage asset has been  taken into account. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.20.4 Advertisements are essential  to commercial activity. In a sparse rural area such as Eden 
they can also play a vital role in promoting business and tourism in remote areas. 
However, poorly placed or out of scale advertisements can have a detrimental impact on 
the appearance of the built and natural environment. This policy seeks to provide 
sa
feguards to make sure that new advertising is proportionate and sensitive to its 
surroundings. Applications  for consent  to display  advertisements  will be permitted  where  the size of the 
sign and the materials  to be used  are appropriate  to the location  and will not have  an 
adverse  affect  on either  the amenity  of the locality  or on  public  and road safety.  
Proposals  for the display  of advertisements  within  conservation  areas  will need to 
demonstrate how the historical  aesthetics  have  been  taken  into consideration  in the 
design  of the advertisement.  Proposals  which  are of an inappropriate  scale,  illumination  
or material,  would  lead to clutter  or obstruct  or detract  from the  character  or appearance  
of the conservation  area or the architectural  features  of the buildings  on which  they are 
displayed  will not be  permitted.  
Proposals  for advance  signs  on private  land outside  highways  limits which  refer to rural 
businesses,  tourist  attractions  or accommodation  will be permitted  outside  the Main and 
Market  towns  where,  in addition to meeting  the requirements  of the preceding  parag raphs  
of this policy:  the sign is required  to locate a destination  not on a named  road or readily  
identified  location,  identifies  the premises  only,  is not  illuminated  and uses  existing means  
of support  where  possible.  92  4.21 Policy EC6 - Telecommunications Infrastructure 
 
Explanation 
4.21.1 The size and topography of Eden means that there will be a need to establish new 
telecommunications infrastructure across the district. This policy seeks to ensure that new 
infrastructure makes use of existing sites and structures wherever possible. Any 
applications for new telecommunications infrastructure will be expected to demonstrate 
the need for their location if this is not the case. 
Reason for this policy 
4.21.2 This policy is designed to make sure that new telecommunications equipment is sited in a 
way that respects Eden’s landscape features, and the North Pennines Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty in particular. Expansion of  the electronic  communic ation  network  will be supported.  When  considering  
proposals  for new telecommunication equipment  the following criteria will be taken  into 
account:  
 Proposals  should  make  use of existing  sites and structures  wherever  possible.  
 The location  and appearance  of the proposed  apparatus  and associated  structures  
should  seek  to minimise  impact  on the visual  amenity,  character  or appearance  of the 
surrounding area.  On buildings  apparatus  and associated  structures  should  be 
located and designed  in order  to seek  to minimise  impact  to the external  appearance  
of the host building.  
 Equipment  should  not harm sensitive  areas,  including the  historic  environment,  areas  
designated  for their nature  conservation  interest  and areas  of landscape  importance,  
especially  the North  Penn ines Area  of Outstanding Natural  Beauty.  
When  considering  applications  for telecommunications  development,  regard  will be given  
to the operational  requirements  of telecommunications  networks, the technical  limitations  
of the technology and road safety.  93  4.22 Policy EC7 – Town Centres and Retailing 
Support will be given to maintaining and enhancing the vitality and viability of the 
following hierarchy of town and district centres: 
Penrith - Town Centre 
Alston, Appleby, Kirkby Stephen – District Centres 
Retail and other town centre developments of a scale appropriate to these roles will be 
supported, provided that: 
 They do not compromise the functional operation of existing town centre uses 
including essential service operations. 
 Where proposals lie within the primary shopping area, the development assists in 
maintaining its existing retail function and does not lead to a concentration of uses 
which risk  undermining the vitality and viability of town centres. 
 New shop fronts relate in scale, proportion, materials  and decorative treatment of 
the façade of the building and its neighbours. In conservation areas changes to 
shop fronts will not be permitted if they fail to contribute to the preservation and 
enhancement of the area’s character, appearance and setting. 
 The development respects the character of the environment of the centre, 
including its special architectural and historic interest. 
Proposals for main town centres will be required to be in accordance with the sequential 
test set out in the National Planning Policy Framework. 
Retail development outside town and district centres will only be permitted if it will not 
have a significant adverse impact on the vitality and viability of existing centres. Retail 
impact assessments will be required for proposals over 500 square metres gross  which 
are outside of centres. Additionally retail impact assessments will also be required for 
proposals over 250 square metres gross that are within 400 metres of the boundary of 
Alston, Appleby or Kirkby Stephen district centres. 
 
Explanation 
4.22.1  This policy sets out a hierarchy of retail centres for the district. In 2007 the Council 
commissioned the Eden Retail Study (updated in 2014) which produced evidence on the 
role the towns play in providing shopping facilities and whether there is any scope for 
additional retail development above and beyond that already planned. The study also 
established boundaries for the town centres of the four main towns, and boundaries for the 
primary retail areas within these centres. These boundaries are shown on the Policies 
Map. 
4.22.2 The review indicated that for convenience goods there is some capacity for new floorspace 
during the Local Plan period in Penrith, sufficient to suppo rt another supermarket of up to 
2,000 sq.m. gross floorspace. There is no capacity in Alston and very little in 94  Appleby and Kirkby Stephen. For comparison goods there is a significant capacity for 
new floorspace in Penrith in the longer  term for around 12,000 sq.m. gross  of floorspace, 
which may justify the allocation of new sites in or on the edge of the town centre. There is 
no potential for further comparison shopping in Alston and only a small amount in Kirkby 
Stephen. There is greater potential  in Appleby. 
4.22.3 The Council is not currently proposing to include any additional land allocations for retail  
development at Penrith. Although evidence suggests that there may be scope in the long- 
term future it is considered that the current stock of retail floorspace in the town is 
sufficient in the short to medium term. Recent retail developments have taken place at 
New Squares and Ullswater Road, and have yet to be fully occupied. This position will be 
monitored and if future take-up rates rapidly deplete the current vacant stock and demand 
sustains this position will be reviewed, either through a partial alteration of this plan or as 
part of a full scale plan review. 
4.22.4 The National Planning Policy Framework also advises that floorspace thresholds could be 
adopted by local planning authorities for impact assessment purposes. In considering 
appropriate floorspace thresholds it is particularly relevant to take account of the scale of 
proposals relative to the town and district centres, the vitality and viability of centres and 
the likely effects of new development on the town centre strategy, especially further out-of- 
centre retail developments. 
4.22.5 Retail evidence suggested that in the context of experience in other local authorities, a 
floorspace threshold of 500sq.m.gro ss is appropriate for Penrith as the main market town. 
Because Penrith’s catchment area is the whole of Eden District, the application of this 
threshold would apply throughout the district. The market towns of Alston, Appleby and 
Kirkby Stephen are heavily reliant on the presence of supermarkets as the anchor stores 
in the centres, and unrestricted development of convenience shopping facilities outside 
these centres of more than 250sq.m. gross could have a significant adverse impact. It is 
therefore proposed that a threshold of 250sq.m. gross would be appropriate for the district 
centres. The application of this threshold should apply to proposals within walking distance 
(400 metres)  of the boundary of a district centre. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.22.6  It is important that the Local Plan seeks to maintain and enhance the vitality and viability of 
the retail areas within the main centres. For new retail developments national  guidance 
outlines a sequential approach designed to retain retail uses within existing town centres, 
followed by appropriate sites on the edge of the town centre and finally out of centre sites. 
This policy defines Eden’s town centres and sets criteria for how proposals in these 
centres will be assessed. It also contains a mechanism to make sure that existing retail 
floor space in these centres is not lost to other uses wherever possible. 95  How Will We Implement These Policies?

4.23.1  The built and natural environment includes everything that surroun ds us: towns, villages, 
woodland, rivers and meadows. It also includes cultural and historical aspects such as 
conservation areas, listed buildings and archaeological sites. Eden’s residents and visitors 
place considerable value on the high quality of the district’s landscapes, towns, villages 
and wildlife and that quality is something the Council wants to protect and enhance. 
The Natural Environment 
4.23.2 Eden District has a remarkable natural environment. It has a large number of areas of 
natural beauty, nature conservation and amenity value that range from the limestone 
pavements at Orton Scar and Great Asby Scar to the Moorhouse and Crossfell area of the 
North Pennine Moors - an internationally designated site. The landscape of the district is 
of a particularly high quality. Part of Eden lies within the Lake District National Park, and 
although this is subject to its own regulatory framework, it is key to reflect the relationship 
with this area in development decisions made outside the designation boundary. Eden 
also encompasses a large area of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding  Natural 
Beauty. Many of the areas outside the national  designations are of a similarly high quality. 
4.24 Policy ENV1 - Protection and Enhancement of the Natural Environment, Biodiversity 
and Geodiversity 
New development will be required to avoid any net loss of biodiversity and geodiversity, 
and where possible enhance existing assets. Should emerging proposals identify 
potential impacts upon  designated sites, regard should be given to the objectives for 
each of the hierarchy of sites. 
The following designations are of international importance and will be afforded the 
highest level  of protection: 
International/European Sites 
 Special Areas of Conservation (SAC). 
 Special Protection Areas (SPA). 
 Candidate SACs or SPAs. 
 Ramsar sites. 
Where harm cannot be avoided, development will only be permitted where mitigation 
measures would result in no significant harm being caused. Where the proposal cannot 
rule out possible significant effects, no alternatives exist and the proposal is deemed to 
be of overriding public interest, the proposals will only be permitted if adequate 
compensatory measures can be put in place. 
 98  National Sites 
The following areas are of national importance to the promotion and protection of 
biodiversity and geodiversity: 
 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). 
 National Nature Reserves (NNR). 
 Limestone Pavement Orders (LPO). 
Protection of these sites  will be given significant weight when determining planning 
applications. Proposals which either directly or indirectly impact on the integrity of the 
sites will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances, where alternative sites have 
been ruled out and significant benefits  have been identified which outweigh the impacts 
on the ecological network. 
Local Sites 
The following areas are considered of local importance to the promotion and protection 
of biodiversity: 
 County Wildlife Sites (CWS). 
 Regionally Important Geological Sites (RIGS). 
 Local Nature Reserves (LNR). 
 Habitats and Species in the Cumbria Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP). 
 Habitats and Species of Principal Importance (NERC Act Section 41 list). 
Development which directly or indirectly affects these sites should only be permitted in 
circumstances where there is an identified need  for development in that location. The 
benefits derived from development must significantly outweigh the harm and loss to 
species, soils and habitats. 
All development, where appropriate, should follow the following principles: 
 It will protect a nd maintain and enhance habitats or species in the Cumbria 
Biodiversity Action Plan, including the linked wildlife corridors which support them. 
 It will protect, maintain and enhance features of geological value identified in the 
Cumbria Geodiversity Action Plan. 
 Residential and commercial sites will consider the benefits of including wildlife 
corridors as part of the open space requirement within new development. 
Where the significant development of agricultural land is deemed to be necessary, 
applicants should seek to avoid the best and most versatile land (defined as land in 
grades 1, 2 and 3a of the Agricultural  Land Classification) in preference of developing 
land of a poorer  quality. 99  Explanation 
4.24.1 The district has numerous sites designated for their nature conservation interests  including 
9 SACs/SPA’s of international importance. These sites are protected under national 
legislation. 70 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of national importance are also 
located in the district as well as sites of regional and local  importance such as Local Wildlife 
Sites (formerly County Nature Sites) and Regionally Important 
Geological/Geomorphological Sites (RIGS). 
4.24.2 This policy sets a hierarchy of sites important for their biodiversity and geodiversity value, 
and puts in place safeguards to protect and enhance these sites. Where development on 
designated sites cannot be avoided or mitigated, compensation measures in the form of 
habitat creation, restoration or enhancements off site will be required, linked to a planning 
agreement. 
4.24.3  It is important that the Local Plan promotes new development in a way that will support the 
implementation of the Cumbria Biodiversity Action Plan, whilst preventing proposals that 
would have an unacceptable impact upon the district’s  wildlife resources. The Action Plan 
is a key document in identifying an important range of habitats and species within the 
district. It aims to conserve the district’s threatened wildlife and outlines the objectives, 
targets and actions considered necessary to protect and enhance the wildlife heritage of 
the area. 
4.24.4  The National Planning Policy Framework recognises the benefits of best and most 
versatile agricultural land. Where agricultural land is highly graded (grade 1, 2 or 3a) the 
Council will seek to resist its irreversible loss to development. 
Reason for this policy 
4.24.5 The NPPF requires Local Authorities to develop criteria based policies for the natural 
environment that proposals can be evaluated against. A hierarchy of sites should be 
identified in the Local Plan, so that weight can be proportioned to their status and their 
importance to the wider ecological networks can be fully understood. 100  4.25 Policy ENV2 - Protection and Enhancement of Landscapes and Trees 
New development will only be permitted where it conserves and enhances distinctive 
elements of landscape character  and function. 
Proposals should take account of and complement: 
 The distribution and form of settlements and buildings within their landscape setting. 
 Local styles and materials of buildings  within the settlement. 
 Natural elements such as hedgerows, woodland, and local topography. 
 Any visually sensitive skylines or hill and valley sides. 
 The tranquility of the open countryside. 
The impact of potential new development will be assessed against the criteria within the 
Cumbrian Landscape Assessment Toolkit (or successor  documents) with regard to the 
particular Character Area’s key characteristics, local distinctiveness and capacity for 
change. 
Development should contribute to landscape enhancement including the provision of 
new trees and hedgerows of appropriate species and in suitable locations. Loss of 
ancient woodland and significant/veteran trees will not be permitted unless it can be 
demonstrated that there is an overriding need for the development which outweighs their 
loss.
 
Explanation 
4.25.1 The landscape is an important element of the district’s environment and its local character 
needs to be protected and enhanced. A Cumbria-wide Landscape Character Assessment 
(LCA) and toolkit has been produced and is intended to aid district authorities when 
considering new development that might affect landscape character and help inform 
planning applications. 
4.25.2 The Cumbria Landscape toolkit separates Cumbria out into thirteen landscape character 
types. Eight are relevant to Eden: 
 Type 5 - Lowlands 
 Type 6 - Intermediate Farmland 
 Type 8 - Main Valleys 
 Type 9 - Intermediate Moorland and Plateau 
 Type 10 - Sandstone Ridge 
 Type 11 - Upland Fringe 
 Type 12 - Higher Limestone 
 Type 13 - Fells and Scarpe 101  4.25.3 Planning applications that may have a potential effect on Eden’s landscapes, trees and 
hedgerows will be expected to demonstrate how any impact has been  considered and 
mitigated, with reference made to relevant landscape character assessments. 
Reason for this policy 
4.25.4 Eden h as a wealth of attractive landscapes, which give it its distinctive character and 
contribute enormously to quality of life in the district. A specific policy is therefore included 
to make sure these assets are safeguarded for the future. The policy also seeks to protect 
trees and woodland from new development. 
4.26 Policy ENV3 - The North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
Development within or affecting the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
(AONB) will only be permitted where each of the following criteria apply: 
 Individually or cumulatively it will not have a significant or adverse impact upon  the 
special qualities or statutory purpose of the AONB. 
 It does not lessen or cause harm to the distinctive character of the area, the historic 
environment, heritage assets and their setting. 
 It adheres to any formally adopted design guides or planning policies, including the 
North Pennines Management Plan, the North Pennines AONB Planning Guidelines 
and the North Pennines AONB Building Design Guide. 
Major developments, defined in Appendix 2, will only be permitted in exceptional 
circumstances, where they are in the long term public  interest and where there has been 
a full consideration of each of the following criteria: 
 The need for the development, including in terms  of any national  considerations, 
and the impact of permitting it, or refusing it, upon the local economy. 
 The cost of and scope for developing elsewhere outside of the designated area or 
meeting the need for it in some other way. 
 Any detrimental effect on the environment, the landscape and recreational 
opportunities, and the extent to which that could be moderated. 
 
Explanation 
4.26.1 The purpose of AONB designation is to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the 
area. Unlike national parks, recreation is not a primary reason for designation. 
4.26.2 Applications for development which can demonstrate adherence to the principles set out in 
the North Pennines AONB Planning Guidelines and Building Design Guide (adopted as 
Supplementary Planning Documents in 2011) will have a strong likelihood of being granted 
permission. 
 102  Reason for the Policy 
4.26.3 The North Pennines AONB, designated in 1988 is the largest area of outstanding natural 
beauty in England and its long-term preservation and enhancement is of the utmost 
importance. This policy has therefore been included to afford it the highest degree of 
protection. 
4.27 Policy ENV4 - Green Infrastructure Networks 
 
Explanation 
4.27.1 Green infrastructure (GI) relates to the active planni ng and management of networks of 
multi-functional open  space. These networks need to be managed and designed to support 
local biodiversity and enhance the quality of life for Eden’s residents and visitors, 
particularly in areas undergoing larger scale change, for example on the edge of the 
district’s towns. They can help create a sense of place and provide additional  opportunities 
for recreation such as walking or cycling, including easing access to the wider countryside. 
They also perform a strong environmental role, particularly in terms of providing or 
maintaining habitats and supporting sustainable drainage systems. The following areas can 
form part of green infrastructure networks: 
 Parks and gardens, including urban parks, country parks and formal gardens. 
 Natural and semi-natural urban green spaces, including woodlands and wetlands. 
 Green corridors, including rivers and their banks, cycle ways and rights of way. 
 Wildlife corridors. 
 Outdoor sports facilities, including playing fields, sports pitches and golf courses. 
 Amenity green space including informal recreational areas, green spaces around 
housing, domestic gardens and village greens. A multifunctional  network  of green  infrastructure  will be identified,  protected,  managed  
and enhanced.  
Proposals,  which  protect  and enhance  the existing network  and promote  the creation  of 
new green  infrastructure  will be supported.  Development  which  leads  to direct  loss, 
fragmentation  or degradation  of green  infrastructure  will be resisted  unless there  is 
demonstrable  evidence  of wider  public  benefits  from the proposal.  
New development  should  ensure  that: 
 Opportunities  for the protection  and enhancement  of the district’s green  
infrastructure  network  are maximised.  
 Proposals  account  for any known  local deficiencies  of green  infrastructure  identified  
by the Council.  
Contributions  may be sought  for off -site provision  where  this leads  to the creation  and 
maintena nce of a strategic  network  of green  infrastructure  capable  of bringing benefits  
to the users  of the development.  103   Allotments. 
 Cemeteries and churchyards. 
 Accessible countryside. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.27.2 This policy is included to ensure that connected networks of green spaces around new 
development are treated as integral to a planning and design process which is conscious of 
its own place within wider green infrastructure networks. Green Infrastructure should not 
just be considered as  an adjunct to new development. 
4.28 Policy ENV5 – Environmentally Sustainable Design 
Proposals for commercial development and for major residential development, defined in 
Appendix 2, should demonstrate, where it is  practical for them to do so, that they have 
considered each of the following criteria: 
 Maximising daylight and passive solar gain through the orientation of buildings. 
 Integrating sustainable urban drainage systems. 
 Designing and positioning buildings to minimise wind funnelling, frost pockets  and 
uncomfortable microclimates. 
 Integrating renewable energy technology into the scheme, and in schemes 
comprising over fifty dwellings or on sites over 1.5 hectares, exploring the scope for 
district heating. 
 Minimising construction waste, through for example designing out waste during the 
design stage, selecting sustainable and efficient building materials and reusing 
materials where possible. 
 Providing well-designed and visually unobtrusive outdoor waste storage areas to 
promote recycling. 
 Promoting sustainable transport modes, through for example careful  layout and road 
design to ensure it is conducive to walking and cycling and prioritises the pedestrian 
and cyclist over the car. 
 
Explanation 
4.28.1 New development must play its part in promoting the efficie nt use of resources, and 
responding to the challenges posed by climate change. This policy does not seek to set 
rigid requirements for new development, and recognises that all schemes will present their 
own environmental challenges and opportunities. Its purpose is to encourage developers 
to consider the opportunities for enhancing the environmental sustainability of their 
schemes at the outset, so that environmental considerations can inform and help shape 
the design process rather than being an afterthought. For proposals, which require Design 104  and Access statements, the Council will expect applicants to demonstrate how they have 
considered enhancing the environmental sustainability of their scheme in the statement. 
4.28.2 There is a wealth of guidance and best practice case studies available on the aspects of 
sustainable design covered within the policy, which will undoubtedly evolve through the 
Local Plan period. Examples of guidance and sources of useful information at present 
include the SuDS Guide that has been  prepared by Cumbria County Council, the guidance 
and information on minimising construction waste and increasing resource efficiency 
provided by Wrap11, and information and case studies on renewable energy and 
sustainable construction provided by Cumbria Action for Sustainability12. 
4.28.3  Residential development is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and in Eden 
household fuel and electricity is estimated to contribute over 20% to each resident’s 
carbon footprint. Driving up energy efficiency standards in new housing is therefore an 
important priority to help meet greenhouse gas  targets, as well as tackling issues of high 
household bills and fuel poverty which are key issues in Eden. As a result of the 
Government’s National Standards Review, which was finalised in March 2015, local 
authorities can no longer apply additional standards relating to the construction, internal 
layout or performance of new dwellings. The review has resulted in the withdrawal of the 
Code for Sustainable Homes, and the energy efficiency of new homes will instead be 
governed solely by Building Regulations. 
Reason for this Policy 
4.28.4 The Climate Change Act of 2008 requires that by 2050 there must be a national reduction 
of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% from 1990 levels. One of the main ways in 
which we can mitigate against climate change is through a reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
4.28.5 The planning system has a key role to play in contributing the achievement of sustainable 
development. The NPPF  is clear in stating the role of the planning system in promoting the 
prudent use of natural resources, minimising waste, and mitigating and adapting to climate 
change including moving to a low carbon economy. This policy therefore sets a supportive 
framework to encourage proper consideration of environmental sustainability and climate 
change mitigation and adaptation measures in the design of new development. 
 
11 www.wrap.org.uk,  
11 www.cafs.org.uk  105  4.29 Policy ENV6 – Renewable Energy 
Renewable and low carbon energy schemes will be supported where they meet each of 
the following criteria: 
 Proposals  can be incorporated into the local landscape without significant adverse 
impact. Particular attention will be paid to the landscape impact of proposed 
developments which are located close to or within the North Pennines AONB and the 
National Parks. 
 Proposals  respect the form of the built environment, including settlement character 
and heritage assets, with particular attention paid not only to the potential impact on 
the heritage asset itself, but also to its wider setting. 
 The development proposed will not have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of 
local residents and can demonstrate that there is sufficient mitigation measures to 
minimise the impact of noise, smell or other nuisance or pollutants likely to affect 
nearby occupiers and neighbouring land uses. 
 It can be demonstrated that the natural environment, including designated sites will 
not be adversely affected (and where possible enhanced). 
 The local road network can satisfactorily accommodate the development proposed. 
 The proposed scheme will provide benefits to the community through their 
involvement with the proposal. 
 Where necessary, an assessment of the cumulative impacts of renewable energy 
developments has been  undertaken, and there is found to be no significant adverse 
impact. 
 The proposed scheme will not have an unacceptable effect on civil or military aviation 
and/or other defence related installations. 
 The proposed scheme will not have an unacceptable effect on existing 
telecommunications infrastructure. 
 Suitable measures have been included for the removal  of redundant structures or 
equipment and for the restoration of the site, should the site become non-operational. 
 In addition to the criteria above, proposals involving wind energy development, are 
required to be located in a ‘suitable area’ (identified on the Policy Map) and following 
consultation, it must also be demonstrated that the planning impacts identified by 
affected local communities have been fully addressed and therefore the proposal has 
their backing. 
Where mitigation is required to make any identified impacts acceptable these will, where 
necessary, be secured through conditions or pl anning obligations. 106  Explanation 
4.29.1 Eden is a large but sparsely populated district with high quality, undeveloped landscapes. 
It also contains a number of landscape designations such as the North Pennines AONB, 
which under national planning policy demands that great weight is given to the 
conservation of landscape and scenic beauty. 
4.29.2 The Council recognises the importance protecting our natural environment whilst making 
the most effective use of our natural resources through renewable energy generation. 
Renewab le energy is the collective term used for repeatedly occurring natural energy 
sources; typically these include energy from wind, biomass, waste, hydropower, solar, 
heat pumps, wood fuel and others as technologies develop. This criteria based policy will 
be used to ensure that renewable energy development is sited in the most appropriate 
locations, be that large scale or  micro-renewable schemes (where planning  permission is 
required). 
4.29.3  Applications for types of renewable energy technologies, such as anaerobic  digestion 
plants which import off-site waste materials would come under the remit of Cumbria 
County Council as the Planning Authority for Minerals and Waste. 
4.29.4 The Cumbria Renewable Energy Study (2011) considers a range of renewable  energy 
sources, translating potential into capacity up to 2030. The study considers potential 
technical capacity from wind, biomass, energy from waste, hydropower, solar and heat 
pumps. The study identified the potential for an additional  71MW by 2030. 
4.29.5  Specific guidance in regard to wind energy developments in Cumbria is contained in the 
Cumbria Wind Energy Supplementary Planning Document (SPD), which was adopted by 
Eden District Council in 2008. The SPD, alongside the Cumbria Renewable Energy Study 
(2011) addresses the concurrent needs, outlined in the NPPF and supporting guidance, 
for local planning authorities to prepare positive strategies in regard to renewable energy 
development, and conserve and enhance valued landscapes. The SPD includes a 
detailed landscape capacity assessment, which highlights the key characteristics and 
particular sensitivities which inform the potential  capacity of different landscape areas to 
support wind energy development. This has been developed to enable a consistent and 
holistic approach to be taken when considering the effects of wind energy development on 
the distinctive and often high quality landscape character  of Cumbria. The SPD contains 
guidance on the assessment of cumulative impact. Cumbria County Council have also 
produced a further evidence base and guidance in regard to the cumulative impacts of 
vertical infrastructure upon landscape character and visual amenity across the county. 
This work will be a material  consideration in the assessment of the cumulative effects of 
wind energy proposals. As set out above the work to define “Suitable Areas” in the related 
background Topic Paper has been based on landscape character considerations and has 
not specifically taken into consideration other factors. 
4.29.6 Proposals for renewable energy developments  may inevitably have some local  
environmental implications. Any significant adverse impact should be considered against 
the wider social, economic and environmental benefits of a scheme. 107  4.29.7 In June 2015 Greg Clark MP announced in his Ministerial Statement t hat new 
considerations to be applied to proposed wind energy development so that local people 
have the final say on wind farm applications, the NPPG was  subsequently amended to 
reflect these new provisions. As a result the Council has undertaken an assessment of 
‘suitable areas’, which can be found on the Policies Map. 
4.29.8 In order to address community concerns and in the interests of residential amenity and 
safety, a minimum separation distance of 800m between wind turbines (over 25m to blade 
tip) and residential properties will be expected. It is recognised that in some cases due to 
site - specific factors such as orientation of views, land cover, other buildings and 
topography it may be appropriate to vary this threshold, where it can be demonstrated 
through evidence that there is no unacceptable impact on residential amenity. Shorter 
distances may also be appropriate if there is support from the local community. 
Reason for this Policy 
4.29.9 It is important that we create opportunities through the planning system for decentralised 
energy, and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. This policy therefore aims to encourage 
new low carbon energy schemes whilst setting out safeguards to ensure they have no or 
minimal impact on quality of life in the district. 
4.29.10 The NPPF  advis es that all local authorities should plan for a low carbon economy, 
recognising longer-term benefits of low carbon energy generation. The guidance promotes 
a proactive approach towards the creation of renewable energy sources, which recognises 
the responsibility of all areas to contribute towards energy generation. This approach is 
supported by the Cumbria Renewable Energy Study. 
4.29.11 This policy aims to mirror the supportive approach within the NPPF, whilst including 
provisions to ensure local landscapes are protected from inappropriate development and 
significant adverse effects can be avoided. 108  4.30 Policy ENV7 - Air Pollution 
All major development proposals, defined in Appendix 2, will be required to assess the 
likely impacts of the proposed development on air quality. Development proposals will 
be expected to include mitigation measures to offset negative impacts, which may 
include: 
 Ensuring the development is located within easy reach of established public 
transport routes. 
 Maximising provision for cycling and pedestrian facilities. 
 Encouraging the use of cleaner transport fuels on site, through the inclusion of 
electric car charging points. 
 Contributing towards the improvement of the highway network where the 
development is predicted to result in increased congestion on the highway 
network. 
Development proposed nearby any Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) declared 
within the district will require an air quality assessment to identify the likely impacts of 
development upon the designated area. Permission will only be granted if the individual 
and cumulative impact of the proposed development on air quality is acceptable and 
appropriate mitigation measures are applied. Contributions towards measures identified 
to deliver the Air Quality Action Plan will be required as part of the development. 
 
Explanation 
4.30.1 Since December 1997 each local authority in the UK has been carrying out a review and 
assessment of air quality in their area. This involves assessing air pollution and trying to 
predict how it will change in the next few years. The aim of the review is to make sure that 
the national air quality objectives will be achieved throughout the UK by the relevant 
deadlines. These objectives have been put in place to protect people's health and the 
environment. 
4.30.2 If a local authority finds any places where the objectives are not likely to be achieved, it 
must declare an Air Quality Management Area. In Eden this process has led to parts of 
Penrith town centre (Victoria Road and Castlegate) and Eamont Bridge being proposed as 
Air Quality Management Areas. Development proposals which potentially would affect air 
quality in these areas will be required to be accompanied by an assessment of its potential 
impact, and set out the measures by which any potential impacts can be mitigated. 
Mitigation could include supporting the use of low emission vehicles, incorporating higher 
standards or alternative uses of energy in new buildings, contributions to traffic 
management measures or promotion of alternative forms of transport. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.30.3  To protect quality of life and the  natural environment, and to highlight that air quality issues  
exist in Penrith which new development proposals will need to take into account. 109  4.31 Policy ENV8 - Land Contamination 
 
Explanation 
4.31.1 Within Eden there are many historic and current land uses that have the potential to 
impact on the quality of the land and result in land contamination concerns. Former 
industrial and commercial processes, lower environmental standards, poor waste 
management practices together with accidental or deliberate release of chemicals into the 
environment may all result in land contamination. 
4.31.2 Eden supports the redevelopment of potentially contaminated sites but where a site is 
affected by contamination the responsibility for securing a safe development rests with the 
developer and/or landowner. Development of a site with land contamination 
considerations is an ideal way to secure an improvement in the environment providing that 
it results in a safe development that creates no unacceptable risks  to human health or the 
environment. 
4.31.3 Certain types of development are particularly sensitive to land contamination e.g. housing, 
schools, hospitals, allotments and children’s play areas. It is imperative that all developers 
have a comprehensive understanding of the history of a site; not just knowledge of the 
current or immediately previous use in the case of a derelict site. This will assist both the 
developer and the planning authority in determining the likelihood of risks  from potential 
land contamination and ultimately save costs. 
4.31.4 Identification of potential problems at an early stage can assist with the processing of 
planning applications and accelerate the development of sites. Since remediation of land 
contamination can incur significant costs it is important that the risks  are identified and 
understood both by the developer  and the local  planning authority before a planning 
decision is taken. Within Eden the Environmental Protection Team has a technical 
specialist that advises the planning department on the suitability of supporting information 
submitted as part of a planning application. It is strongly recommended that pre- 
application advice is sought from this officer regarding potential contaminated land issues. 
4.31.5 The requirement for a development to be sustainable and viable also extends to the 
remediation technology to be applied. For some developments, the technology required 
may impact on the design of the proposal. If potential  land contaminati on issues  are not 
identified and an assessment of the risks undertaken this may result in refusal of 
permission. The local planning authority must be satisfied that: The Council will  approve  development  on land that is contaminated  or where  
contamination  is suspected,  subject  to other  policies  if: 
 Adequate  contaminated  land assessments  prepared  by a suitably  competent  
person  are submitted  prior to any  planning  decision  being  taken,  to determine  
whether  or not unacceptable  risks to human  health  or the environment  arise  from 
the proposals.  
 Where  necessary,  suitable  remediation  is carried  out to ensure  safe development.  110   Where there is information available to the local planning authority that suggests the 
possibility of contamination or of unacceptable risk these concerns have been 
addressed or excluded within supporting information submitted with any application. 
 Any unacceptable risks identified can be adequately dealt with in order that the 
completed development is suitable for its intended use and no unacceptable risks 
remain either to human health or the wider environment. 
 Any steps needed to deal with unacceptable risks are either already in place or can be 
secured through suitable planning conditions. 
 The assessment of potentially contaminated sites should be carried out through a 
phased process. Ongoing dialogue with the local planning authority at each phase is 
recommended to ensure that the work undertaken is sufficient and necessary. 
 Where development is proposed on a site known to be contaminated or have the 
potential to be contaminated as a result of industrial  activity (e.g. gasworks, petrol 
stations, filled ground, steelworks, railway land) a preliminary risk assessment will be 
required. This must be carried out by a suitably qualified person to the current British 
Standards and approved guidance. 
4.31.6 Further advice and guidance on contaminated land is available on the environmental 
protection pages of the Council’s website. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.31.7 To make sure that issues relating to contaminated land are able to be addressed through 
the development management process, and to incorporate national policy from the 
National Planning Policy Framework into Eden’s development plan. 111  4.32 Policy ENV9- Other For ms of Pollution 
Noise, Vibration and Dust 
Development proposals for development likely to experience noise, light, dust, odour or 
vibration from road, rail or air, or other sources must be supported by an adequate 
assessment to assess risks  and their acceptability, and to ensure that appropriate 
mitigation is put in place to ensure occupiers are not adversely affected. 
Assessments should consider both the likely level of exposure at the time of application 
and any increase that might be reasonably expected in the foreseeable future. 
To safeguard the continued use of existing industrial  and commercial uses and to 
protect amenity, noise, light, dust and contamination sensitive development, proposals 
will need to demonstrate thatexisting levels of noise and vibration, light, dust or odour 
from industrial, commercial, leisure or sporting facilities are not likely to give rise to an 
unacceptable impact on the proposed development. 
To safeguard sensitive development from the impact of proposed industrial, commercial, 
leisure or sporting facilities, developers will need to demonstrate that: 
High levels of noise, light or dust will not occur throughout the construction phase of the 
development, especially at night, during the hours when people are normally sleeping. 
Development proposals for development likely to cause noise, light, dust, odour or 
vibration sources must be supported by an adequate assessment to assess risks  and 
their acceptability, and to ensure that appropriate mitigation is put in place to ensure 
existing noise sensitive premises are not adversely affected. 
Odour 
Agricultural development involving intensive livestock farming and development 
involving industrial or waste management proposals will only be permitted where it can 
be demonstrated that resultant odours will not impact on nearby development. An odour 
impact assessment will be required in all cases  where the proposed development has 
the potential to impact upon neighbouring premises or where the proposed development 
co
uld be impacted by odour from an existing use. 
Light 
Where a lighting scheme that could impact neighbouring premises is proposed as part of 
a development, an impact assessment will be required. This will need to evaluate the 
lighting levels and their acceptability against an agre ed methodology. Outdoor lighting 
schemes will be considered against the following criteria: 
No adverse impact on neighbouring uses, the wider landscape or dark skies. 
Light levels being the minimum required for security and working purposes. 
M
inimising the potential glare and spillage. 112   
 
Explanation 
4.32.1 All new development must aim to contribute positively to the quality of the environment 
and avoid any potential negative impacts upon residential  amenity, the natural 
environment or upon  leisure and recreational activities enjoyed by residents and visitors to 
the district. Development will therefore not be permitted where it would generate, either 
during construction or on completion significant levels of pollution, which cannot be 
satisfactorily mitigated within the development proposal. 
4.32.2  Further guidance on noise for anyone with a development proposal can be found in Eden 
District Council’s guide for planning application requirements. 
4.32.3 The policy also includes protection of groundwater ‘Source Protection Zones’. Zones are 
identified by the Environment Agency and have been established to protect wells, 
boreholes and springs used for public drinking water supply. They are split into three 
categories (inner, outer and total catchment) and show the risk of contamination from any 
activities that might cause pollution in the area. Any development proposed in such areas 
will be expected to demonstrate that there is no risk of pollution to groundwater  in these 
areas. Within potential areas of development within Eden the most notable location 
containing Source Protection Zones is to the north of Penrith. Be as  energy  efficient  as possible or run from a renewable  energy  source.  
Minimise upward  light pollution.  
Water Quality  
Development  will not be permitted  where  it would  generate,  either  in the construction  or 
operation  stages  adverse  impact  on the quality  of ground  and surface  water.  
Where  sites fall within  a Groundwater  Source  Protection  Zone  (SPZ),  consideration  
must  be given  as to how the site  will dispose  of foul and surface  water.  Developme nt 
within  Groundwater  Source  Protection  Zones  1 and 2 will not be permitted  unless  it can 
be demonstrated  that adequate  safeguards  to prevent  contamination  of the water  supply  
will be put  in place.  In accordance  with the Environment  Agency’s  Approach  to 
Groundwater  Protection  (March  2017),  the use of the highest  specification  pipework  and 
designs  for schemes  involving new sewerage  systems  will be required in Source  
Protection  Zone  1 to minimise  leakage  and the potential  for contamination  of the public  
water  supply.  113  4.33 Policy ENV10 - The Historic Environment 
The Council will attach great weight to the conservation and enhancement of the historic 
environment, heritage assets and their setting, which help to make Eden a distinctive 
place. 
The Council will require all proposals for development to conserve and where 
appropriate, enhance the significance of Eden’s heritage assets and their setting. The 
Council will support proposals that would better reveal  the significance of the asset, in 
particular those heritage assets identified as being most at risk. Opportunities for 
promotion, interpretation and increasing understanding should also be explored. 
Development proposals that would result in substantial  harm to or total loss of 
significance of a designated heritage asset or its setting will only be permitted where it 
can be clearly demonstrated that the public benefits of the proposal would outweigh the 
harm or loss, and that the harm or loss is necessary to achieve those benefits. 
The Council will require proposals to protect and where appropriate, enhance the 
significance and setting of Eden’s non-designated heritage assets, including buildings, 
archaeological sites, parks, landscapes and gardens. Where the harm is outweighed by 
the public benefits of the proposals, the Council will require an appropriate level of 
survey and recording, the results of which should be deposited with the Cumbria Historic 
Environment Record. 
Where a development proposal affecting an archaeological site is acceptable in 
principle, the Council will ensure preservation of the remains in situ as a preferred 
solution. Where in situ preservation is not justified, the development will be required to 
make adequate provision for excavation and recording before or during development. 
All development proposals affecting the historic  environment, heritage assets and their 
settings (including where there is the potential of unknown archaeological assets) will 
need to be accompanied by an assessment of the significance of the asset and its 
setting and how it will be affected by the proposed development. 
The level of information required will be proportionate to the significance of the asset 
and to the scale of impact of the proposal. For archaeological assets, this may where 
necessary include archaeological desk based assessment and field evaluation. 
The effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset 
should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that 
directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be 
required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the 
heritage asset. 
 
Explanation 
4.33.1 One of the features that makes Eden so unique is the quality of its historic environment. 
The district has twenty-four conservation areas (of which six are within the Yorkshire 
Dales National  Park), 1,600 listed buildings, over 200 scheduled ancient monuments and 114  5 registered parks and gardens. The full list of designated assets can be found on Historic 
England’s website. Eden’s historic environment is not only enriched by its designated 
heritage assets but also the wealth of other assets such as locally important buildings, 
earthworks and below ground archaeology and the landscape in which it sits. Together all 
these assets form an irreplaceable resource for understanding the past. 
Key elements include: 
 Castles, houses and their parks and gardens including Appleby, Brough, 
Brougham, Dacre, Dalemain, Kirkoswald, Lowther and Penrith. 
 Roman sites such as Voreda, and associated archaeology. 
 Prehistoric heritage including Long  Meg and her Daughters, the henges of 
Mayburgh and King Arthur’s Round Table, and also the numerous megalithic sites, 
burial  cairns and rock arts. 
 Conservation areas across the district in particular Penrith and the Settle to Carlisle 
Railway. 
 Remains of historic industrial  activity such as sites on Alston Moor including 
Nenthead and Whitesyke. 
 Historic market towns and settlements such as Penrith, Alston, Appleby and Kirkby 
Stephen. 
 Upland farming landscapes and their buildings. 
4.33.2 Listed buildings are protected by statutory controls, with listed building consent needed  to 
carry out works to buildings. In addition, planning permission can be needed where 
changes require substantial changes or demolition. This policy therefore sets out the 
criteria against which such applications will be judged. 
4.33.3 Conservation areas are legally defined as areas of 'special  architectural or historic interest, 
the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance'. The special 
character relates to the quality and interest of an area as a whole, rather than just 
individual buildings. In conservation areas, the normal  ‘permitted development’  rights 
which enable certain extensions and alterations to be carried out without the need  to 
obtain planning permission are reduced, thereby bringing more development under 
planning control. 
4.33.4 Development proposals in Conservation Areas will be required to be of a high quality and 
sensitive design and should be based on a careful consideration of issues such as scale, 
density, height and materials. Proposals will be expected to adhere to guidance set out in 
any relevant Character Appraisal  and the Management of Conservation Areas 
Supplementary Planning Document. 
4.33.5 Proposals that will have an impact on any heritage asset, whether designated or not, 
should be accompanied by an assessment of the significance of the heritage asset and 
how that significance will be affected by the proposed development. The level of 
information required will be proportionate to the asset's significance and to the scale of 115  impact of the proposal, and may require, where necessary, archaeological field 
investigation. Any heritage asset, whether designated or not, that is harmed by a proposal 
will need to be recorded by the developer to a level that is  proportionate to its significance 
and to the scale of impact of the proposal. The information will need to be made publically 
accessible in the County's Historic Environment Record. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.33.6 The district contains an extensive  wealth of heritage assets. These all represent a finite, 
non-renewable resource that is a significant asset in terms of quality of life and local 
distinctiveness. The historic environment makes  a strong contribution to the attractiveness 
of the area for tourism and business as well as being a driving force in conservation led 
regeneration. There needs to be a strong emphasis on the protection and enhancement of 
these sensitive environments. 
4.33.7 This policy includes safeguards to make sure that the character and appearance of 
heritage assets is protected. It also includes the criteria against which development 
requiring permission involving a conservation area or listed building will be judged. 116  How Will We Implement These Policies?

4.34.1  Community services and facilities ar e an essential part of life for the residents of Eden, 
and make up a large part of what contributes to the quality of life for the population. It is 
important that the four main towns in particular offer a wide range of accessible community 
facilities, so there is no need to travel  out of the district. Eden also contains an extensive 
patchwork of smaller villages where the retention of community services and facilities 
remains a key challenge if such villages are to thrive and retain their character. 
4.34.2 There are a number of features that make up a thriving community, from good quality 
affordable housing, local  jobs, open  space and green infrastructure, decent transport 
services and communications linking people to jobs, schools, health and other services 
throu gh to public, private, community and voluntary services that are appropriate to 
people's needs and accessible to all. Thriving communities are also communities that are 
active, inclusive and safe and are well run - with effective and inclusive participatio n, 
representation and leadership. 
4.34.3 Most of what makes up a successful and thriving community comes from the community 
itself. However, the planning system can play a role in supporting that community in 
protecting and raising its own quality of life. The following policies aim to provide a steer 
on how future development will be expected to support this aim. 
4.35 Policy COM1 - Principles for Services and Facilities 
Proposals for the development of or extension to community services and cultural 
facilities, including proposals that will assist in their retention, will be permitted where: 
 The scale and design is suited to the location. 
 It respects the local built environment, character and conservation interests. 
 It is compatible with residential amenity. 
 Appropriate parking and servicing arrangements can be made. 
 The use of buildings for multiple community functions will be encouraged and 
supported. 
Where permitted development rights do not apply, the change of use of rural  facilities 
such as a shop, public house, doctor’s surgery, dental surgery, school, bank, 
church/chapel, village hall, allotments or other facility considered important to the 
community will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that: 
 There is no longer a need  for the facility or sui table and accessible alternatives 
exist. 
 That it is no longer economically viable to provide the facility. 
 That the site has been  unsuccessfully marketed for sale in its current use. 120  Explanation 
4.35.1 This policy seeks to protect and enhance community facilities throughout Eden. In order to 
promote the social and economic vitality of local  communities the Local  Plan seeks to 
promote the provision of new services and facilities. The council will support  and 
encourage the development of community facilities including rural shop, public house, 
doctor’s surgery, dental surgery, school, bank, church/chapel, village hall, allotments or any 
other facility considered important to the community. 
4.35.2 It is not always possible to prevent closure of facilities when it is uneconomic for their use 
to continue, or where the change of use is permitted development. Therefore, proposals 
involving the loss of local  services  will be discouraged, but this policy does not restrict 
changes of use allowed under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (Use 
Classes) Order 1987  (as amended). 
4.35.3 The policy also provides specific safeguards to help prevent the loss of community facilities 
in rural areas, which can often run on the margin of viability. In rural Eden and in particular 
those villages that are not well served by public transport, a lack of such facilities can have 
a major impact on the vitality of local  communities as well as individuals, particularly the 
less mobile and those without access to a car. Once lost, these facilities c an be difficult to 
replace. For this reason, this policy requires that applicants demonstrate that it is no longer 
possible to run any existing facility as a profitable ongoing concern. This may require 
provision of evidence that the site has been  marketed for sale for the current established 
use for a sustained period. This  period is set as a minimum of twelve months unless it can 
be demonstrated that adherence to this requirement would result in a financial loss over 
that period. 
4.35.4  Linked closely to this policy is the Community Right to Bid. This is a new right created 
through the Localism Act that gives community groups the right to prepare and bid to buy 
community buildings and facilities that are important to them including a village shop, pub, 
community centre, allotment, parks, library etc. before they are privately sold. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.35.5 Community services and facilities are an essential part of life for the residents of Eden. 
One of the major challenges facing small rural settlements in particular is their ability to 
retain local services and facilities, which are essential for maintaining villages as 
sustainable communities. 
4.35.6 Supporting thriving rural communities is also one of the core planning principles set out in 
the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which requires Local Authorities to 
promote the retention and development of local services and community facilities  in 
villages, such as local shops, meeting places, sports venues, cultural buildings and places 
of worship. 121  4.36 Policy COM2 – Protection of Open Space, Sport, Leisure and Recreation Facilities 
 
Explanation and Reason for the Policy 
4.36.1  Open space and sport play an important role in the community, promoting health and 
wellbeing, social inclusion and community participation. Leisure and recreation facilities also 
benefit the local community in terms of cultural diversity, and their contribution to physical 
and mental health and wellbeing. This policy seeks the development and retention of these 
types of assets. Areas identified as open  space are shown on the Policies Map 
accompanying this plan. 
4.37 Policy COM3 – Provision of New Open Space 
 
Explanation 
4.37.1 In terms of open  space the Council appreciates that there is a need  to provide clarity on 
the level of provision required. The Council has undertaken a detailed need assessment of 
the provision of and need  for open space and recreation; this identifies all open space 
throughout the district together with an analysis of the quantitative need for new open Major  residential  schemes,  defined  in Appendix  2, will be expected to include  on-site 
provision  of open  space  unless  it is considered  impractical  or unfeasible.  An off-site 
contribution  may be considered  more appropriate  if it results  in the provision  of accessible  
open  space  for the development  or would  result  in the upgrading of  existing  facilities,  
which  can be  used  for the benefit  of the residents.  
On minor  residential  sites where  there  is a demonstrable  under  provision  of existing open  
space,  contributions  may be sought  towards  the provision  of additional  and accessible  
open  space  or for the upgrading of  existing facilities. The  contribution  may be sought  as a 
commuted  cash  sum payment.  Development  proposals  that result in  the loss of open  space,  sport,  leisure,  allotments,  
recreational  and cultural facilities will not be  permitted.  The exception  to this will be where  
the benefits  of the development  outweigh  the loss. Proposals must  satisfy  each  of the 
following criteria:  
 There  is a strong  social  or economic justification  for the  development.  
 There  is no longer  a need  for the facility  in the area,  or if a need  remains,  
alternative  provision  will be provided  nearby.  
Any replacemen t facility must provide  an equivalent  or greater  net benefit  to the 
community,  in terms  of quality,  availability  and accessibility  of open  space  or recreational  
opportunities.  
Where  development  of a small  area of the site would  enable  investment  to improve  the 
rest of the site this may be taken  into account  as a circumstance  under  which  benefits  
may outweigh  the loss of a site or facility.  122  space and the quality of existing open space. This indicates some substantial deficiencies 
in provision, particularly for amenity open space and play areas throughout the district. 
4.37.2 The following standards provide a level, or bench mark from which provision can be 
negotiated through the development management process to determine whether provision 
should be new, upgraded/enlarged existing provision or enhancement management, or 
other mechanism. 
4.37.3  For the purposes of this policy, open space is defined as: 
Type of open space  Indicative  quantity

1000 population)  Source

(Informal  Recreation)  0.986  Open  Space  Audit  2015  
4.37.4  Areas identified as open  space are shown on the Policies Map accompanying this plan. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.37.5  Eden, due to its sparse population and predominance of high quality countryside, presents 
both residents and visitors with a range of easily accessible informal recreation 
opportunities. However, due to the size and low population densities, more formal 
recreational opportunities are often more difficu lt to access. 
4.37.6 Open spaces in towns and villages in the district are often threatened by competing land 
uses, and it is important that they are offered appropriate protection. The Council is keen 
to assist in the delivery and retention of meaningful and practical open  space provision, 
which meets the needs of the people of Eden. The key issue is to ensure that there is 
quality provision with sustainable long-term management. 
4.38 Policy COM4 - Education and Health 
 
Explanation 
4.38.1 This  policy aims to ensure education and health facilities are provided to meet the need 
arising from significant levels of new development. Where development will result in 
increased demand on education facilities the Council will work with the education authority 
to establish the new demand and identify suitable new education sites  where required, Proposals  for the development  or expansion  of higher  and further  educational  
establishments,  schools,  new doctor’s  surgeries  and health  centres  will be supported,  
provided  that satisfa ctory  access to the site can be put in place  and adequate  car 
parking  is made  available.  123  similarly it will also work with local clinical commissioning groups to make sure provision of 
health facilities is taken into account when planning new development. 
4.38.2 There is currently one higher education college in the district (Newton Rigg at Penrith); five 
secondary schools (two in Penrith, and one each at Alston, Appleby and Kirkby Stephen) 
and eight primary schools within the four main towns of the district. There are a further 
twenty-seven in Eden’s villages (outside the National Park). In light of the Council’s 
housing targets, over the Local  Plan period it is expected that the number of primary 
school places within Penrith will increase significantly and the current provision will need to 
be increased. 
4.38.3 Where housing developments or the cumulative impact of a number of housing 
developments in an area gives rise to the need  for extensions, refurbishment and/or 
remodelling to provide additional capacity (including nursery capacity, as appropriate) at 
existing schools, the County Council will look to the developer to fund the cost of providing 
the additional capacity at existing schools at the appropriate time, including the cost of 
acquiring additional land if necessary. Policy DEV4 sets out the Council’s approach to 
seeking contributions for new infrastructure, such as schools, health facilities and 
cycleways. 
4.38.4 There are permitted development rights applying to the change of use of some sorts of 
development to new schools. Where these rights apply to new development this policy will 
not apply. 
4.38.5 Policy PEN1 includes an allocation for a new  primary school at Penrith. 
Reason for the Policy 
4.38.6  The National Planning Policy Framework recognises the importance of ensuring that there 
is a sufficient choice of school places available to meet the needs of existing and new 
communities, and that Councils should give great weight to the need to create, expand or 
alter schools; and work with schools promoters to identify and resolve k ey planning issues 
before applications are submitted. It is considered that this policy will contribute towards 
this. The policy also aims to put in place a supportive approach to the provision of new 
health facilities. 124  How Will We Implement These Policie s?

2010  PDP 
Associates  - 
On behalf  of 
EDC  Consultants  employed  
by the Council to 
assess the landscape  
considerations  for the 
Key Service  Centres.  
This will be used  as a 
key source of 
evidence  to identify  
locations  that will be 
sensitive  to future  
development.  Findings  from the report  
suggest  that sites in 
Alston  have  a medium to 
high value  of landscape  
importance.  Site AL11  
scored particularly  highly  
on the Southern  
boundary  of the town.  
Sites in  Appleby  were  
seen  to also have  a high 
impact.  Sites  to the 
South  West  of the 
settlement  were  
considered  the most  
sensitive.  Sites  around  
central Kirkby  Stephen  
can be seen  as the most  
sensitive  due to 
developing the currently  
unbuilt frontages.  The 
study  determined  that 
the highest  visual  impact  
for Penrith  would  be 
through  the development  
of sites to the East of the 
settlement,  extending  
past Carleton.  Sites  to 
the North,  in particular,  
the Raiselands  site, 
would  have  the least  
visual  impact.

Local Plan period  in 
Penrith,  sufficient  to 
support  another  
supermarket  of up to 
2,000  sq.m.  gross

capacity  in Alston  and 
very little in Appleby  and

is a significant  capacity  
for new  floorspace  in 
Penrith  in the longer  
term for around  12,000

County  
Council  A baseline  evidence  
base  that can be used  
when  making  
decisions  on future  
land use and 
management.  The document  identifies  
and maps  the different  
landscapes  across  the 
district.  This can be 
referred  to when  
producing  allocations  to 
ensure  development  
appreciates  and 
conserves  the factors  
that give the landscapes  
integrity.  135  Appendix 4 - Principles for Masterplans 
Policy PEN2 of this plan requires the urban extensions proposed at Penrith to be subject to a 
masterplanning exercise, which is developed and agreed in partnership with the Council. 
Masterplans will be expected to be in accordance with the objectives and outputs contained in the 
2011 Masterplan for Penrith. 
The following information should be included: 
How the scheme would fit in with the town and its environs 
 How the scheme would respect the existing character of the town, including how long distance 
views  are maintained as far as possible. 
 How the scheme has been designed to complement Penrith’s strong identity as a historic 
market town and rural service centre. 
 How the scheme has taken into account existing landscape character, as detailed in the 
Cumbria Landscape Character Assessment. 
 How the scheme has taken account of the Penrith Landscape and Visual  Impact Assessment. 
Design 
 The internal layout of the scheme, including how the streets, squares and open spaces are 
connect ed and how the development integrates with existing development. 
 The height, massing and bulk of buildings, and how the proposals respect the topography of 
the site. 
 How the scheme complements the existing character of the town. 
Movement and Accessibility 
 The movement patterns for people on foot, or by bicycle, car or public transport, or from refuse 
vehicles. 
Site Components 
 Housing numbers, type, mix and tenure. 
 Proposed community facilities. 
 Open space, including any public squares and recreational facilities. 
Infrastructure and Affordable Housing 
 Proposals for landscaping and the provision of green infrastructure. 
 Quantity, type and location of affordable housing provided as part of the scheme. 
 Additional transport infrastructure required. 
 Additional social infrastructure required - schools, medical facilities, cultural facilities, etc. 
 How the physical and social infrastructure necessary to support this amount of the 
development into the town is to be funded. 136   For sites falling within a Groundwater  Source Protection Zone (SPZ), consideration must be 
given for how the site will dispose of foul and surface water. Evidence should be provided to 
demonstrate that any future development within a SPZ will appropriately mitigate the risk to 
water quality. In accordance with Position Statement G8 of Groundwater Protection Principles 
and Practice (GP3) August 2013,  the use of the highest specification pipework  and designs for 
schemes involving new sewerage systems will be required in SPZ1 to minimise leakage and 
the potential for contamination of the public water supply. 
Opinions and Suggestions from Existing Residents 
Evidence of genuine public consultation including how feedback has been  taken into account. 137  Appendix 5: Policy HS1 - Local Connection Criteria - Affordable Housing Only 
A person will be considered to meet the local occupancy conditions if immediately before taking up 
occupation of the affordable dwelling, he/she or a member  of his/her household meets one of the 
following criteria: 
 The person lives in t he locality and has done  so for a continuous period of at least three 
years. 
 The person works permanently in the locality and has done  so for a continuous period of at 
least three years. 
 The person is an existing social tenant who needs to move to take up an offer of work in the 
district, as detailed in the Government’s ‘Right to Move’ statutory guidance (DCLG, March 
2015). 
 The person has moved away but has strong established and continuous links with the 
relevant locality by reason of birth or long term immediate family connections. 
 The person needs to live in the locality because they need substantial care from a relative 
who has lived in the locality for at least three years, or needs to provide substantial  care to 
a relative who has lived in the locality at least three years. Substantial care means that 
identified as required by a medical doctor or relevant statutory support agency. 
“Locality” refers to  the parish and surrounding parishes*. In terms of marketing an affordable 
property, if after a reasonab le period of active marketing an occupier cannot be found the 
definition would cascade out to include the County of Cumbria. 
*Where the new house is in Penrith “locality” refers to Eden District. 138  Appendix 6: Policy HS2 - Local Connection Criteria - Housing in the Smaller 
Villages and Hamlets listed in Policy LS1 
New houses permitted in the villages and hamlets under Policy HS2 shall only be occupied by a 
person with a local  connection and this will be controlled by a planning condition or legal 
agreement. A person with a local connection means a person who meets one of the following 
criteria: 
 The person lives in the locality and has done  for a continuous period of at least three years. 
 The person works permanently in the locality for a minimum of 16 hours per week. Where a 
person is employed in an established business that operates in multiple locations, their 
employment activities should take place predominantly inside the locality. 
 The person has a firm offer of permanent employment, for a minimum of 16 hours per week 
in an already established business within the locality. 
 The person has moved away but has strong established and continuous links with the 
locality by reason of birth or long term immediate family connections. 
 The person needs to live in the locality because they need substantial care from a relative 
who has lived in the locality for at least three years, or needs to provide substantial  care to 
a relative who has lived in the locality at least three years. Substantial care means that 
identified as required by a medical doctor or relevant statutory support agency. 
It
 is intended that housing permitted under policy HS2 will be restricted to those with a local 
connection in perpetuity. 
“Locality” refers to the parish and surrounding parishes*. In terms of marketing a local occupancy 
property, if after a reasonable period of active marketing an occupier cannot be found the 
definition would cascade out to include the County of Cumbria. 
*Where the new house is in Penrith “locality” refers to Eden District. 139  Appendix 7: Internationally Important Sites for Nature Conservation
