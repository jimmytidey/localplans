      "- Southwark's policies aim to address health inequalities by improving everyday experiences through better access to green spaces, free swimming, gym use, and an expanded bike hire and cycle network.\n",
      "- The borough plans to improve accessibility to public transport and enhance walking and cycling connections to public transport stops or stations.\n",
      "- Southwark's transport policy includes a reduction in car parking spaces to discourage car use and promote cycling and walking.\n",
      "- Strategic transport projects in Southwark include the Bakerloo Line extension, Healthy High Streets projects, and expansion of cycle hire, all of which are intended to improve cycling infrastructure and encourage active travel.\n",

      "- Tower Hamlets encourages the use of low emission vehicles, electric vehicles, bicycles, and freight consolidation facilities to reduce the environmental impact of deliveries and freight movements.\n",
      "- The borough supports the development of new wharves or other facilities for freight transfer between road, rail, or water to minimize environmental impacts.\n",

       "'As a driver campaigning for better driving infrastructure, I understand the importance of promoting sustainable travel options such as cycling, walking, and public transport. These modes of transportation have numerous benefits for the health and well-being of residents, employees, and visitors. However, it is crucial to ensure that the needs of drivers are also considered and improvements to driving infrastructure are included in the plans.\\n\\nWhile prioritizing the needs of pedestrians and cyclists and integrating development with public transport are important goals, it is essential to strike a balance that also addresses the needs of drivers. Measures that reduce road space and potentially inconvenience drivers should be carefully evaluated to ensure they do not create additional problems or hinder the efficient movement of vehicles.\\n\\nImproving driving infrastructure should be a priority alongside promoting sustainable travel options. This could involve expanding road capacity, improving traffic flow, and providing adequate parking facilities. These improvements would not only benefit drivers but also contribute to reducing congestion and improving air quality.\\n\\nIn conclusion, a balanced approach that considers the needs of all road users and includes improvements to driving infrastructure is necessary. By promoting sustainable travel options while also addressing the needs of drivers, we can create a comprehensive transportation system that benefits everyone.'"
