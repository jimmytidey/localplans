I’ve just got a job in one of the new offices with the help of Workspace travelling to work is easy.The new development in the area has been great for my business. The town centre now has an environment to match its stylish shops and more places people want to visit, stay for longer and spend more. It’s allowed me to improve my shopfront and renovate our home.I recently downsized. Luckily, I didn’t have to move far, so I’m still close to friends and family. My new home was wheelchair accessible so I didn’t have to make any adjustments. I can easily move around outside too – there are now lifts at every station and less clutter, traffic and pollution on the streets.\n",

I’m fitter and the air quality seems to be improving.I’m doing my A levels at a local college. It has great links to big and small local employers to help give me the relevant experience needed to get a job. I’m ambitious but also want to stay close to my family. The fact that I can easily access work and save to buy my own home in the local area is very important to me.We don’t need our own car anymore; our garage is now a play space for the kids and we’ve turned the front garden back into a garden.\n",

It’s amazing to have a park that links to Stratford and Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park all the way down to the Royal Docks and Thames, with loads of interesting things to see on the way. There are iconic buildings old and new, wildlife, and plenty of things for the kids to enjoy.\n",

I feel like its finall a place in its own right as well as part of something bigger.I am opening our new manufacturing plant in the Royal Docks. Our investors can see it has accessibility, connectivity, and is part of a growing cluster of similar businesses, services, higher education and research that will make it a success.\n",

It makes it easier for me to drop my toddler off at nursery, get to work, do my shopping, get to college in the evening and go to parks and events at the weekend.\n",

We’ve cut back on the number of vans we use, while our business has grown.All this space between here and the North Circular used to be totally inaccessible, now it’s like we’ve got a giant back garden to enjoy.Newham Local Plan 201811\n",

      "whereby in being outside the more restrictive city boundaries, it became the disproportionately-favoured location for dirty, malodorous and noisy industry and infrastructure, and in turn suffered significantly from the demise of the docks and decline of certain traditional industries, and poorly designed social housing estates. While access to a wide range of infrastructure and employment uses is acknowledged as an engine for growth that the Local Plan seeks to reinforce, achieving transformational change requires significant improvements in the quality of design and overall offer of development, including a more balanced mix of uses, greater attention to local as well as strategic needs, better integration between and across sites and neighbourhoods, and more consideration of opportunity costs and externalities as well as benefits. In some cases this is about new types and forms of development; in others, however, it is about providing adequate protection for industry and logistics (some of London-wide significance) and opportunities to work locally, breathing and social spaces and the settings of places and particular assets. \n",

Stratford town centre stands at the gateway to Newham, and is characterised by the High Street and historic buildings in the old centre, including the major landmark of St John’s Church, and the new green and sports infrastructure that form part of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Stratford is one of London’s major transport interchanges with excellent accessibility to Central London and the wider region and international destinations. It has a large indoor shopping centre and cultural quarter, including the Theatre Royal, Stratford Picture House and Stratford Circus. However, since the 1960s the town centre has become dominated by traffic with the shopping mall surrounded by busy roads. Most of the village of West Ham was redeveloped for social housing during the 1960s-70s and few original buildings survive. Notable exceptions include the landmark Norman church of All Saints and its Church Road ATV setting, and West Ham Park with its remnant 19th Century setting and views out of the park towards Stratford church and Canary Wharf. The area also includes Abbey Mills pumping station, a major listed industrial building forming part of the setting of Abbey Mills strategic site. \n",

Major investment in the development of the Olympic Park and the delivery of legacy sites, , has already resulted in transformational change to Stratford and West Ham, bringing major development and investment in the quality of the environment and lifting Stratford to an international role. Significant challenges remain in integrating the new with the old, including equalising environmental quality and widening access to the new opportunities provided by major development. Further reducing barriers to movement and integrating these areas is a key objective for the Local Plan, as set out in more detail in policy INF2, the IDP and the Character Study; in principle, enhancements and new connections to Key Movement Corridors, the Greenway and the Leaway/Lea River Park, will play a special role in realising this objective.  \n",

A strong connection will be formed between the existing town centre with finer grain retail, workspace and cultural assets, and Stratford City, with large scale new shopping and leisure facilities. This will create a vibrant place that will serve an international and regional community, given strategic transport connections already in place, whilst retaining a distinctive East End character. The town centre encompassing Stratford City and Stratford town centre will operate as an Employment Hub (see Policy J1), incorporating office, cultural, educational and community uses, as well as opportunities for high density residential development sensitively integrating with and enhancing the historic setting of the listed buildings and Conservation Areas. Further transformation in the quality of Stratford as an attractive and vibrant place will be sought, along with the implementation of specific public realm improvements.

      "through King George V Dock and Royal Albert Dock, London City Airport to Albert Basin, Albert Island and North Woolwich to the east, connecting and providing a relationship between areas across several Community Neighbourhood Areas. Almost half of the area is water. Much of the area is industrial, particularly south of the docks, with important economic drivers in these areas and around including the ExCeL conference centre, Tate and Lyle, University of East London and London City Airport. The Docks have benefited from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in recent years and the pace of change is becoming rapid, with new neighbourhoods emerging at Royal [Minoco] Wharf and an increase in planning applications coming forward on smaller sites, as well as infrastructure and social and economic regeneration projects underway partly under the auspices of the only Enterprise Zone in London. The Local Plan therefore needs to bring these opportunities together in a managed and coordinated way to maximise the long term benefits, acknowledging the opportunities for transformational regeneration, with potential to make a significant contribution to the borough’s objectives for providing new homes, jobs and services complementing and, where relevant, spatially referencing the ongoing joint-working between the GLA and the Council on the Enterprise Zone’s Detailed Delivery Plan and its financing, which will be further recognised in the evolving IDP . \n",

      "other and existing neighbourhoods, and the communities/neighbourhoods to the south of the Docks have lacked local facilities and defined Local Centres, as well as connections to nearby alternatives. The general quality of the urban environment continues to be a challenge with high levels of traffic, aircraft noise and heavy industrial activity, together with a lack of investment and legacy of poor post-war design in some areas, and some parts are isolated from the rest of Newham. The area’s relatively dispersed historic assets, including the Millennium Mills and Silo D, Former St Mark’s Church (Brick Lane Music Hall), and Victorian heritage of North Woolwich around the station and Woolwich Manor Way Area of Townscape Value, could also be better integrated and activated, and many form part of strategic allocations in the area that should help achieve this. Other important character assets include structures of the docks, river/dockside views and access, Lyle Park and Royal Victoria Gardens, as well as the more recent Thames Barrier Park. \n",

      "1.54 U rban Newham was built largely at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th \n",
      "century as a neighbourhood for city workers, with access to central London via the rapidly expanding railway and horse tram network. The area is characterised predominantly by its rows of densely packed terraced dwellings. The area also contains a number of important parks, including West Ham Park, Central Park and Manor Park Cemetery and the City of London Cemetery (a Grade I Historic Park) which fit into the urban structure. During the war, bombing raids created large gaps in the urban fabric, which were subsequently redeveloped for social housing in the 60s and 70s. Recent change has included estate-based renewal, redeveloping high rise point blocks and other problematic post-war housing to lower rise, high density housing. Other change has tended to be incremental – making the most of infill opportunities as they have arisen, (e.g. on surplus railway land and former small scale industrial sites) often increasing local densities due to an increase in taller, flatted development. \n",
      "1.55 The issues and opportunities described in the intr oduction to this plan are writ large over \n",
      "this existing built up area. In brief, the quality of development in much of the area is reflected in the proportion of the borough’s Conservation Areas and areas of townscape value and the potential for further designations. Public transport accessibility is generally good, with excellent tube connections with central London, Stratford and Barking. The coming of Crossrail in 2019 will open up more opportunities for development in Forest Gate, Manor Park and Maryland. This development will in turn enable the strengthening of the associated Town and Local Centres. These already exhibit local entrepreneurialism – as evidenced by activity in the centres and their fringes – and the borough’s most popular parks (Central Park, West Ham Park) are in this area or at its edge. Most development opportunity is focused in Town and Local Centres as retail and local infrastructure requirements change, and through redevelopment of other non-strategic and windfall sites, notably in LMUAs where managed transition to employment-led development more compatible with their residential contexts is expected, providing finer grained local employment as well as new homes. \n",
      "1.56 How ever, north-south public transport connections are comparatively poor, with problems of \n",
      "congestion in particular. Likewise, features of design quality evident in earlier development were not carried through into the quality of post-war, notably 1960s and 70s development, which is particularly affected by substandard housing and a lack of permeability. The quality of the public realm and movement corridors more generally in much of the area is also poor, affecting people’s enjoyment of the pedestrian environment, levels of cycling and their overall impression of the borough. Town Centres have been adversely affected by a proliferation of takeaways and betting shops, changes in shopping habits and the sub-regional offer, and general low levels of affluence, which in turn reflect high unemployment and inactivity rates. These factors, together with concerns over crime and grime, real and perceived deficits in the quantity and quality of community infrastructure including open space, high levels of subdivision of larger, more desirable properties, and significant \n",

      "Justification \n",
      "2.1 Cr eating successful places is the lynchpin of the Plan’s key objective to create a borough \n",
      "where people choose to live, work and stay, as well as being identified as important at a London-wide and national level. This policy and definition of place-making defines the macro-level ingredients that relates to how a place looks, feels and works for day-to-day personal, social and economic activity, together creating viability, flexibility, stability, safety and security, sociability, inclusivity, healthiness and environmental sustainability. It is applicable as much to proposals for ‘meanwhile’ uses, as more permanent ones, as such uses often prevail, and therefore have a significant impact in relation to the realisation of wider community visions. The policy thus supports the other objectives of the plan to optimise development and to deliver growth in cooperation with Newham’s strategic partners most notably the Greater London Authority.\n",
      "2.2 Building on the existing built envir onmental assets in the borough, the policy brings together \n",
      "all the different layers of a place which together are agreed to form the basis of lasting regeneration, with the principle of mixed use across an area at its heart. While there are many existing strengths, many of these components (or the relationship of development to them) are in need of improvement or adjustment according to local people and other stakeholders. \n",
      "2.3 W ithin a sizeable borough such as Newham, it is reasonable to expect a number of places \n",
      "of a scale that people can easily relate to and interact with in their day-to-day lives, that should be integrated and connected in a manner which recognises that one place is unlikely to fulfil a person’s needs in their entirety, and that people expect to be able to move freely and easily within an extended area. This is a key issue in the borough due to physical barriers and poorly conceived urban structure and street networks, contributing to the creation of harsh ‘edges’ rather than smooth transitions between areas. \n",
      "2.4 The distinctiveness of these places matters: positive distinctive identities ar e not only \n",
      "generally pleasing and conducive to creating a sense of somewhere people value and can feel they belong to, but also aid navigation across the wider area, and more fundamentally, boost economic competitiveness and robustness. It ensures places have a unique offer so that they draw on a particular segment of the market and locally-specific strengths and opportunities, whilst addressing locally-specific weaknesses and threats, creating a borough that is stronger as a whole. This is why clear visions for places based on an analysis of character are important, recognising the need to address their coherence with a view to reinforcing or creating positive identities – again a key issue in Newham. \n",

This policy therefore has an important role in achieving the Plan’s overarching objective of creating high quality places and delivery of resilience and convergence of outcomes. The health status of Newham’s residents is, in general, worse than the London average due to a higher mortality rate from circulatory diseases and diabetes, lower than London average life expectancy, poor cancer survival rates and high incidence of respiratory illnesses and mental health problems. Newham suffers from poor air quality and fails to meet national air quality standards, which impacts on human health particularly the old, the young and those with existing lung and heart conditions. Newham also has one of the highest rates of physically-inactive adults and one of the highest rates of obese children in London. Limiting long-term illnesses are also prominent within the population. There is an urgent need to improve people’s diets and physical activity rates, reduce stress levels, exposure to environmental pollutants and ensure that everyone can enjoy opportunities on offer, whatever their ability. \n",

The cumulative impact map of the borough in respect of hot food takeaways shows extensive areas of saturation (see SP9 and associated evidence base). Planning has come forward as an important agent in tackling the number of hot food takeaways in Newham by controlling their spatial distribution so minimising their impact on public health particularly in relation to schoolchildren. Young people’s access to such food, and the dietary patterns with health consequences that are established at a young age are an acknowledged concern at national level. \n",

This is one of the overarching objectives of the Local Plan, in addition to good design that supports the other objectives of optimising development and delivering growth. It is widely acknowledged that good design is the basis of successful regeneration initiatives. A robust, comprehensive and locally-specific design policy which applies to all scales and types of applications (including advertisements, telecoms and householders) is vital in this context given that despite support for good design at national, London-wide and local policy level, amongst some better and award-winning schemes in Newham, poorly conceived ones also continue to be put forward. Moreover, research\n",
      "1 \n",
      "shows that the cost of good design is minimal compared to the financial and other benefits that can be achieved through it. Importantly, good urban design comprises attention to a number of components: not just individual buildings, but also the spaces around them, the relationship with the surrounding area and connections between them, and the mix of uses provided for (which in turn impacts on those spaces). As such the policy emphasises that it is insufficient to address only certain aspects of design: it is expected that all aspects will be addressed, and carried through into credible plans for implementation and management. \n",
      "2.29 Good design must encompass the balance and configuration of uses and connections \n",
      "in an area with implications for accessibility and travel time, road safety and efficiency, efficiency of land use and management of flood risk, flexibility over time, activation of spaces, safety and security, legibility, amenity and attractiveness. It is thus vital that design initiatives are considered on an area basis rather than a singular building or plot basis, in order that cumulative impact on these matters are properly considered, and that land uses are configured to best strategic effect. Failure to do so can erode legibility and is often unsuccessful, as reflected in the numerous poorly located and frequently vacant ground floor commercial premises in Newham, creating inactive frontage and hostile street level environments, and concern about congregations of unmitigated ‘bad neighbour’ uses, notably takeaways and bars (See SP9). Good design requires careful strategic planning in order to balance noise-sensitive uses and viable but noisy industry, and to address flood risk – so that responses (e.g. elevated ground floors) do not cause problems of their own (e.g. inactive frontage). Temporal considerations may also apply – ensuring that development plots or premises that are vacant awaiting construction or occupation are activated through ‘meanwhile’ uses that bridge the gap to longer-term visions. \n",

      "paragraphs of this policy are considered to be strategic policies with which a neighbourhood plan should conform: 1. Strategic Principles; 2. Spatial Strategy.\n",
      "Justification \n",
      "2.38 T all buildings are defined in the London Plan as those that are noticeably taller than their \n",
      "immediate surroundings, and/or have a significant impact on the skyline. Tall buildings in Newham can therefore mean anything up to and beyond 25 storeys – buildings of this height are to be found in Stratford and Canning Town town centre. Elsewhere, in much of established Urban Newham, 5 storeys may be considered tall, though in most cases in the Arc of Opportunity 8-12 storeys would be the typical established height in newer development. To ensure the application of this policy to all tall building proposals in Newham, however, a tall building is considered to be six or more storeys and all proposals containing buildings of this height should be assessed against it.\n",
      "2.39 Ther e are many positive aspects to tall buildings which make them an attractive development \n",
      "from several perspectives. Tall buildings can help create and distinguish high quality place-making which is one of the over-arching objectives of the Local Plan: they can be excellent works of architecture, and some of the best post-war examples are now statutorily listed. The introduction of a prominent visual feature into an existing townscape can change its character and appearance and present a better perceived ‘offer’ for the area to the rest of the borough and London. Tall buildings can thus be iconic buildings that define a strong sense of regeneration, economic vitality and status of place, creating new views and landmarks and helping to improve legibility by marking for instance, town centres and transport hubs.\n",
      "2.40 T all buildings also offer the opportunity to build to higher densities around public transport \n",
      "nodes/key routes and in town centres, helping to support their viability and vitality. They may accommodate significant numbers of new homes, and cross subsidise affordable housing, and employment-generating uses/community facilities in an intensely used and vibrant development that activates the surrounding area and makes new infrastructure viable. A tall building can offer flexibility between office, hotel and residential and other appropriate uses. They can also help secure the redevelopment of small sites with high land values, or sites which need to ‘give’ land to open space, view or route corridors or to buffer industrial uses, roads and rail infrastructure. This form of development therefore can help promote mixed use areas, mixed communities and aid growth, optimising development potential in light of local and strategic needs. \n",
      "2.41 Conversely , a poorly designed tall building may create an isolated mono-community with \n",
      "little social interaction within the building and with the wider community in the area. The economics of building a taller building with its higher service charges may not necessarily optimise the housing opportunities available to residents in the borough. There may also be problems of ‘ownership’ and intensity of use of communal areas if not designed in such as way as to secure communal responsibility and ensure durability. \n",
      "2.42 A principal failing with tall buildings can be a lack of understanding of the natur e of the \n",

      "shadowing and street pollution flushing effects will have implications for the amenity of those living or working in or around the buildings. Perhaps most importantly, a tall building if not in the right place and if not well designed including treatment of the surrounding public realm, will by virtue of its size and widespread visibility, seriously harm the qualities that people value about a place, disrupting rather than enhancing place character.\n",
      "2.43 Importantly however , many of these benefits can be achieved in buildings that are ‘taller’ \n",
      "by just a few storeys than the prevailing height locally, but not necessarily ‘tall’ in the increasingly common sense of the word – 18-20 storeys plus. In addition, mid-rise development has less impact on surrounding dwellings, less overshadowing, and offers \n",
      "more opportunities for social interaction. As such, it is worthwhile to consider alternative \n",
      "ways of providing high density development, given that 2 to 4 storey combinations of \n",

      "housing mix and choice (including a greater proportion of family housing), and overall high \n",
      "quality housing with appropriate amenity space, are prominent themes. This is significant \n",
      "because research has shown that tall buildings with high child densities, and for where \n",
      "social housing forms a significant proportion of units, are more intensively used, and hence unless very carefully designed and managed, potentially less successful. Another consideration is that service charges in tall buildings, when not capitalised, can reduce \n",
      "affordability, particularly for shared ownership units. The emphasis in the local plan on \n",

These assets also have a role to play in achieving the other objectives of the Local Plan of delivering growth and optimising development. Starting with heritage, until recently traditionally this has to some extent been overlooked in Newham both by statutory agencies such as Historic England, and others responsible for change in the borough, from home owners through to large-scale developers. This is partly due to Newham’s relatively recent development when compared to some areas which means heritage assets have been seen as less significant than older ones elsewhere, and partly the inevitable result of incremental changes (with limited character-based direction) which add up to more significant ones. As such, Newham currently has relatively few Conservation Areas and listed buildings despite having a range of identifiable heritage features including many fine examples of Victorian and Edwardian buildings, docks and waterways. It also means that through neglect, distinctiveness has been eroded and the physical condition of some assets has  \n",

This policy therefore concerns existing and future Town and Local Centres as components of successful places in accordance with the overarching objectives of the Local Plan to create high quality places and successful communities and to optimise development. The need, particularly in the case of Town Centres, to be successful as economic places or destinations in their own right also promotes the other overarching Plan objective of delivering good growth, as measured by the degree of activation or vitality as well as commercial spending and competitiveness (viability) in line with national and London-wide policy. Whilst there will be differing expectations in terms of the scale of town (and likewise, District, Major and Metropolitan) as compared to Local Centres, over-arching ingredients of place quality for centres are applicable whatever the scale and function.

This includes ensuring that larger commercial uses do not create blank, inactive frontages, or over-large blocks which disrupt direct routes – indeed in many cases new development brings the opportunity to address past mistakes of this type.

This should draw in new customers who may undertake linked trips, extend activity into the evening, and generally encourage people to spend longer in a centre as more of their needs are met in one place.

      "Justification \n",
      "2.88 N ewham’s arterial street corridors form strategic linear gateways to and within the borough, \n",
      "making an important contribution to people’s impression of place and their perceptions of how attractive Newham is as a place to live, work and stay. The corridors have an important role to play in the overarching objective of the Local Plan to create high quality places. The arterial corridors are also important movement routes, for pedestrian, cycle and motor traffic including buses supporting the achievement of Good Growth. They link economically important centres and generally provide the shortest route ways between main centres of activity helping to deliver growth, and they provide locations for optimal development in the borough. \n",
      "2.89 The objective of seeking impr ovements in the quality of corridors sets out to reinforce \n",
      "both of these roles, particularly in relation to how they form people’s impression of routes towards central London and the local area. In doing so, the policy also seeks to reduce the linear ‘barrier’ effects felt by pedestrians and cyclists in particular, of major, often congested routes, and contribute to a lessening of congestion. Both barrier effects (connectivity) and congestion are noted to be key issues in the borough, congestion needing urgent attention due to the projected levels of new development in the borough and elsewhere. This has consequences for journey time and reliability, air quality, noise levels, the quality of the public realm, the health impacts of mode choice and people’s quality of life concerns, also noted by national and London-wide policy. \n",
      "2.90 Many measur es contribute towards the policy’s implementation in more than one of these \n",
      "dimensions. For example, making streets more pleasant places for people to use should encourage them out of their cars and into public spaces, which in turn helps to reduce traffic impacts and makes the area more liveable and more attractive generally. Animating streets and spaces by encouraging development with active frontages - windows and entrances, including appropriately-located community infrastructure, shops and street cafés - will also make streets safer and more interesting to use, particularly for pedestrians. Consolidating ribbon development into defined centres means that these destinations will be more clearly demarcated, reinforcing their viability, and tackling concerns about sprawling untidy frontages of mainly secondary retail, hot food takeaways and so on, which in stretching outside limited areas affect more people’s amenity. This means that where expansion of such uses or changes of use within those classes are proposed in these streets outside the areas and other designations (e.g. Protected Isolated Shops) identified in the relevant infrastructure (INF5) and Spatial Policies, (SP2, SP3) the policy position will be to encourage instead, relocation to in-centre locations, de-conversion to residential where Policies H1, H4 and INF8 can be satisfied, or if necessary, continuation of the status quo.\n",
      "2.91 Policies SP1, SP3 and SP5 establish the importance of key place-making and urban design  \n",

      "Newham Local Plan 2018 Newham Local Plan 2018buildings and spaces, sense of security and comfort. As well as activation and surveillance, \n",
      "key considerations include improving enclosure, and mitigation of environmental impacts of traffic. Improving enclosure by maintaining the building line has positive microclimate effects, as well as being visually pleasing (creating a more complete and coherent street composition), though care must be taken not to over-enclose by building heights and massing that are not in proportion to the street width. Mitigation of noise and air pollution impacts requires appropriate spacing, screening, and filtering (e.g. by trees) without compromising other design principles such as surveillance, and attention to character, heritage assets and sustainability. Other measures include ensuring properties are dual aspect, so can ventilate from the non-road facing side. \n",

      "Justification \n",
      "  \n",
      "3.1  It is expected that mor e jobs will be created in Newham, a Borough that has seen increases \n",
      "of a third in the numbers of economically active residents since 2010. It is estimated that during the plan period 39,000-60,000 jobs could be created in Newham, which is the highest of all neighbouring Boroughs with the exception of Tower Hamlets. \n",
      "3.2 In or der to help maximise growth potential and promote sustainable and quality employment \n",
      "that addresses the successful mixed use place, Convergence and Resilience agendas, the policy seeks to attract and retain investment from growth sectors such as culture, creative and visitor and evening economy, education and knowledge-led economy, hi-tech manufacturing, warehousing and logistics, construction and green enterprise, business and business services, building on Newham’s strong platform for economic growth. In doing so, the policy aims to capitalise on its excellent connectivity including with The City, Stratford, Canary Wharf and the West End and beyond, and providing for associated land, premises (including storage/yard space) and infrastructure requirements (including digital, energy, transport, work and social spaces). \n",
      "3.3  Ensuring that the supply of suitable employment land and pr emises is appropriately protected \n",
      "and newly provided for to meet emerging growth sectors will be a key component in maximising Newham’s economic strength and future investment, recognising that in the competition for land, this needs to be evidence-led, related to growth needs and not entirely speculative, and to work to achieve efficient use of land without undermining functionality. In this respect for instance, it is noted that independent budget hotel market provision is extensive relative to more luxury and quality assured (more than 2*) premises. Likewise, the Employment Land Review (ELR) Demand Assessment demonstrates that major office floorspace is more than well provided for within the pipeline, and at present is unlikely to be justifiable elsewhere in terms of likely beneficial occupation, though there is a gap in the market for smaller scale, more locally oriented offices. Similarly, whilst there is growth in the cultural and creative sector, and significant displacement pressures from increasingly expensive inner boroughs, its presence in Newham will need to be carefully curated rather than provided purely on the basis that ‘if we build it they will come’.\n",
      "3.4 In supporting the broad range of employment opportunities, the policy seeks to create high \n",
      "quality business environments that are supported by appropriate associated infrastructure (including digital, energy, social infrastructure and facilities) and delivered to meet the needs and requirements of existing and future businesses and their users. Promotion of diverse and flexible workspace allows response to changing business needs and creates robust, future-proofed places, including successful Town Centres and the promotion of local supply chain and local employment links; indeed, particular need has been identified for micro, social, small and medium enterprises, as well as larger ones, and a variety of ownership, lease and licence terms and prices\n",

      "Newham Local Plan 20183.5  Although, overall, the Council will be seeking a br oad range of employment opportunities, \n",
      "certain types of employment are considered to be more appropriate or likely to succeed in \n",
      "particular areas such as larger evening/night-time uses within Major or Metropolitan town centres, visitor accommodation in town centres or in employment hubs with particular visitor economy roles, cultural and creative in MBOAs and LMUAs, and major Office development in Stratford. This builds on locational advantages including agglomeration effects related to key use clusters, compatibility with the wider area, and the provision of appropriate infrastructure, such as the capacity of the transport network. Recognising significant areas of existing employment and identifying their future potential, the Council has therefore designated a number of Employment Hubs. These are mostly in the Arc of Opportunity, but also relate to other key employers and employment areas in Urban Newham, notably the \n",
      "Town Centres. In these, suitable employment uses will be encouraged, and in some cases \n",

      "3.16 The Review concludes that industrial development is viable thr oughout the Borough but \n",
      "there is strong demand for industrial space (including ‘last mile’ uses) across the Borough which is currently not being met. The ELR identifies that the Borough has a demand for at least 26 ha of industrial and warehousing land, (16 ha for warehousing / logistics including depot uses and 9 ha for industry including waste) with further requirements derived from displacement from its Strategic Sites and those elsewhere in inner London (notably Tower Hamlets) and that it has a reservoir of 42.52 ha to meet such need over the plan period, allowing for limited, Managed Release and consolidation of wharves, notably on some Strategic Sites, which are crucial to delivering the Council’s Spatial Vision (see spatial policies).\n",

      "specifically identified is seen to be ‘surplus’ to requirements, and even this will result in some displacement which will need to be re-accommodated in order to meet needs in the round, and ensure a net increase in employment. Likewise, some employment land is seen to be in relatively low intensity use, but this should not necessarily be regarded as ‘underused’, at least spatially, as in many cases this relates to operational requirements (e.g. yard space for large vehicles) though in some cases there may be scope to intensify its use temporally by introducing further shifts or other uses at certain times of the day (e.g. coach parking). \n",

Similarly, new workspace on other [parts of] Strategic Sites (notably Alpine Way S02, Connaught Riverside S23, North Woolwich Gateway S04, Lyle Park West S20) together with LMUAs, offer the opportunity to alleviate pressure and land demands on core industrial land, from uses or configurations of space that are more compatible with residential and help secure other benefits of a mixed use typology. It is also acknowledged that otherwise unallocated out of town retail parks in Beckton also offer some capacity of type, particularly where uses (e.g. car hire, open storage) may be more compatible with retail servicing and car parking. In turn, MBOAs, LMUAs and Strategic Sites present opportunities to develop smaller scale workspace (such as incubators, accelerators and co-working spaces) to accommodate the Borough’s buoyant levels of start ups or other businesses for whom affordability is an issue, and in residential areas, some very small scale workspace to support existing business needs may be acceptable. \n",

This has put particular pressure on space extensive uses such as open storage, and more affordable workspace. As with London as a whole, the plan-led Managed Release, Managed Transition and Managed Intensification approach is therefore vital to ensure that the Borough carefully manages its remaining stock and opportunity sites and overall transition to a mixed use borough to best effect. With such pressure on Newham’s industrial land, new development will be expected to demonstrate that employment-generating capacity consistent with the designation/spatial strategy has been maximised, not least through the provision of market relevant space, and that changes do not result in loss of functionality.  \n",

This is likely to involve support with site search and consideration of re-accommodation within the site or other sites within the landowner’s control locally.

It is however recognised that some industrial (including modernised) processes are inherently less neighbourly than others, and that one of the reasons for continuing to designate land as SIL is to concentrate these uses to better manage their impacts on overall development capacity. \n",
      "3.27  In r elation to wharves, there are two components of the wharf strategy (policies INF1 \n",

The first seeks the consolidation of four safeguarded wharves in Thameside West (Thames, Sunshine, Manhattan and Peruvian Wharves) on Central Thameside West (Peruvian and Royal Primrose Wharves) through Managed Intensification criteria (and appropriate development of associated Strategic Sites) requiring rationalisation and reduction of spatial impacts without net loss of capacity and functionality. This works with the Managed Release of associated SIL to ensure operational continuity for active wharf users. The second is the release of the two wharves at Canning Town Riverside (Mayer Parry and Priors Wharf) due to surplus capacity in the NE region. The Council will work with its partners including the PLA and GLA to realise this strategy and secure compliance with relevant London Plan policies. Jobs128\n",

In all cases it requires careful attention to the need of SIL and LIL uses on site, and how they could be intensified without compromising their operational functionality and overall capacity expectations on sites (relating to modelled demand for industrial and warehousing uses including transport, utilities and waste management) as set out in the Employment Land Review Part 2 (and any subsequent updates) and monitoring updates. \n",

Another possibility is temporal intensification, making use of ‘down time’ on other sites. Spatially it will also include actions such as enclosure of external storage, reducing off site impacts. Functionality considerations will include continued provision of adequate yard space, road access, ability to accommodate working patterns, wider ability to accommodate projected industrial/warehousing demand, (including a measure of cross-boundary displacement) in some cases due to impacts on adjacent SIL/LIL (e.g. due to potential access routes through the subject site).\n",

Their operation is intended to complement town centre and Key Corridor policies, recognising that in some locations consolidation of all commercial uses into town centres is challenging, and active ground floor uses and design/quality improvements may be beneficial to the wider street. In doing so, uses should not be of a scale that would cause town centre impacts and should be non-speculative, to avoid the potential for problematic ground floor voids as per SP3. \n",
      "3.31 Employment-led development is defined on the basis that employment needs (including  \n",
      "the viable operation of employment generating uses on the site and where relevant, adjacent sites) should be met first in any design, and then other uses such as residential are fitted around it. This will involve a design and market engagement exercise that establishes the optimum quantum and format of employment space (or in some cases supporting utilities infrastructure) that the site can sustain, and further design to ensure that other elements of the proposal do not prejudice the viable operation of such uses on the site and where relevant, adjacent sites, but also designing-in compatibility with residential and quality place-making.

Office space should be clearly ancillary to main industrial uses on a SIL or LIL, and in the case of childcare and training facilities, clearly linked to the employment functions.

      "4.1  The delivery of quality and varied new homes is essential to meeting Local Plan objectives  \n",
      "of providing for local and strategic needs arising from population and economic growth, \n",
      "in turn creating high quality, safe and secure places, with stable, mixed and balanced \n",
      "communities that work. Whilst Newham has a long history of welcoming new communities \n",
      "and benefits from a rich diversity, the high level of in-migration and the relatively cheap rents of East London that attract them have tended to be exploited by landlords who have created small [often sub-standard] flats and [often poor quality, over-crowded] HMOs in former \n",
      "family housing, reducing choice and eroding quality, with many people as a consequence \n",
      "passing through rather than setting down roots. This in turn has further affected community resilience and the extent to which people invest in improving their environment. Choice has also in the past been affected by smaller units dominating new-build supply, and quality by a failure of infrastructure investment to keep pace with growth, or in some cases, by poorly located housing. Quality in supply also becomes increasingly important with rising densities in order to compensate for intensity that comes with meeting housing need. \n",
      "4.2 Offering choice in housing through new quality supply (including that with specialist adaptations) \n",
      "is therefore vital to securing a successful, stable and inclusive place, ensuring housing supply can meet the differing needs of a diverse population and continue to do so throughout the course of their lives, as circumstances change, thereby reducing the need to move out and encouraging people to stay in the area, reducing churn and generating a resident population who have a strong stake in the borough’s future. This is covered by the various policy interventions including those introduced for Build to Rent accommodation, which as with other tenures, aim to ensure a viable rental offer that encompasses the kind of quality and security that will keep people in their homes, and in Newham for longer. In turn, housing quality in itself and as part of neighbourhoods where people have access to high quality amenities and good transport links due to appropriate infrastructure development, location of housing, and densities commensurate with accessibility, benefits health and well-being and economic development outcomes, supporting Convergence objectives. \n",
      "4.3 Ther efore, whilst with rising land prices there is a tendency by some developers to suggest \n",
      "that housing quality (notably space standards) should be compromised to achieve affordability, or housing numbers and densities should be prioritised over mix or locational considerations, this is not seen to be an appropriate path to take in light of these other objectives. It is noted for instance, that the infrastructure policies / identified infrastructure requirements of the Plan are linked to a projected level of delivery that accounts for these factors. Equally, it follows that, if a site is judged to be suitable for residential, it should be suitable for all families as much as smaller households, as per the existing situation in and around many of the Borough’s town centres. \n",
      "4.4 Notwithstanding the above, housing numbers ar e important, and Newham, given its high \n",
      "birth rate and levels of in-migration has a growing local need2, as well as the ability to \n",
      "accommodate strategic need beyond this due to the extent of development sites. The London Plan sets 10 year housing targets for all London boroughs, cognisant of both capacity and Pan-London need, with the aim of targets being met and exceeded between 2015 and 2025. The current target places a ‘general conformity’ commitment on Newham to provide 19,445 homes within this timeframe. However, the period of the Local Plan (2018 – 2033) requires consideration of housing delivery further into the future. \n",

Delivery of new homes ultimately, however, depends on such macro-economic factors affecting build rates.

      "ensuring stability that encourages people to live, work and stay in Newham, it is essential that the delivery of affordable housing continues to take place alongside that of market accommodation. As with the rest of London, demand for affordable housing is high and Newham already accounts for a large proportion of the future housing supply of London and the sub-region and has considerable needs of its own, both in terms of market and affordable housing need. Newham also has a high proportion of social housing compared with other areas of London. Bearing this in mind, and in the context of aspirations for the creation of mixed and balanced communities, policy seeks to add to the overall strategy by facilitating a range of accommodation that allows people to move between tenures and property size as their household and economic circumstances change. This means attempting to employ the use of a number of genuine affordable housing options, which include social rent, affordable rent and intermediate housing such as low cost home ownership products (see glossary for a definition of terms), to assist working people on low wages into their own home. It is considered that this will help stabilise communities and reduce churn, resulting in improved community cohesion. \n",
      "4.22  As with all London bor oughs, Newham is directed by the London Plan to provide an overall \n",
      "strategic affordable housing target in its Local Plan to meet local and strategic needs, and to seek the maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing when negotiating on individual private residential and mixed use schemes. Evidence points to a maximum strategic target of 50% of homes to be affordable during the plan period, based on Newham’s level of need and scheme viability. However, this level of provision may not be immediately achievable on all sites within Newham, therefore, recognising the variation in land values that already exists in different areas of the borough, as well as the potential for significant growth during the plan period that will impact such values, affordable housing is sought through a negotiation target that ranges between 35 and 50% of total units within a scheme. Within this stipulated range, in accordance with pan-London needs, the tenure split sought by policy is that 60% of units delivered are to be social housing (i.e. social rent or affordable rent or a combination of the two) and 40% are to be intermediate homes. Whilst it is accepted that unique circumstances may mean that some schemes will be unable to provide affordable housing within this range, varying scenarios have been modelled to consider different circumstances (including growth rates) over the entire plan period. Evidence indicates that 50% affordable housing is achievable on some schemes currently and it will become increasingly achievable on a greater number of sites throughout the next 15 years. Moreover, many schemes can achieve at least 35% at present, in some cases due to grant funding or other forms of subsidy including the off-siting of provision. For these reasons, this target range is considered to be robust provided it is applied flexibly on a case by case basis in accordance with policy H1. \n",

From 2001 to 2012 the proportion of flats in a converted dwelling doubled from 8.4% of total stock to 16.8%, whilst the overall proportion of all flats grew by 8%. There are now approximately 51,200 households in private rent (around half of the total housing stock) and a quarter of these are occupied as HMOs. These are evenly distributed throughout the borough, however some ‘hot spots’ are found in Stratford and West Ham, East Ham, Manor Park and Canning Town.

Moreover, concerns remain over the negative changes to the character of neighbourhoods resulting from converted homes that lack quality or are poorly maintained, inclusive of how such accommodation may support increased levels of transience, parking pressure and refuse generation, and the associated impact on the external environment and amenity. \n",

      "5.28  Flood risk is recognised as a major issue for London; around 15% of the Greater London \n",
      "area is identified as a higher risk flood zone (tidal and fluvial sources, Flood Zones 2 and 3). That proportion rises to over 50% in Newham where the rivers Thames, Roding, and Lea comprise the southern, western, and eastern boundaries of the Borough. The history of development in East London also means that most growth areas within the Borough fall within those higher risk zones (i.e. the Arc of Opportunity, largely previously industrial land). Given the myriad benefits of growth and development, the need to meet national and regional growth targets, confirmation in national and regional policy that Local Planning Authorities must respond to the risks of flooding (NPPF 102-104 and London Plan 5.12-5.13) and local residents’ concern around the frequency and severity of street flooding, this policy seeks to ensure that development of all scales and in all locations is contributing to an overall reduction in flood risk. As such, this policy contributes to most plan objectives as reducing flood risk through new development benefits the wider area (objective 1); the avoidance and minimisation of flooding is a key facet of high quality places in which people feel safe and secure (objective 2); and requirements ensure run-off is not harmful to / at the expense of the environment (objective 3).\n",

      "and as flooding can arise from a wide range of sources, (tidal, fluvial, pluvial, groundwater, sewer overflow and reservoir failure) all development can contribute to reducing flood risk even where that need may not be immediately apparent. Climate change science means we know that rainfall and the likelihood of extreme weather events will increase, and cumulative impact thinking demands that all scales of development contribute to improved resilience. The need to improve surface water drainage and become more resilient to flood damage ties into the wider Resilience agenda and is acutely important in an area with above-average levels of deprivation and rented accommodation (i.e. where individual and community-wide economic resilience to withstand and recover from flood damage will be lacking).\n",

Newham’s ongoing regeneration (including its convergence with neighbouring Borough’s and with London as a whole) and its attractiveness for inward economic investment, are dependent to a large degree upon excellent strategic accessibility, and the ongoing ability to safely and easily move goods and people around the Borough and beyond without delay. Substantial investment has already taken place in recent years, including Elizabeth Line access at five stations (due to open in 2020), improvements to the Borough’s Tube service (including night tube on the Jubilee Line), the introduction of Cycle Superhighways and creation of the Leaway, and substantial capacity enhancements, rolling stock renewal and extensions of the Docklands Light Railway. Significant investment is also underway in re-modelling the Stratford Gyratory, upgrading the Greenway, further Leaway connections, and to improve passenger handling capability at London City Airport. \n",

However, it is also the case that strategic transport investment is not without negative impacts, which can include noise and disturbance, deterioration of air quality, the creation of new barriers and land blight particularly during protracted safeguarding periods, opportunity costs (e.g. other potential land uses/forms of place-making) and increased journey times for some, affecting residents, businesses and wider regeneration and development potential. These need to be acknowledged, addressed as far as possible at the design stage, preferably designing them out or at least mitigating them, and where persisting after this, carefully assessed and weighed up in assessing the acceptability of a scheme. Equally however, as per ‘Agent of Change’ principles, the policy acknowledges that other new development may bring land use conflicts with existing transport infrastructure, and as such needs to be designed to ensure that these are adequately mitigated and do not impinge on the safe and viable operation of strategic transport links.\n",

Support will also be given to other, currently unfunded, strategic transport proposals that will contribute towards Newham’s regeneration and economic and physical development.

If growth expectations are to be met, utilities enhancements must also work in tandem with new development in an already heavily-urbanised area and minimise land take as well as other spatial and environmental impacts (including noise, smell, and visual intrusion).

Green infrastructure can enhance not only biodiversity and habitat provision, but also improve drainage capacity and reduce flooding, cool the urban environment (helping to reduce the urban heat island effect), contribute to local and historic character, tourism potential and visual amenity, and have both physical and mental health benefits, including through encouraging walking, cycling, and other leisure and recreation activities. The importance of green infrastructure has been highlighted by the creation of a Green Infrastructure Task Force for London and the resulting report ‘Natural Capital, Investing in a Green Infrastructure for London’, and its importance is recognised in London Plan\n",

      "Lea, and Roding as well as the Royal Docks. The BRN is a similar form of, and in some cases overlaps with, [green] infrastructure, performing an equivalent variety of roles (environmental and social) and therefore worthy of the same protection and enhancement. \n",
      "6.82 The pr omotion and protection of green and blue infrastructure within this policy contributes \n",
      "to the delivery of high quality places people can enjoy living in, (plan objective 2) to ‘good growth’ by improving the environmental impacts of development (e.g. through drainage enhancement, or the preservation of habitats), (objective 3) and to optimising the benefits of development for local people, ensuring green infrastructure is not functionally eroded and new provision is delivered (objective 1).\n",
      "6.83 Newham has an emerging ‘gr een grid’ but growth will inevitably mean increased pressure \n",
      "on green spaces and other forms of GI, both in the numbers of people wanting to access them and in competing demands on land use. Promotion and enhancement of the green grid is therefore encouraged, which will include improving connectivity to and between existing spaces and features as well as delivering new contributions. In doing so, the impact of green infrastructure interventions are enhanced, even when quantitative opportunities are limited. This is particularly the case in Urban Newham, which will also need to secure improved access to new and existing (in some cases inaccessible) larger green spaces in the Arc of Opportunity and in the east of the Borough to help address existing and emerging deficiencies. The Lea River Park is a project highlighted in the IDP of particular significance in this respect. Even without public access however, green chain links should be protected and promoted given benefits to biodiversity and health (research also shows that merely being able to see GI features such as trees can have health benefits).\n",

      "necessary infrastructure (physical, social and green; including affordable and specialist housing and mechanisms to connect people to job and business opportunities) to support them. However, this is not a responsibility that falls to the local authority in isolation. The development of infrastructure requires investment from a range of sources including healthcare providers, water and sewerage undertakers, national agencies, and developers. Where there is a substantial programme of development or regeneration, such as in Newham, there is a need for the investment strategies of the various agencies to be effectively coordinated through integrated infrastructure planning, and for growth (notably of housing, but also of employment space) to occur alongside the evolution of infrastructure. The ultimate objective is to ensure ‘good growth’ is achieved, maintaining and preferably enhancing quality of life, rather than resulting in unacceptable impacts and externalities. \n",
      "6.117  It is important for the Council and other infrastructure providers to have a firm grasp of \n",
      "the infrastructure needs of the future, and how they relate to existing plans of service providers to improve service delivery. The planning process provides a forum within which to align providers’ plans with expected population and household growth because it is important to identify any remaining funding gaps for infrastructure provision after these plans have been assessed and because there needs to be a sound basis for the infrastructure specified in site allocations and for the collection of developer contributions. \n",
      "6.118  The NPPF confirms that the Local Planning Authority should engage with authorities and \n",
      "providers to assess the quality and capacity of infrastructure for transport, water supply, wastewater and its treatment, energy (including heat), telecommunications, utilities, waste, health, social care, education, flood risk and coastal change management, and its ability to meet forecast demands. The outcome of such engagement, set out within the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) and reflected in the spatial and thematic policies demonstrates how the infrastructure needs arising from the strategy set out in the development plan will be met, including provision for managing ‘known unknowns’ which are the inevitable consequence of varying planning horizons and processes. As such the IDP has been embedded within policy to signpost to infrastructure providers, land owners and developers the full costs of delivering schemes in the Borough and the associated impact on demand/need for infrastructure and services. \n",
