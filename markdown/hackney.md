## Foreword

I  am  pleased  to  introduce  Hackney's  Local  Plan  2033  (LP33),  which  is  the  


Council's  spatial   planning   document. LP33  sets  ambitious  and  step-changing  policies  that  will  enable  the  delivery  of  


the  Borough's  Community  Strategy,  Hackney  A  Place  for  Everyone,  and  realise  

 


the  Council's  vision  for  a  fairer,  safer,  and  more  sustainable  Hackney.  It  links  and  

 

 
 
 
supports  the  delivery  of  the  Council's  portfolio  of  secondary  strategies,  and  sets  


out  a  physical  growth  strategy  and  an  approach  to  managing  land  uses,  


alongside   Planning   policies   and   Planning   guidance   for   the   Borough. LP33  will  be  used  as  the  main  policy  tool  to  assess  and  determine  planning  


applications  across  the  Borough.  It  will  support  the  on-going  regeneration  of  the  

 


Borough,  and  provide  greater  certainty  to  all  who  may  wish  to  bring  forward  


development,  our  communities'  objectives  and  ambitions,  and  how  building  in  


our   borough   can   align   with   those   objectives. LP33  and  the  Policies  Map  replaces  Hackney's  Core  Strategy  (2010),  


Development  Management  Local  Plan  (2015),  Site  Allocations  Local  Plan  (2016),  


and  the  Area  Actions  Plans  for  Dalston,  Hackney  Central  and  Manor  House.  


LP33  identities  the  key  areas  of  growth,  and  sets  strategic  and  detailed  policies  


on:   
  
  
  

●
delivering  high  quality  urban  neighbourhoods  with  distinctive  architectural  


quality,  which  respect  Hackney's  built  heritage  and  celebrate  the  


contemporary;  
 
●
tackling  health  inequalities,  create  a  child  friendly  friendly  borough,  and  an  

 


inclusive   and   accessible   environment;  
 
●
supporting  a  diverse,  mixed  and  resilient  economy,  and  a  distinctive  


network   of   town   centres   and   neighbourhoods;  
 
●
protecting  and  delivering  more  appropriate  housing,  and  genuinely  


affordable   housing;  
 
●
providing,  protecting  and  enhancing  open  space,  biodiversity  and  green  


links   between   areas;  
 
●
delivering   adequate   supporting   community   and   utility   infrastructure;  
 
●
promoting   sustainable   transport   networks   and   public   realm;  
 
●
becoming  a  low  carbon  and  carbon  resilient  borough,  improving  local  air  
  


quality   and   developing   to   counter   the   urban   heat   island   effect.  
 
 LP33  should  be  read  alongside  the  new  London  Plan;  at  the  time  of  writing  the  


new  London  Plan  is  still  to  be  formally  adopted  however,  on  adoption  it  will  

 
 
provide  the  important  London-wide  context.  Our  LP33  has  been  developed  in  


parallel   with   the   new   London   Plan   and   both   are   aligned. Work  is  already  well  underway  to  ensure  the  successful  delivery  and  monitoring  
  


of   the   Plan's  Growth   Strategy   and   policies.   This   includes:  

●
the  development  of  area-based  plans  for  those  areas  in  the  Borough  that  


will   see   the   most   significant   growth   or   sensitivity   to   change.   
  
●
the  production  of  topic-based  Supplementary  Planning  Documents  


(SPDs)  to  provide  further  guidance  on  the  new  policy  approach  set  out  in  

 
LP33.  
 
●
update  of  the  borough-wide  Infrastructure  Delivery  Plan  to  support  the  


emerging   area-based   plans.   
  
●
the  effectiveness  of  the  LP33  policies  will  continue  to  be  monitored  on  an  


annual   basis   through   the   Council's  Authority   Monitoring   Report. LP33  demonstrates  the  importance  of  Planning  and  its  role  in  anticipating  the  


growth  of  our  borough,  its  population  and  its  economy;  in  shaping  the  physicality  

 


of  the  Borough  and  ensuring  that  it  enhances  its  reputation  as  a  great  place  to 

 

 


live,  learn,  work  and  to  visit;  and  identifying  where  places  and  spaces  can  be  


enjoyed   by   all   our   communities   and   where   everyone   can   belong.  

 

 
Councillor   Guy   Nicholson,  
 
Cabinet   Member   for   Planning,   Culture   and   Inclusive   Economy  
 

## 1 Introduction 1. Introduction

1.1 Hackney's  Local  Plan  (LP33)  sets  out  the  Council's  growth  strategy  and  an  


approach  to  managing  land  uses,  alongside  planning  policies  and  planning  


guidance  for  places  and  neighbourhoods.  The  Plan  covers  the  period  2018  to  


2033,  and  it  will  direct  development  and  investment  in  the  Borough  and  help  to  
 
  

 


shape   regeneration   plans   for   neighbourhoods.  


1.2 Planning  policies  are  set  out  within  the  Plan  in  defined  boxes  and  are  


referenced  PP1-PP10  (Chapter  4) 
 and  LP1-LP58  (Chapters  5-12). 
 Site  


allocation  policies  are  defined  in  Chapter  13  and  are  referenced  as  MH1-MH3,  


HC1-15,   D1-D10,   CL1,   CLD1,   SHX1-SHX3.  


1.3 A  Local  Plan  contains  both  strategic  and  non  strategic  policies.  Strategic  


policies  are  those  that  are  necessary  to  address  the  strategic  priorities  of  an  


area,  covermatters  that  cross  administrative  boundaries,  and  involve  on-going  


joint  working  with  the  GLA, 
 other  local  authorities,  organisations  and  


communities. 
 All  the  policies  within  LP33  are  considered  strategic  in  


accordance   with   national   policy.   
  
 
 
1.4 LP33  sets  out  to  ensure  that  new  development  serves  the  needs  of  the  


community,  making  sure  that  the  right  development  is  built  in  the  right  place,  


that  growth  is  managed  in  a  thoughtful  and  considered  way  and  that  the  


Council   realises   its  vision   for   a   fairer,   safer   and   more   sustainable   Hackney.   
  
 
 
1.5 Once  adopted,  LP33  will  replace  the  Core  Strategy  (2010),  Development  


Management  Local  Plan  (2015),  Hackney  Central  AAP  (2012),  Dalston  AAP  


(2013)  and  Manor  House  AAP  (2013).  LP33  also  replaces  certain  allocations 


set  out  in  the  Site  Allocations  Local  Plan  (2016).  The  policies  and  site  


allocations  replaced  are  detailed  in  Appendix  3.  It  is  the  Council's  key  strategic  

  


planning   document,   and   will   sit  alongside:   
  
 
 
●
The  London  Plan  -  this  is  the  Mayor's  strategic  plan  for  Greater  London  

 
  


as  a  whole.  It  sets  out  an  integrated  economic,  environmental,  transport  
  
  


and  social  framework  for  the  city,  including  borough  level  housing  targets  


and  identifies  areas  for  future  growth  of  strategic  importance.  The  Local  


Plan  and  other  development  plans  need  to  be  in  general  conformity  with  


the  London  Plan.  A  new  London  Plan  was  published  for  consultation  in  

 


December   2017   and   the   Examination   in   Public    took   place   in   2019.   The   
  
 
 
Inspectors'  Panel  report  was  published  in  2019,  and  the  Mayor  produced  a  

 

 
London  Plan  `Intend  to  publish'  version  in  December  2019.  As  of  April  


2020,  the  Greater  London  Authority  and  Government  are  in  discussions  


regarding   the   new   London   Plan. 

  

●
Area  Action  Plans  (AAP)  -  the  Council  is  preparing  two  new  AAPs  for  

 


Shoreditch  and  Stamford  Hill.  These  documents  will  provide  guidance  to  


help  shape  and  co-ordinate  development  proposals  in  these  key  growth  


areas.    Both   plans   will   identify   key   development   sites   in   their   areas.  
 
●
Masterplans  /  Supplementary  Planning  Documents  -  this  includes  the  
  


Hackney  Central  Masterplan  (2017)  which  sets  out  development  principles  


and  detailed  guidance  for  identified  opportunity  sites  in  the  area.  More  


detailed   plans   will   be   produced   for   Dalston,   Clapton   and   Homerton.  
 
●
North  London  Waste  Plan  -  this  is  being  prepared  jointly  by  seven  North  

 


London  boroughs.  It  will  identify  a  range  of  suitable  sites  for  the  


management  of  all  North  London's  waste  up  to  2031  and  will  include  


policies   and   guidelines   for   determining   planning   applications   for   waste.  
 

## This  Document

1.6 The  Examination  in  Public  was  held  on  Hackney's  Local  Plan  2033  in  the  


summer  of  2019,  and  following  the  Planning  Inspector's  report,  LP33  was  


adopted   by   full   Council   on   22nd   July   2020.  


1.7 The  document  contains  four  parts:  part  one  sets  out  the  vision  for  Hackney  in  


2033,  alongside  the  objectives,  growth  strategy  and  place  policies;  part  two  sets  


out  policies  for  different  topics;  part  three  allocates  sites  for  different  types  of  


development;  and  part  four  provides  further  information  on  how  the  plan  will  be  


delivered.

## 2 Challenges And Opportunities 2. Challenges   And   Opportunities

2.1 LP33  responds  to  new  challenges  and  opportunities  facing  the  Borough  many  of  


which  have  been  identified  through  extensive  community  engagement  to  


develop  a  new  Community  Strategy  for  the  Borough  -  Hackney  A  Place  for  

 


Everyone,   as   well   as   the   more   formal   stages   of   consultation   for   LP33.  


2.2 Hackney's  population  has  continued  to  grow  significantly;  at  the  present  rate  of  


growth  the  population  will  reach  around  320,000  by  2033,  a  growth  of  45,000  

 


since  2016.  This  will  result  in  a  need  for  more  homes,  jobs,  services  and  


community  facilities  such  as  schools  and  health  care.  Affordability  is  the  top  


issue  of  concern  for  our  residents.  The  average  home  now  costs  17  times  the  


average  salary  in  the  Borough.  Affordable  workspace  is  also  in  demand  with  


average   commercial   rents   increasing   by   90%   since   2009.  


2.3 Our  existing  strategic  policies  were  prepared  at  the  time  of  the  economic  


recession  and  Hackney  has  since  experienced  a  period  of  sustained  economic  

 


growth.  There  is  therefore  competing  demand  for  the  use  of  land  including  for  


economic  and  housing  purposes.  For  policies  to  be  robust  they  must  reflect  the  


current  economic  climate  and  be  able  to  respond  to  future  economic  cycles  


going  forward  to  2033,  taking  into  account  the  impact  of  Brexit.  In  addition  


growth  will  need  to  take  into  account  individual  sector's  space  and  area  


requirements.  The  growth  of  the  leisure  and  evening  economy  sectors  and  the  


growth  of  internet  shopping,  for  which  Hackney  has  above  average  use,  all  


present  challenges  and  have  an  impact  on  our  approach  to  managing  and  


diversifying   uses   in   our   high   streets   and   town   centres.  


2.4 Investment  and  policy  decisions,  nationally  and  in  London  also  provide  


challenges  and  opportunities  for  the  Plan.  There  have  been  significant  changes  


to  legislation  and  national  policy  since  we  last  produced  strategic  planning  


policies.  These  include  the  Housing  and  Planning  Act,  revisions  to  the  National  


Planning  Policy  Framework  and  Practice  Guidance.  We  have  also  seen  the  


introduction  of  Community  Infrastructure  Levy  (CIL)  which  could  be  reformed  


further  throughout  the  plan  period.  There  have  also  been  extensive  and  wide  


ranging   changes   to   permitted   development   rights.  


2.5 Hackney  will  continue  to  work  with  the  Mayor  of  London  and  Greater  London  


Authority  to  develop  a  shared  vision  and  strengthen  Hackney's  role  as  a  key  

 

 
 
component  of  London  as  a  World  City.  LP33  has  been  produced  alongside  the  

 


new  London  Plan  to  ensure  shared  evidence  is  used,  with  Hackney  helping  to  

 


shape   strategic   elements   of   the   new   London   Plan.  


2.6 As  part  of  current  proposals  for  Crossrail  2  a  new  station  would  be  provided  at  

  


Dalston,  which  could  be  operational  by  the  early  2030s.  There  may  be  further  


potential  for  an  eastern  branch  of  Crossrail  2,  with  stations  at  Hackney  Central  


and  Hackney  Wick.  These  transport  improvements  improve  capacity,  


accessibility  and  further  unlock  development  opportunities,  possibly  leading  to  


improvements  in  the  surrounding  area  including  the  public  realm.  Under-utilised  


land  owned  by  Transport  for  London  (TfL),  particularly  around  the  Lea  Bridge  


Roundabout  in  Clapton  could  also  offer  longer  term  opportunities  for  


development  and  investment.  Improvement  in  strategic  transport  infrastructure  


is   critical   for   sustainable   growth   and   placemaking.  


2.7 Climate  change  brings  challenges  both  in  terms  of  mitigation  and  in  the  need  to  

 


develop  resilience  to  increases  in  temperatures  and  flood  risk.  We  need  to  


maximise  opportunities  to  further  reduce  our  carbon  footprint  exploring  options  


for   decentralised   energy   networks   and   look   at   ways   to   reduce   urban   heat.  
 

## How  Much  Development  Is  Needed?

2.8 The  key  challenge  for  the  Plan  is  to  plan  for  growth  in  a  sustainable  way  that  

 


respects  the  built  and  natural  environment,  maximising  the  delivery  of  genuinely  


affordable  homes,  provides  necessary  community  facilities  and  supports  our  


economy   by   providing   new   jobs   for   Hackney   residents.   
  
  

## Vision

2.9 LP33  is  informed  by  a  vision  and  aspirations  for  Hackney  set  out  in  the  new  

 


Community   Strategy.  
 

## Our  Aspirations  For  Hackney  -  2033

We  have  protected  and  enhanced  the  unique,  welcoming  spirit  of  Hackney  


throughout  a  period  of  local  and  national  change  and  local  growth.  


Hackney  is  a  place  where  everyone  has  had  the  opportunity  to  benefit  from  
   


the  growth  the  Borough  has  seen  and  no  sections  of  the  community  feel  


left  behind.  The  impressive  improvement  in  our  schools  and  colleges  has  


been  maintained  and  they  continue  to  meet  our  residents'  high  aspirations  


for  education  -  valued  as  universal  hubs  for  the  community,  promoting  


social  inclusion  and  cohesion,  contributing  to  health  and  wellbeing  and  


helping  to  protect  and  improve  outcomes  for  children  and  young  people  


within  our  community.  Residents  have  access  to  decent,  stable  and  


genuinely  affordable  housing  that  meets  their  needs.  They  are  able  to  


secure  higher  quality,  more  stable  employment  in  a  range  of  sectors  across  

  


London. The  Borough  is  a  place  where  it  is  easy  to  get  business  done  -  we  are  

 
 
  

 
 
 
home  to  a  spectrum  of  businesses  of  different  sizes.  This  includes  small  
 
  


firms  who  provide  local  services  to  our  diverse  population,  as  well  as  


start-ups  and  large  companies  at  the  forefront  of  the  tech  sector.  There  is  a  

  
strong  sense  of  community  and  of  collaboration,  with  residents  and  


businesses  keen  to  share  their  time,  knowledge  and  skills  -  and  not  just  

 


within  their  own  local  networks.  The  Council  encourages  active  citizenship  


and  inclusive  decision  making  is  honest  and  respectful  with  residents  about  

 


the  tough  decisions  that  it  has  to  take  in  a  world  where  public  finances  

 

 


continue  to  be  stretched,  and  core  services  must  be  delivered  differently.  


Despite  public  resources  being  limited,  there  is  a  focus  on  keeping  the  

 


most  vulnerable  residents  in  our  communities  safe  and  well,  and  on  


approaches  which  are  preventative.  Protecting  and  supporting  the  most  


vulnerable  in  our  communities  is  seen  as  everyone's  concern  rather  than  


just   the   role   of   the   public   sector. Our  creative,  welcoming  community  continues  to  be  recognised  for  the  


depth  and  breadth  of  its  diversity,  in  terms  of  cultural  background,  


experience,  skills  and  perspectives.  Hackney  is  an  outward-looking  and  


well-networked  borough,  working  with  partners  across  London's  industries  


to  contribute  to  and  benefit  from  the  capital's  wider  prosperity  and  


innovation.  The  Council  has  put  sustainability  and  quality  of  life  at  the  heart  


of  urban  design.  Local  businesses  and  residents  are  equally  concerned  


and  committed  to  being  environmentally  sustainable  with  everyone  taking  


pride  in  their  local  area  and  responsibility  for  taking  care  of  it  for  the  benefit  

 


of  all.  We  have  tackled  institutional  barriers  to  create  healthy  and  safe  


streets  and  neighbourhoods,  which  are  pedestrian  -  and  cyclist-friendly  and  

 


ensure  fair  and  easy  access  to  green  spaces.  People  are  living  longer,  


healthier,  happier  and  more  independent  lives.  They  take  responsibility  for  


maintaining  their  wellbeing  throughout  their  lives,  but  when  people  do  need  


support,  it  is  joined  up  and  appropriate,  taking  a  view  of  all  their  needs  in  
  

 


the   round.   
  

## Objectives

2.10 The  following  spatial  objectives  emerged  from  the  Community  Strategy  vision  


and   set   the   framework   for   the   future   growth   strategy   and   new   planning   policies.  


1. To 
 deliver 
 high 
 quality 
 urban  neighbourhoods  with  distinctive  


architectural  quality  which  respects  Hackney's  historic  character  whilst  


producing  unique  and  innovative  contemporary  design  that  reflects  


Hackney's  innovative   and   creative   culture.  
 
2. To   tackle   health   inequalities,   create   a   child   friendly   borough   and   an   
inclusive   environment   that   promotes   good   health   and   wellbeing   and enables   skill   development   and lifelong   learning   for   all.   
  
3. To  deliver  26,250  additional  homes,  increasing  the  supply  of  genuinely  


affordable  homes,  alongside  community  facilities  to  meet  existing  and  


future   needs.  
 
4. To  support  a  diverse  and  mixed  economy  providing  at  least  23,000  new  
 
  


jobs  across  a  range  of  sectors  by  2033  and  maximise  the  supply  of  


affordable   workspace   and   low   cost   industrial   space.  
 
5. To  support  distinctive  town  centres  and  a  vibrant  town  centre  


experience.  Evidence  indicates  that  there  will  be  a  requirement  of  


approximately   34,000sqm   of   new   retail   and   leisure   floorspace   by   2033.  
 
6. To  create  liveable  and  accessible  neighbourhoods  where  people  choose  


to  walk,  cycle  and  socialise,  and  support  the  development  of  a  network  

 
 
for   electric   vehicles.  
 
7. To  support  improvements  to  the  public  transport  network  and  maximise  


the  community  and  regeneration  benefits  and  opportunities  to  come  


from  Crossrail   2.  
 
8. To  protect  and  enhance  existing  open  spaces  and  biodiversity,  develop  


and  improve  green  links  between  these  spaces  and  support  the  creation  


of   new   and   open   spaces   and   vertical   gardens.  
 
9. To  become  a  low  carbon  and  carbon-resilient  borough  realising  


significant  improvements  to  air  quality  and  reducing  the  urban  heat  


island   effect   within   the   Borough.  
 

## Growth Strategy 3 3.    Growth   Strategy Delivering  Sustainable  Growth

3.1 The  Council  will  create  the  conditions  for  growth  to  deliver  up  to  26,250  new  


homes,  increasing  the  supply  of  genuinely  affordable  homes,  alongside  


community  facilities  through  high  quality  urban  neighbourhoods,  to  meet  


Hackney's  needs.  Development  for  all  uses  will  be  innovative,  designed  to  a  

 
high  architectural  standard  whilst  reflecting  historic  character.  The  most  


significant   growth   is   planned   in   the   following   locations.  
 

## Town  Centres,  High  Streets  And  Employment  Hubs

3.2 Mixed  use  development  with  residential,  employment,  retail,  leisure,  community,  


arts  and  cultural  facilities  including  those  catering  predominately  for  the  evening  


economy  will  be  focused  in  the  designated  town  centres  of  Dalston  and  


Hackney  Central,  and  in  Shoreditch.  We  will  plan  for  34,000sqm  of  new  retail  


and  leisure  by  2033,  which  will  be  mainly  directed  towards  the  main  town  


centres.  


3.3 Hackney  Central  will  have  an  enhanced  and  strengthened  role  as  the  Borough's  


major  civic  and  cultural  hub  providing  new  homes  and  jobs,  and  new  retail  and  


commercial  floorspace  along  Morning  Lane  with  improved  links  through  to  


shopping   along   the   Narrow   Way.  


3.4 The  arrival  of  Crossrail  2  in  the  2030s  will  further  enhance  Dalston's  role  as  the  

 


Borough's  other  major  centre.  Its  arrival  will  support  opportunities  for  significant  


growth  in  the  area,  which  through  careful  and  considered  masterplanning,  will  


be  managed  to  ensure  Dalston's  unique  creative  and  cultural  character  is  


maintained  and  enhanced,  alongside  the  delivery  of  new  homes,  jobs  and  


improved   retail   facilities.  


3.5 Employment  areas  within  and  outside  of  town  centres  will  continue  to  be  


designated  and  protected  for  employment-led  development,  with  intensification  


delivering  117,000sqm  of  new  business  floorspace.  Existing  industrial  land  


maker  space  will  be  safeguarded  and  intensified,  to  support  a  flexible,  diverse,  

 
 
 
adaptable   and   sustainable   economy.  


3.6 New  office  development  will  be  directed  to  the  most  sustainable  locations  in  the 

 
 
Borough,  including  within  the  City  Fringe  Opportunity  Area  and  the  Borough's  


Town  Centres  to  support  Hackney's  national  and  international  economy.  


Shoreditch  and  the  Central  Activity  Zone  (CAZ)  in  general  will  continue  to  thrive  


and  be  recognised  internationally  for  Tech  City:  employment,  retail,  and  leisure  


uses  will  be  supplemented  with  a  growth  in  cultural  industry  driven  by  its  rich  

 


theatrical  heritage.  An  Area  Action  Plan  (AAP)  for  Shoreditch  will  guide  this  


growth.  
 

## Enhanced  Corridors,  Lea  Valley  Edge  And  A  New  Centre  At Clapton

3.7 Mixed-used,  housing  led  development  will  be  encouraged  along  the  Borough's  


main  transport  corridors  to  deliver  improvements  to  the  public  realm,  new  


community  facilities  and  other  measures  that  promote healthy  streets  and  that  


easily  link  different  neighbourhoods,  open  spaces,  public  transport  hubs,  and  


civic  areas  by  walking  and  cycling. The  use  of  space  above  existing  buildings  to  


deliver  more  homes  will  be  encouraged.  There  will  be  more  detailed  plans  to  


guide  development  and  growth  of  some  of  the  town  centres  and  areas  within  the  


enhanced   corridor   areas.   
  
 
 
3.8 A  boroughwide  Characterisation  Study  has  identified  locations  for  renewal  and  


intensification  enabling  higher  density  development  to  deliver  new  homes  in  a  

 
way  that  enhances  positive  local  character  and  the  historic  environment.  Key  


areas   for   focus   include:  


●
Kingsland   Road:    Stamford   Hill   -   Stoke   Newington   -   Dalston   -   Shoreditch.  
 
●
Clapton  Road  and  Mare  Street:   Stamford  Hill  -  Clapton  -  Hackney  Central  

 
  
 
 
-   Shoreditch   via   Hackney   Road.  
 
●
Homerton:   Dalston  -  Homerton  -  Hackney  Wick  -  Stratford  -  with  growth  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
supported  by  improved  transport  links  including  a  potential  eastern  branch  

 


to   Crossrail   2   and   enhanced   Overground   stations.  
 
●
Previously  developed  land  along  the  Lea  Valley  Edge  -  making  best  use  of  

 


the  setting  next  to  the  River  Lea  and  enhancing  access  to  the  Lee  Valley  


Regional   Park.  
 
●
A  new  centre  at  Clapton  will  be  created  through  mixed  use  development  


connecting  Upper  and  Lower  Clapton  Road  through  remodelling  of  the  Lea  


Bridge   roundabout. 

  

 
3.9 In  the  north  of  the  Borough,  development  will  respond  to  the  specific  needs  arising  


from  larger  families  in  the  Stamford  Hill  area.   An  AAP  will  help  deliver  new  homes  


with  a  particular  focus  on  housing  for  large  families,  older  people  and  single  


people,  community  facilities,  jobs  and  workspace.  It  will  build  upon  the  area's  


distinctive  local  character  and  shopping  centres,  celebrate  its  diverse  community  


and  seek  to  enhance  its  architectural  and  landscape  merits  through  an  approach  


that  promotes  positive  change  and  will  maximise  the  use  of  undeveloped  sites.  


The  area  will  have  better  connected  neighbourhoods,  accessible  by  walking  and  


cycling,  which  are  designed  around  communities'  specific  residential,  civic  and  


economic   needs.  
 
  
3.10 Stamford  Hill's  importance  as  a  district  centre  and  cultural  centre  serving  the  


communities  in  the  north  of  the  Borough  will  be  recognised  and  enhanced.  The  


next  phases  of  the  redevelopment  of  Woodberry  Down  will  continue  to  progress  


towards  completion  and  developments  along  Seven  Sisters  Road  and  Green  


Lanes  junction  in  Manor  House  will  provide  new  homes  and  commercial  uses  with  


active  frontages  at  the  street  level   enhancing   this  gateway   to  the  Borough.

## Places For People

4 

## 4.    Places   For   People

4.1 To  deliver  our  vision  for  Hackney  in  2033  we  have  developed  a  series  of  place  

 


policies.  Place  policies  provide  the  strategic  guidance  for  the  Council  to  develop  


the   area   based   plans    and   guide   new   development   in   these   areas. 1.
Dalston   
  
2.
Hackney   Central   and   Surrounds  
 
3.
Stamford   Hill   
  
4.
Enhanced   Corridors   
  
5.
Hackney   Wick   
  
6.
Clapton   and   Lea   Bridge   Roundabout   
  
7.
Shoreditch   and   Hoxton  
 
8.
Manor   House   
  
9.
Homerton   
  
 
 
4.2 The  place  policies  set  out  an  area  vision,  an  overview  of  the  urban  character  


taken  from  the  boroughwide  Characterisation  Study,  urban  design  analysis,  


development  principles,  land  use  designations  and  development  opportunities.  


The  place  policies  sit  alongside  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  


borough   wide   policy   on    public   realm   (PP1).  

## Public  Realm

4.3 The  public  space  around,  between  and  within  buildings,  streets,  squares,  parks  


and  open  spaces  all  support  public  life  and  social  interaction.  Hackney's  public  


spaces  are  key  to  creating  a  sense  of  place  and  play  an  important  role  in  


enhancing  communities'  quality  of  life  and  health  and  wellbeing  and  can  even  


play  a  role  in  boosting  the  local  economy.  Our  streets,  the  space  between  the  
  


buildings,  must  become  public  space  for  public  life.  These  spaces  are  used  by  


everyone  for  movement,  for  work,  for  play  and  for  simply  watching  the  world  go  


by  in  the  great  outdoors  and,  as  we  look  ahead  to  an  intensified  Hackney  with  a  

 
higher   population,   they   become   even   more   important.   
  
 
 
4.4 All  new  development  should,  where  appropriate,  meet  the  criteria  set  out  in  


PP1.  PP1  will  also,  alongside  the  specific  place  policies  (PP2  -  PP10),  help  

 
 
 
guide   future   AAPs   and   masterplans. 
  

## Pp1  -  Public  Realm

Public  realm  improvements  and  spaces  between  buildings  must  be  


considered  as  part  of  all  development  schemes.  Where  appropriate,  


development   should:  
 

i. Integrate  new  and  existing  public  realm:  improving  the  quality  and  


function  of  existing  routes;  creating  well-defined  streets  and  open  


spaces;  and  taking  advantage  of  existing  topography  and  landscape  


features;  
 
ii. Create  wide,  clear  and  level  pavements  and  avoid  unnecessary  street  


clutter;  
 
iii. Provide  landscaping,  planting,  seating,  drinking  water  fountains,  shade  


and  shelter,  street  lighting  and  signage  -  incorporating  these  into  the  

 


frontage   of   a   building   where   possible;  
 
iv. Make  it  easy  for  people  to  find  their  way  around,  by  marking  focal  
  


points   and   accesses   to   buildings   and   open   spaces;  
 
v. Provide  safe  building  entrances  and  exits  and  appropriately  designed  


lighting   and   security   features   as   an   integral   part   of   the   development;  
 
vi. Create  multi-functional  shared  public  space  for  users  of  all  ages,  


allowing  opportunity  for  informal  play  and  recreation  as  well  as  for  


sitting   and   lingering.  
 

## Pp2   Dalston Vision

4.5 Dalston  will  remain  a  unique  place  to  live,  work  and  visit. 
 A  long-term,  


sustainable  future  for  the  town  centre  will  be  developed  through  careful  and  


considered  engagement  with  the  community.  This  process  will  ensure  that  the  


creative,  cultural  and  social  organisations  that  give  the  town  centre  its  distinctive  


identity  will  be  sustained  alongside  the  delivery  of  new  homes,  jobs  and  


improved  retail  facilities.  Opportunities  to  extend  and  improve  Dalston's  public  


realm,  green  and  public  open  spaces  will  be  explored  with  possible  new  


pedestrian  links  created  in  order  to  reintroduce  a  street-based  townscape.  The  

 


potential  arrival  of  Crossrail  2  will  also  need  to  be  addressed  to  maximise  the  

 


positive   benefits   to   the   area.  

## Area  Character

4.6 Dalston  is  the  largest  centre  in  the  Borough,  and  is  classified  as  one  of  London's  
  

 

 


major  town  centres  as  defined  by  the  London  Plan.  As  a  major  centre  it  provides  

 
 
  
 
a  greater  variety  of  shops  and  services  than  district  or  local  centres  within  


Hackney.  Dalston  is  located  to  the  western  side  of  the  Borough,  serving  both  


Hackney   and   Islington   residents.  

4.7 Historically  a  village,  Dalston  was  


boosted  by  the  arrival  of  the  first  


Dalston  Junction  station  in  the  1860s.  


The  historic  character  and  urban  grain  


of  Dalston  is  still  prevalent  as  it  is  


surrounded  by  Georgian  and  Victorian  


streets,  with  many  older  properties  


housing  shops  and  businesses  on  


Kingsland   High   Street.  


Dalston  Location  Plan  

4.8 The  greatest  intensity  of  the  centre  is  along  the  High  


Road  with  buildings  rising  to  four  and  five  storeys.  The  


Kingsland  Shopping  Centre  and  Ridley  Road  Market  


also  form  an  important  part  of  the  centre.  Though  


important,  the  Kingsland  Shopping  Centre  is  inward  


facing   and   not   of   high   architectural   quality.   

## Urban  Design  Analysis

4.9 Much  of  Dalston  is  within  a  conservation  area  which  reflects  the  area's  unique  

 


history   and   the   need   to   manage   the   area's  heritage   assets.   
  

 
4.10 Dalston's  street  layout  is  of  a  coarser  

 
  
 
grain  generated  by  the  plots  and  


building  footprints  of  industrial  uses 


associated  with  the  railway  and  more  


recent  developments  such  as  the  


Kingsland  Shopping  Centre.  They  


restrict  the  ability  for  more  fine  grain  


pedestrian 
 and 
 cycle 
 movement  


through  the  town  centre.  The  scale  of  


development  is  much  finer  in  areas  


surrounding   the   town   centre.   
  


4.11 More  recent  developments  such  as  


Dalston  Square  though  larger  in  scale,  provide  a  mix  of  housing  and  commercial  

 
 
  


development  together  with  community  facilities  in  the  form  of  a  new  library  and  

 


public   square.   
  
 
 
4.12 There  are  limited  areas  of  public  open  space  within  the  town  centre  and  they  are  


currently  poorly  connected.  There  are  limited  opportunities  for  additional  open  


space  with  the  exception  of  the  Eastern  Curve.  Street  based  activity  remains  


focused  around  the  busy  High  Road  and  Ridley  Road  where  further  public  realm  


improvements   would   be   beneficial.   
  
 
 
4.13 Kingsland  High  Street  (A10)  is  the  main  route  through  this  area  and  is  heavily  

 
 
traffic  dominated.  As  a  result  of  this,  it  suffers  from  high  noise  and  air  pollution  

 

 


levels.  Pedestrian  flows  are  amongst  the  highest  in  the  Borough,  the  wider  


traffic  lanes  along  the  A10  corridor  can  be  a  severance  to  pedestrians  crossing  

 


the   A10. 
  

 


4.14
There  are  a  number  of  creative,  cultural  and  community  uses  centred  around  
 
  


Ashwin  Street  and  parts  of  Dalston  Lane,  collectively  known  as  the  Dalston  


Quarter.  This  area  has  the  potential  to  further  enhance  its  value  as  a  


concentrated   area   of   community,   creative   and   cultural   activities.   
  
 
 
4.15 The  opening  of  Dalston  Junction  station  alongside  Dalston  Kingsland  has  


increased  the  accessibility  of  the  centre.  Accessibility  by  public  transport  may  be  


enhanced  further  as  Crossrail  2  is  currently  planned  to  run  to  a  station  at  


Dalston.  
 

## Policy  Pp2  Dalston Strategic   Principles

Where   appropriate   development   should:   
  

●
Implement  a  variety  of  public  realm  improvements  across  the  town  


centre  particularly  along  Kingsland  High  Street,  Dalston  Lane  and  


Ridley   Road.  
 
●
Improve  permeability  through  finer  grain  development  within  the  town  


centre,  particularly  through  new  proposals  for  Kingsland  Shopping  


Centre.  
 
●
Improve  noise  and  air  quality  by  creating  a  pedestrian  and 


cycle-friendly   environment   across   the   town   centre.  
 
●
Protect  existing  open  spaces  including  the  Dalston  Eastern  Curve  


Garden   and   maximise   opportunities   to   create   new   public   space  
 
●
Reinforce  the  individual  qualities  of  the  distinct  urban  character  areas  


and   heritage   assets   in   Dalston   town   centre.  
 
●
Protect  and  enhance  the  value  of  the  Dalston  Quarter  as  a  


concentrated   area   of   community,   creative   and   cultural   activities.  
 
●
Improve  public  transport  accessibility  through  the  potential  arrival  of  


Crossrail   2.

4.19 The  diagram  below  illustrates  the  nature  of  intervention  on  the  spectrum  of  


reinforce-repair-reinvent  that  is  required  within  Dalston  as  identified  in  the  


boroughwide   Characterisation   Study:  

 

## Pp3   Hackney   Central   And   Surrounds Vision

4.20 Hackney  Central  will  be  a  thriving  major  town  centre:  the  Borough's  civic  and  

 


cultural  hub  and  a  strategically  important  employment  area.  The  area  will  be  a  

 

 
safe  and  attractive  place  to  walk  and  cycle,  well  connected  to  key  destinations  


nearby  and  outside  of  the  Borough,  with  an  improved  station  and  gateways  to  


the  town  centre.  Its  high  quality  public  realm  and  improved  public  spaces,  which  


encourage  people  to  dwell  in  the  town  centre,  will  be  complemented  by  the  


provision  of  new,  high  quality  retail,  leisure,  workspace  and  housing  to  meet  the  


needs   of   residents.  
 

## Area  Character

4.21 Hackney  Central  is  located  to  the  east  of  Dalston  and  is  the  civic  and  cultural  


hub  of  Hackney.  Mare  Street  is  the  main  spine  route  which  runs  through  the  


area.  The  civic  town  square,  framed  by  Hackney  Town  Hall,  the  Hackney  


Empire  theatre,  library,  museum  and  cinema,  provides  a  concentrated  node  of  

 


cultural  and  civic  institutions  that  form  frequent  and  regular  destinations  for  


Hackney's  residents   and   visitors.  


4.22 The 
 area 
 currently 
 offers 
 good  


convenience  retail,  although  outlet  retail  


and  associated  workspace  is  emerging,  


particularly  around  Morning  Lane.  This  


cluster  of  outlet  retail  has  quickly  risen  to  


be  one  of  Hackney's  biggest  attractions,  


drawing  visitors  from  across  the  city,  as  


well   as   foreign   tourists.  


4.23 The  area  benefits  from  excellent  public  transport  connectivity,  with  three  


Overground  stations  within  easy  walking  distance  of  the  Town  Centre,  and  a  

 
number  of  bus  routes  serving  the  wider  city.  Hackney  Central,  Hackney  Downs  


and  London  Fields  Overground  stations  are  currently  all  accessed  via  narrow  


walkways  or  entrances  under  railway  bridges  that  are  not  directly  visible  from  


the  area's  main  centres  of  activity  and  would  benefit  from  improvement.  There  is  

 
potential  for  a  Crossrail  2  station,  as  part  of  an  eastern  branch,  in  the  future  
 
  
  


which  would  further  strengthen  Hackney  Central's  accessibility  and  attract  


development   interest   and   investment.  
 

## Urban  Design  Analysis

4.24 Hackney  Central's  town  centre  is  the  historic  focal  point  of  the  area  and  contains  

 


some  of  the  Borough's  most  attractive  and  significant  buildings  and  open  


spaces.  The  area  has  an  attractive  network  of  streets  and  spaces  although  in  


places  traffic  dominates  and  continuity  of  active  frontage  breaks  down.  Work  to  


pedestrianise  The  Narrow  Way  -  Hackney  Central's  main  retail  street  -  has  

 

 
 
been  completed  and  further  public  realm  improvements  will  follow  as  


development   sites   are   brought   forward.  


4.25 Hackney  Central's  main  artery  roads  are  generally  dominated  by  traffic  and  as  a  

 
result  suffer  from  high  noise  and  air  pollution  primarily  around  the  junctions  of  


Mare  Street,  Graham  Road  and  Morning  Lane  which  are  difficult  junctions  to  


cross   and   navigate   for   people   from  all   walks   of   life.  


4.26 The  area  contains  neighbourhoods  with  traditional  perimeter  block  layouts  to  the  


east  of  Mare  Street  and  north  of  Victoria  Park,  and  more  recent  residential  areas  


of   blocks   in   open   space   to   the   east   of   Mare   Street.  


4.27 Hackney   Central   is   comprised   of   3   significant   character   areas:  


●
Hackney  Central  -  Focused  along  Mare  Street  and  the  Narrow  Way  with  
 
  


busy  streets  and  quiet  routes  leading  off  to  the  east  and  west.  The  area  


contains  a  significant  concentration  of  employment  uses  focused  between  
  


Mare   Street   and   the   railway   line.  
 
●
London  Fields  -  A  neighbourhood  focused  around  London  Fields  open  
 
  


space  with  creative  employment  spaces  to  the  east  of  the  railway  tracks  


and   within   the   arches.  
 
●
Victoria  Park  and  Well  Street  -  Older  residential  neighbourhoods  along  the  

 


northern   edge   of   Victoria   Park   with   an   attractive   historic   character.  
 

## Policy  Pp3  Hackney  Central  And  Surrounds Strategic   Principles

Where   appropriate   development   should:   
  

●
Strengthen  the  role  of  the  town  centre  and  the  expanding  economy  


with 
 increased 
 development 
 capacity 
 for 
 commercial 
 (retail/  


workspace/   leisure/   community)   and   residential   uses   across   the   area.  
 
●
Implement  a  variety  of  public  realm  improvements,  including  


improvements  in  Hackney  Central  town  centre  around  Amhurst  Road  


and  the  Narrow  Way  which  will  increase  footfall,  improve  the  legibility,  


permeability  and  character  of  the  area  and  create  more  space  for  


people   to   dwell   and   spend   time   within   the   town   centre.  
 
●
Improve  the  town  square  public  realm  in  Hackney  Central  at  the  


junction  between  the  Narrow  Way/  Mare  Street/  Amhurst  Road  utilising  


the  historic  Old  Town  Hall  building  with  the  potential  for  an  anchor  use  


to  maximise  its  position  in  this  key  location  and  to  enliven  and  


potentially   enlarge   the   town   square   public   realm.  
 
●
Potentially  relocate  Clapton  Bus  Garage  (without  compromising  


ongoing  bus  operations)  to  an  alternative  location  such  as  Ash  Grove  


and  the  Lea  Bridge  roundabout  (see  Place  Policies  for  Clapton),  


freeing  up  a  key  town  centre  site  for  redevelopment  and  improving  


permeability   throughout   and   arrival   into   the   town   centre.  
 
●
Redevelop  55  Morning  Lane  (Tesco  Site)  for  the  provision  of  new  


commercial   floorspace   and   housing.   
  
●
Utilise  Bohemia  Place  as  a  pedestrian  route  and  open  up  2  or  3  of  the  

 

 
  
 
 
railway  arches  in  accordance  with  the  Hackney  Central  and  Surrounds  


Masterplan   (2017)   to   improve   movement   through   the   town   centre.  
 
●
Improve  important  transport  infrastructure  at  Hackney  Central,  


Hackney  Downs  and  London  Fields  Overground  stations  to  ensure  


stations  adequately  accommodate  increased  passenger  capacity  and  


through  public  realm  improvements  facilitating  connectivity  and  


wayfinding.  
 
●
Relocate  and  rationalise  several  Hackney  Housing  depots,  freeing  up  


key   town   centre   sites   for   mixed   use   redevelopment.  
 

## Key  Land  Use  Designations

4.28 The   following   designations   identified   on   the   Policies   Map   and   the   relevant   
policies   in   the   Plan   are   applicable   in   this   area:   
  
 
 
●
Major   Town   Centre  
 
●
Mare   Street   Priority   Office   Area  
 
●
Helmsley   Place  Locally   Significant   Industrial   Sites  

## Development  Opportunities

●

●
Employment  -  demand  for  new  (B1)  office  alongside  re-provided  industrial  
  


space  
 
●
Retail   -  demand   for  new  floorspace   with  a  focus  on  comparison   goods  
 
●
Community   and  cultural   facilities   to  support  new  and  existing   communities

4.30 The  diagram  below  illustrates  the  nature  of  intensification  that  should  occur  within  


Hackney   Central   as  identified   in  the  Hackney   Characterisation   Study.  
 
  
  

## Pp4   Stamford   Hill Vision

4.31 A  cohesive,  unique,  distinctive  and  better  connected  neighbourhood  for  all  


communities  in  Stamford  Hill  with  enhanced  areas  of  individual  character.  By  


2033  Stamford  Hill  will  have  become  an  even  more  attractive  liveable  urban  


neighbourhood,  providing  new  homes  and  jobs,  connected  through  new  and  


renovated  urban  environments  designed  around  communities'  specific  


residential,  civic  and  economic  needs,  and  connected  by  linking  together  its  


open   spaces   with   improved   streets   and   public   spaces.  

## Area  Character

4.32 This  policy  applies  to  the  whole  of  the  AAP  area  as  shown  on  the  Policies  Map.  


This  area  of  Hackney  is  in  the  northeast  part  of  the  Borough  and  has  the  most  

 


suburban  sense  of  place  of  all  of  the  areas  within  Hackney.  Stamford  Hill  feels  


distinct  in  terms  of  its  relatively  low  density  with  wider  streets  and  larger  


properties   compared   to   the   southern   part   of   the   Borough.   
  
 
 
4.33 Stamford  Hill  is  designated  as  a  district  centre  and  there  are  a  number  of  


smaller  local  shopping  centres  within  residential  neighbourhoods.  Stamford  Hill  


is  on  the  edge  of  the  Borough  and  therefore  also  serves  the  community  in  South  

 
 
Tottenham.  


4.34 This  part  of  the  Borough  has  the  youngest  demography  in  the  Borough  and  as  a  

 

 
result  of  its  growing  population  is  creating  a  demand  for  larger  family  homes.  

 


The  community  in  Stamford  Hill  is  also  distinctive  with  a  large  Jewish  Orthodox  

 

 


community  which  is  reflected  in  the  community  services,  shops  and  housing  in  


the   area.  


4.35 There  are  few  designated  heritage  assets  at  Stamford  Hill  Broadway  and  the  


area  is  less  sensitive  than  other  parts  of  the  Borough,  but  the  higher  ground  


makes   the   taller   buildings   more   prominent.   
  
 
 
4.36 Stamford  Hill  provides  an  opportunity  to  build  upon  its  distinctive  local  character  


and  diverse  neighbourhood.  The  emerging  Stamford  Hill  AAP  will  provide  the  


strategic  parameters  to  promote  new  homes  and  jobs  that  will:  enhance  its  


architectural  and  landscape  merits;  promote  positive  change;  maximise  the  use  


of  undeveloped  sites;  and  address  local  issues  around  overcrowding,  traffic  


congestion,   and   under   provision   of   play   spaces   for   children.   
  
 
 
4.37 The  area  offers  the  potential  for  a  more  pleasant  neighbourhood  centre  at  the  

 


heart   of   a   community   that   can   adapt   positively   to   the   pressures   it  faces.  

## Urban  Design  Analysis

4.38 Stamford  Hill  was  redeveloped  as  the  local  centre  of  an  intensified  


neighbourhood  in  the  early  20th  Century  and  was  influenced  by  the  spacious,  


green  character  of  garden  city  suburbs.  However,  the  junction  of  Stamford  Hill  


Broadway  is  an  expansive  and  traffic-dominated  space  which  lacks  any  


pedestrian  focal  point,  respite  from  the  traffic  or  quality  green  spaces  or  


planting.  


4.39 The  area  feels  distinct  from  the  southern  part  of  the  Borough  in  terms  of  its  


relatively  low  density  with  wider  streets  and  larger  properties.  Urban  terraces  


are  the  predominant  housing  typology  with  some  mansion  block  estates  focused  


on  the  A10  corridor.  There  are  a  number  of  more  industrial  employment  spaces  

 


to   the   east   of   the   area   on   the   edge   of   the   Lea   Valley.  


Stamford  Hill  Urban  Design  Analysis  
 
  

## Policy  Pp4  Stamford  Hill Strategic   Principles

Where   appropriate   development   should:   
  

●
Create  high  quality  urban  design  in  Stamford  Hill  that  enhances  its  


distinctive  local  character,  celebrates  its  diverse  community  and  seeks  


to  enhance  its  architectural  and  landscape  merits  through  a  


fine-grained  approach  that  promotes  positive  change  and  maximises  


the   use   of   underdeveloped   sites.  
 
●
Provide  new  and  extended  homes  with  a  range  of  dwelling  types,  sizes  

 


and  tenures  to  sustain  mixed  and  balanced  communities,  with  a  


particular   focus   on   housing   for   large   families   and   single   people.  
 
●
Maximise  the  benefits  of  Crossrail  2  and  other  improvements  to  public  

 


transport   to   support   growth   and   existing   communities.   
  
●
Address  deficiencies  in  children's  play  provision  in  the  northern  and  


southern   parts   of   the   area.  
 
●
Contribute  to  improving  the  network  of  streets  and  footpaths  to  make  


walking  and  cycling  safe  and  pleasant  and  reduce  traffic  congestion  in  

 
the  Stamford  Hill  area,  particularly  around  Oldhill  Street  and  Dunsmure  


Road.  
 
●
Create  new  jobs,  employment  workspace  and  affordable  workspace,  


diversify  the  economy  in  the  Stamford  Hill  area  and  increase  


employment   rates.  
 
●
Improve  connections  between  existing  open  spaces  within  the  


Stamford  Hill  area  with  a  particular  focus  on  east  west  links  to  improve  

 


accessibility  between  Woodberry  Downs  and  the  Lea  Valley  Regional  


Park.  
 
●
Improve  the  retail  function  of  Stamford  Hill  Broadway,  Stoke  Newington  


(north),  Dunsmure  Road  and  Old  Hill  Street  as  vibrant  and  mixed  use  


shopping  centres  that  are  attractive  and  accessible  to  all,  and  meet  the  


needs   of   the   local   Community.  
 
●
Create  an  accessible,  distinctive  and  vibrant  town  centre  at  Stamford  


Hill  Broadway  that  builds  on  its  distinct  architectural  quality  and  is  a  

 
cultural  destination  for  visitors,  to  promote  flexible  mixed-use  


development  in  the  Stamford  Hill  town  centre  and  increase  the  range  


of   shops,   restaurants,   cafes   and   employment   opportunities.  
 
●
Facilitate  interaction  between  people  of  different  social,  ethnic  and  


religious   affiliation.  
 
●
Provide  additional  school  places  for  the  Stamford  Hill  community  and  


to  provide  new  opportunities  for  adult  learning  and  to  ensure  that  


people  who  live  and  work  in  Stamford  Hill  have  access  to  local  


educational,  training,  health  and  community  facilities  to  meet  their  


day-to-day   needs.  
 
●
Promote  the  health  and  well-being  of  local  people  by  supporting  active  


lifestyles   and   reducing   health   inequalities.  
 
●
Support  the  development  of  cultural  and  religious  facilities,  arts,  and  


leisure   and   entertainment   opportunities   for   all.

## Development  Opportunities

4.40 The   Stamford   Hill   AAP   will   identify   key   development   opportunities.   It   will   include   
site   allocations   to   provide   site   specific   guidance,   allocate   uses   and   provide development   capacities.  


4.41 The  diagram  below  illustrates  the  nature  of  intervention  that  should  occur  within  


Stamford   Hill   as   identified   in   the   Characterisation   Study.  

 

## Pp5   Enhanced   Corridors Vision

4.42 Hackney's  major  corridors  will  be  enhanced  to  reinforce  the  unique  historic  area  


character  through  new  mixed-use  housing-led  developments  on  infill  sites  and  


above  existing  buildings,  new  community  facilities  and  other  measures  to  


promote  healthy  streets  and  public  realm  improvements  focusing  on  urban  


greening  to  combat  air  pollution  along  these  routes.  There  will  be  improved  


legibility  of  stations  along  these  corridors,  enhancing  connectivity  with  town  


centres  whilst  strengthening  existing  routes  as  well  as  improved  east-west  


connectivity   along   the   Lea   Valley   edge.  
 

## Area  Character

4.43 A  number  of  significant  spine  roads  run  through  the  Borough  that  have  a  


distinctive  character  from  other  roads  in  Hackney.  These  roads  are  the  key  


arteries  that  link  together  Hackney's  main  centres  of  investment,  commerce,  


culture  and  leisure.  The  parts  of  these  routes  that  sit  outside  of  the  mixed  urban  


centres  have  been  designated  as  'corridors'  with  potential  for  enhancement  and  


change.  


4.44 These  major  routes  are  primarily  north-south  in  nature  and  include  the  former  


Roman  road  of  Ermine  Street,  now  known  as  the  A10  stretching  from  


Shoreditch  High  Street  in  the  south  of  the  Borough  through  to  Dalston  High  


Street  and  Stamford  Hill  in  the  north  of  the  Borough.  Another  is  the  Mare  Street,  

 


Clapton   Common   to   Seven   Sisters   spine.  


4.45 There  are  also  significant  east-west  routes  running  through  the  Borough  such  as  


Old  Street  to  Hackney  Road;  and  Dalston  Lane,  Morning  Lane  to  Wick  Road.  


These  arteries  have  a  great  variety  of  development  along  their  lengths  and  


strong   identities   based   on   the   chain   of   differing   places   along   them.  


4.46 The  River  Lee  corridor  forms  part  of  the  wider  Lee  Valley  Regional  Park  and  


differs  in  that  it  is  an  important  artery  for  walking,  cycling,  wildlife,  river  


communities  and  for  leisure  and  recreation.  It  forms  a  strong,  green  boundary  

 
  


along  Hackney's  eastern  edge  and  has  a  cohesive  identity  that  policies  in  this  

 


Plan  seek  to  protect  or  enhance.  At  Hackney  Wick  and  Lea  Bridge  it  is  a  focus  

   
 
for  investment  and  change,  but  it  also  balances  the  urban  intensity  of  the  


Borough  with  open  space  and  leisure.  It  is  partly  this  contrast  that  makes  


Hackney   such   an   attractive   place   to   live   and   invest   in.  

## Urban  Design  Analysis

4.47 The  main  arterial  roads  are  busy  and  often  highly  trafficked  places.  There  is  


high  transport  accessibility,  from  the  bus  routes  that  run  along  them  to  the  


stations  they  connect,  which  makes  them  attractive  commercial  locations  and  


focal   points   for   change   and   investment,   but   less   popular   as   residential   locations.  


4.48 These  routes  are  some  of  the  oldest  in  Hackney  and  as  such  they  have  seen  


the  greatest  level  of  change  and  redevelopment.  They  are  also  lined  with  the  


Borough's  most  significant  and  historic  buildings  and  spaces  which  could  be  


repaired   and   enhanced.   
  
 
 
4.49 The  frontage  along  these  routes  varies  in  terms  of  land  use  and  quality.  In  some  

 


places  there  is  a  continual  linear  high  street  environment,  characterised  by  small  
 
   


shops  and  businesses  that  provide  activity  to  the  street.  In  other  areas  the  retail  


frontage  falls  away  to  larger  sites  that  present  an  opportunity  for  redevelopment,  


such  as  car  sales  garages,  large  format  supermarkets  or  builders  merchants.  In  


other  locations  housing  estates  form  the  frontage  to  the  streets,  often  heavily  set  


back   behind   wide   grass   verges.   
  
 
 
4.50 There  is  the  opportunity  to  think  in  greater  detail  about  the  continuity  of  these  


routes,  including  landscaping  opportunities  and  the  potential  for  intensification,  


given   the   high   levels   of   accessibility   and   mix   in   scale.  
 
  

## Policy  Pp5  Enhanced  Corridors Strategic   Principles

Where   appropriate   development   should:   
  

## Urban   Corridors

●
Improve   the   distinction   between   town   centres   and   surrounding   areas.  
 
●
Create  and  enhance  local  character  and  distinctiveness,  provide  new  


homes  and  commercial  opportunities,  and  provide  community  


infrastructure.  
●
Improve  air  quality  along  these  routes  by  minimising  car  use,  enabling  


walking   and   cycling   and   reducing   pollution   through   tree   planting.  
 
●
Improve  the  corridors  as  places  which  make  walking  and  cycling  safer,  


healthier  and  more  enjoyable  options  by  reducing  pollution  and  


improving   corridors   as   places   to   spend   time.  
 
●
Improve  the  character  and  attractiveness  of  corridors  and  consider  


them   gateways   to   Hackney.  
 

## Lee   Valley   Corridor

●
Improve  access  to  and  across  the  Lee  Valley  Regional  Park,  and  


improve   connections   to   Waltham   Forest.  
 
●
Create   and   enhance   the   special   character   of   the   area.  
 
●
Create  a  higher  quality  edge  to  the  Lee  Valley  by  improving  the  routes  
  


which   run   along   it,   and   improving   the   relationship   of   buildings   to   it.  
 
●
Improve  the  Lea  Bridge  roundabout  at  Clapton  as  a  priority  residential,  

 
 
 
public  realm  and  commercial  opportunity  area,  and  gateway  to  


Hackney.  
 

## Pp6   Hackney   Wick Vision

4.51 Hackney  Wick  will  become  a  more  vibrant,  diverse  and  well  connected  series  of  

 


neighbourhoods  with  places  of  social,  cultural  and  economic  activity,  with  its  


unique  creative  character  and  heritage  retained.  The  established  residential  


areas  in  the  north,  historic  character  in  the  centre,  and  industrial  areas  to  the  


south,  will  have  been  complemented  by  a  mix  of  new  homes,  employment 


floorspace,  including  affordable  and  low  cost  workspace,  and  community  


facilities  around  and  within  buildings  of  historic  interest,  a  new  Neighbourhood  

 
 
 
Centre  and  an  upgraded  railway  station.  These  will  be  served  by  and  have  


direct  access  to  the  open  spaces  and  world-class  sporting  facilities  of  Queen  


Elizabeth  Olympic  Park.  A  new  digital  quarter  of  hi-tech,  media,  broadcasting  


and  education  activities  will  be  clustered  within  and  around  Here  East,  and  


complemented  by  a  significant  presence  of  creative  and  cultural  industries  


producing   bespoke   and   artistic   products   west   of   the   Lee   Navigation.  

## Area  Character

4.52 Located  on  the  eastern  boundary  


of  the  Borough  and  under  the  


planning  authority  of  the  London  


Legacy  Development  Corporation  


(LLDC) ,  Hackney  Wick  has  been  


shaped  by  the  course  of  a  number  

 
 
of  waterways  -  first  the  Hackney  


Brook 
 and 
 River 
 Lea, 
 then  


Hackney 
 Cut 
 canal, 
 which  


connected  the  Lea  to  the  Regents  


Canal  and  Thames  docklands.  


Railway  developments  and  road  


layouts  led  to  further  isolation  of  


the   area.  


4.53 Historically  predominated  by  industrial  uses,  with  a  residential  community  in  the  

 
 
  
 
northern  part  of  Hackney  Wick  around  and  in  the  Eastway  and  Trowbridge  


Estate,  much  of  the  area  is  undergoing  a  significant  change  with  the  delivery  of  

 
  


the  post  2012  Games  Legacy  Development  at  East  Wick  and  Sweetwater  


underway  that  will  become  entirely  new  communities  with  homes  and  new 


schools,   community   space,   business   and   retail   space   being   built.  


4.54 Home  to  one  of  the  greatest  densities  of  artists  in  Europe,  the  reinvention  of  the  

 


Olympic  press  and  broadcast  facilities  at  Here  East  has  created  a  technology  

 
 
and  media-focused  hub  which,  together  with  the  rest  of  Hackney  Wick,  provides  


space  for  creative  and  productive  businesses,  complementing  the  established  


clusters   of   artists   and   creatives   in   the   area.  


4.55 A  new  local  centre  largely  covered  by  an  existing  conservation  area  designation  


has  been  identified.  Hackney  Wick  Local  Centre  will  provide  a  mix  of  


employment,  retail  and  community  uses  along  with  new  residential  forming  a  

 
focus  around  the  rebuilt  Hackney  Wick  Station  which  has  the  potential  to  


provide   a   focus   for   wider   regeneration   including   East   Wick   and   Sweetwater.  


4.56 The  existence  of  the  improved  waterways,  pathways  and  parks  provide  a  vibrant  

 
 
boating  and  cycle  community  in  Hackney  Wick  due  to  its  excellent  connectivity  


with   existing   transport   networks.  
 

## Urban  Design  Analysis

4.57 Hackney  Wick's  historically  well-connected  grid  of  residential  terraced  streets  


was  comprehensively  redeveloped  in  the  1970s.   The  replacement  high-rise  


housing  and  low  rise  blocks  were  unsuccessful  and  replaced  in  the  1990s.   


However,  the  street  layout  remains  confusing  and  indirect.   The  arrival  route  into  


Hackney  Wick  from  the  west,  which  once  continued  directly  into  the  commercial  


core,  now  runs  indirectly  alongside  the  sunken  trunk  road  and  suffers  from  


inactive   frontages   and   a   highway-dominated,   hostile   character.    
  
 
 
4.58 The  historic  commercial  core  of  Hackney  Wick  has  an  attractive  industrial  


character. Recent  public  realm  works  have  improved  the  central  streets,  and  


connections  to  Stratford  via  Queen  Elizabeth  Olympic  Park  have  radically  


improved  the  relationship  of  the  area  with  its  surroundings. The  Hackney  Wick  


masterplan  is  guiding  development  to  maintain  characterful  and  historic  


buildings  within  a  recently  designated  conservation  area.   It  is  also  opening  up  a  
 
  

  

 

grid  of  new,  direct  streets  and  connecting  the  centre  to  Fish  Island  and  the  canal  


to  the  south.  The  recently  completed  station  and  route  to  the  north  will  form  a  

 
new   high   street   serving   local   people.  
 
 
4.59 Hackney  Wick  is  surrounded  to  the  east  and  south  by  water,  and  to  the  west  


and  north  by  a  ring  of  road,  rail  and  occasionally  designated  woodland  and  


green  spaces.   Its  island  character  is  one  of  its  great  strengths  although  


improving  connections  to  the  west  will  allow  better  access  for  residents  from  


outside  to  the  developing  local  town  centre.  Outside  of  the  masterplan  area,  


improvements  to  the  built  and  open  fabric  of  the  residential  areas  will  make  the  


area  a  better  place  for  families  to  live.  Mixed-use  and  employment  sites  around  
  


Hackney  Wick  should  be  reinforced  to  support  the  thriving  and  creative  


economy   of   the   area.      
 

## Policy  Pp6  Hackney  Wick

 Strategic    Principles  
 
Where   appropriate   development   should:   
  

●
Improve  the  unique  mix  of  warehouse  units  that  are  key  to  the  thriving  


creative   economy   of   Hackney   Wick.  
 
●
Preserve  and  deliver  new  affordable  workspace  and  affordable  housing  


in   perpetuity.  
 
●
Improve   connections   east   to   the   rest   of   Hackney.  
 
●
Improve   the   access   roads   into   Hackney   Wick   from  the   west.  
 
●
Maintain   the   heritage   and   character   of   buildings.  
 
●
Maintain  the  functionally  important  buildings  which  provide  low-cost  


workspace   and   resist   their   conversion   to   other   uses.  
 
●
Improve  connections  to  Stratford  and  the  Queen  Elizabeth  Olympic  


Park.  
 
●
Create  a  new  'high  street'  of  commercial  uses  to  support  Hackney  


Wick's  residential   and   working   population.  
 
●
Improve   connections   south   to   the   Canal   and   Fish   Island.  
 

## Key  Land  Use  Designations

4.60 The   following   designations   identified   on   the   Policies   Map   and   the   relevant   
policies   in   the   Plan   are   applicable   in   this   area:   
  
 
 
●
Hackney   Wick   Neighbourhood   Centre  
 
●
Strategic   Industrial   Land   (SIL)-   Hackney   Wick   SIL,   Palace   Road  
 
●
Locally  Significant  Industrial  Sites  -  Bartrip  Street  LSIS,  Eastway  Buxhall  

 


Crescent   LSIS,   Eastway   Osborn   Road   LSIS,   Lee   Conservancy   LSIS  
 

## Development  Opportunities

4.61 The  quantum  of  development  identified  for  Hackney  Wick  (including  parts  of  


Tower   Hamlets)   until   2033   is   outlined   below:  


●
Residential   -   1,550  
 
●
Employment   -   10,065  
 
●
Retail   -   7,301  
 
●
Community   -   6,888  


4.62 The  LLDC's  Local  Plan  includes  three  site  allocations  in  Hackney  Wick  that  the  


Council  considers  will  provide  key  development  opportunities  suitable  for  


development   during   the   lifetime   of   this   Plan:  


●
Bartrip   Street   South  
 
●
Hackney   Wick   Station   Area  
 
●
East   Wick   and   Here   East  
 

## 4.63 The  Diagram  Below  Illustrates  The  Nature  Of  Intervention  That  Should  Occur  Within Hackney   Wick   As   Identified   In   The   Boroughwide   Characterisation   Study: Statement:

 Following  the  2012  London  Olympic  and  Paralympic  Games,  the  London  


Legacy  Development  Corporation  (LLDC)  was  established  by  the  Mayor  


of  London  as  a  mayoral  development  corporation.  It  is  the  Local  Planning  

 

  


Authority  for  a  part  of  the  London  Borough  of  Hackney  (as  well  as  the  
 
  


other  Olympic  host  boroughs).  The  area  covered  by  the  LLDC  is  shown  

 
 
on  the  Policies  Map.  It  includes  Hackney  Wick  and  the  north-eastern  part  

 


of   the   Queen   Elizabeth   Olympic   Park   detailed   in   PP6. The  planning  powers  will  transfer  back  from  LLDC  to  Hackney  during  the  


lifetime  of  this  Plan.  This  Place  Policy  is  consistent  with  the  LLDC's  Local  

 


Plan   and   associated   Hackney   Wick   and   Fish   Island   SPD. The  LLDC  Local  Plan  remains  the  development  plan  for  Hackney  Wick,  


for  the  purposes  of  decision  making  under  S38(6)  of  the  Planning  and  


Compulsory  PurchaseAct  2004  (as  amended)  until  powers  are  


transferred   back   to   Hackney.  

## Pp7   Clapton   And   Lea   Bridge   Roundabout Vision

4.64 Clapton  will  become  a  better  connected  neighbourhood  which  makes  the  best  

 


use  of  its  gateway  location  to  the  Borough  and  proximity  to  the  open  space  and  


waterways  of  Hackney  Downs  and  the  Lee  Valley  Regional  Park.  It  will  have  a  

 
 
  
civic  heart  and  identity  of  its  own  centred  around  a  reinvented  public  realm  for  

 


the  Lea  Bridge  Roundabout  and  linear  enhancements  linking  upper  and  lower  


Clapton  town  centres.  It  will  better  serve  the  needs  of  the  community  through  

 


new  development  opportunities  and  through  measures  that  significantly  improve  


air   quality.  
 

## Area  Character

4.65 The  Lea  Bridge  roundabout  is  one  of  the  Council's  biggest  challenges.  The  


roundabout  is  a  barrier  to  negotiating  the  area  comfortably  on  foot  and  the  


concentration  of  buses  and  delivery  vehicles  results  in  a  noisy  environment  with  

  


poor  air  quality.  The  roundabout  has  the  greatest  potential  to  become  a  new  

 
 
destination  place  accommodating  homes,  retail,  employment  space  and  public  


realm   around   a   new   reconfigured   junction.  


4.66 It  may  be  necessary  to  accept  reduced  capacity  of  the  junction  by  removing  the  


roundabout.  Creating  a  cross  junction  instead  would  offer  a  unique  opportunity  
 
  

 
 
 
to  restore  the  historic  form  of  Upper  and  Lower  Clapton  Road  and  thereby  


redefine   the   nature   of   Clapton   as   a   cohesive   centre.  


4.67 There  is  potential  to  renew  and  repair  


some  of  the  residential  estates  in  the  


area  as  well  as  a  focus  on  mixed-use  

 


development  around  Clapton  station  


and  the  connection  between  the  


various  parts  of  Upper  and  Lower  


Clapton  Road  including  the  possibility 


of 
 remodelling 
 the 
 Lea 
 Bridge  


roundabout.  Clapton  is  adjacent  to  the  
 
  


natural  and  open  spaces  of  Millfields,  


Lea  River  and  Lee  Valley  Regional  


Park,  and  close  enough  to  benefit  


from  the  regeneration  at  Lea  Valley  


Eastside  in  neighbouring  Waltham  


Forest.  
 

## Urban  Design  Analysis

4.68 Clapton  is  a  historic  but  fragmented  community  and  commercial  centre  running  
   


along  Upper  and  Lower  Clapton  Roads  and  consisting  of  Lower  Clapton,  


Clapton  Pond  and  Upper  Clapton.  The  expansive  Lea  Bridge  Roundabout  was  


built  across  what  was  once  the  historic  core  of  Clapton.  At  this  point,  two  lane  


streets  increase  to  4  or  5  lanes  creating  a  point  of  intense  and  concentrated  

 
  
 
  


traffic.  Buses  also  terminate  and  wait  at  the  centre  of  the  roundabout.  The  


roundabout  creates  a  physical  and  psychological  severance  between  Upper  


Clapton  and  the  rest  of  central  Hackney  to  the  south,  and  a  similar  barrier  

 
 
 
between   communities   to   the   west   and   the   open   spaces   of   the   Lee   Valley.   
  
 
 
4.69 The  roundabout  is  a  remnant  of  a  period  of  history  where  accommodating  cars  
 
   
 
  


dominated  planning  in  London.  Now  that  planning  is  focused  on  sustainable  


urban  development,  it  offers  the  potential  for  significant  urban  repair,  housing  
 
  


provision,  employment  space  and  environmental  improvement.  As  a  traditional  

 
 
urban  cross  road,  the  sense  of  division  between  north  and  south  and  east  and  


west  could  be  eliminated.  As  a  new  piece  of  city  between  Clapton  Pond  and  

 


Upper  Clapton  it  could  help  create  a  destination  place  with  the  associated  


benefits   it  would   bring.  


4.70 Key  to  improving  this  part  of  Hackney  is  to  look  at  more  efficient  and  innovative  

 


ways  of  accommodating  the  buses  (both  existing  bus  layovers  and  potential  


relocation  of  spaces  and  operations  from  Clapton  Bus  Garage),  maximising  


space  savings  from  new  technology  and  addressing  severance,  improving  the  


public  realm  and  creating  healthy  streets,  new  homes  and  workspace  whilst  also  


improving   bus   journey   times.   
   

## Policy  Pp7  Clapton  And  Lea  Bridge  Roundabout Strategic   Principles

Where   appropriate   development   should:   
  

 
 
●
Relocate  bus  stand  and  re-provide  an  enhanced  stand  /  depot  

 
 
potentially  taking  capacity  from  Clapton  bus  depot  (see  Place  Policy  for  


Hackney   Central).  
 
●
Eliminate  the  severance  between  Upper  and  Lower  Clapton  and  


between   the   Lee   Valley   Park   and   Hackney  
 
●
Improve  air  quality  within  this  Air  Quality  Focus  Area  and  create  a  child  

 
 
friendly   environment.  
 
●
Create  a  residential  and  commercial  community  focal  point  at  Lea  


Bridge   roundabout.  
 
●
Create  a  cohesive  improved  public  realm  experience  between  Upper  
  


and   Lower   Clapton.   
  
●
Create  new  green  links  connecting  open  spaces  to  Clapton  station  and  


a   new   civic   heart.  
 
●
Support   Clapton   Tram   Depot   as   an   employment   and   destination   place.   
  

## Key  Land  Use  Designations

4.71 The  following  designations  identified  on  the  Policies  Map  and  the  relevant  


policies   in   the   Plan   are   applicable   in   this   area:   
  
 
 
●
Local   Centres   -   Upper   Clapton   Road,   Lower   Clapton   Road  
 
●
Priority   Industrial   Areas   (PIAs)    -   Prout   Street   and   Theydon   Road  
 
●
Millfields   Locally   Significant   Industrial   Area   
  

## Development  Opportunities

4.72 The  Council  has  identified  and  allocated  the  following  key  development  


opportunity   site   suitable   for   development   during   the   lifetime   of   this   plan:  


●
Tram   Depot,   38-40   Upper   Clapton   Road,   E5   8BQ   (Site   Allocation   CL1)  


4.73 Further   development   opportunities   and   development   capacities   will   be   
established   through   a   masterplan   for   the   area.  


4.74 The  diagram  below  illustrates  the  nature  of  intensification  that  should  occur  


within   this   area   as   identified   in   the   Characterisation   Study.  

 

## Pp8   Shoreditch   And   Hoxton Vision

4.75 Shoreditch  will  be  a  thriving  and  vibrant  destination  recognised  internationally  

 


for  Tech  City;  the  home  of  creative,  digital  and  tech  industries.  As  the  creative  


heart  of  London,  this  will  include  flexible  office  space  for  start-ups  as  well  as  


space  for  artists,  craftspeople  and  cultural  producers.  It  will  continue  to  be  world  

 


renowned  for  heritage  for  culture,  theatrics,  entertainment  and  leisure,  with  the  


evening  and  night-time  economy  offering  a  diversity  of  uses.  The  benefits  


harnessed  from  the  growth  in  south  Shoreditch  will  extend  into  the  more  


residential  neighbourhoods  of  Hoxton  and  Haggerston  which  will  share  in  the  


success  of  this  part  of  the  Borough  through  improved  access  to  high  quality  


affordable  homes  and  workspaces,  community  facilities,  training  and  


employment.  Physical  improvements  will  also  be  prioritised  through  the  creation  


of  improved  linkages  between  the  neighbourhoods,  public  realm  enhancements,  


urban   greening   and   measures   to   improve   air   quality.  

## Area  Character

4.76 Shoreditch  is  within  the  City  Fringe  Opportunity  Area  and  part  is  within  the  


Central  Activities  Zone  (CAZ).  The  CAZ  is  London's  globally  iconic  core,  


spanning   10   boroughs   and   accommodating   a   third   of   London's  jobs.  


4.77 Shoreditch  and  its  environs  benefit  


from 
 close  proximity  to  the 
 City's  


financial  district,  and  is  the  creative  


heart  of  London  being  at  the  centre  of  


the  UK's  cultural  and  digital  economy.  


The  creative  industries  and  arts  have  


been  attracted  by  the  historic  character  


and  affordability  of  the  area,  and  its  


proximity  to  central  London.  There  is  


also  a  thriving  night  time  economy  in  


and  around  the  South  Shoreditch  


Triangle,  which  is  identified  in  the  


London  Plan  as  a  part  of  the  capital  


that  is  of  international  importance  for  


night 
 time 
 activity. 
 There 
 are  


opportunities  for  offices,  retail  and  


residential  development 
 along  with  


supporting   community   infrastructure.   
  
4.78 The  emerging  Future  Shoreditch  AAP,  which  primarily  covers  the  more  


commercial  area  of  Shoreditch  broadly  aligning  the  boundary  of  London's  CAZ,  


will  seek  to  protect  and  foster  the  continued  economic  success  of  the  area  


alongside  ongoing  protection  of  the  special  historic  character  and  qualities  that  


makes   it  an   inclusive,   exciting,   innovative   and   creative   place.  
 
  
  
4.79 There  is  development  pressure  from  a  number  of  uses,  particularly  commercial,  
  

 


and  the  area  needs  to  deliver  appropriate  capacity  and  growth  in  a  sustainable  

 
 
and   planned   manner.   
  

## Urban  Design  Analysis

4.80 To  the  south  of  the  Regent's  Canal  are  the  residential  neighbourhoods  of  


Hoxton  and  Haggerston,  and  Shoreditch,  the  commercial  heart  of  the  Borough.  


This  area  is  distinctly  different  from  areas  to  the  north  of  the  Canal  being  older,  
 
  


more  dense,  tighter  in  grain  and  more  closely  related  to  the  City.  The  major  


artery  routes  that  run  through  the  area  are  dominated  by  vehicle  traffic  and  as  a  

 
result  suffer  from  high  air  and  noise  pollution  and  are  in  some  places  difficult  to  


cross  and  navigate.  The  area  is  a  focal  point  for  investment  and  also  has  great  

  


potential  for  further  improvement.  If  the  relationship  between  these  places  can  

 


be  improved  then  there  will  be  more  opportunity  for  their  complementary  


strengths   to   be   shared.  
 

## South  Shoreditch  (Old  Street,  Shoreditch  And  The  Edge  Of Angel)

4.81 Shoreditch  is  an  area  of  distinctive  and  unique  character  and  a  clear  boundary. 
  

 
 
 
Its  complex,  dynamic  and  historic  urban  character  is  key  to  its  success  as  a  

 
place.  This  success  attracts  substantial  investment  and  development  pressure.  


One  challenge  that  it  will  continue  to  face  is  accommodating  significant  


residential  and  commercial  development  while  repairing  and  reinforcing  this  


character.  
 

## Hoxton  And  Haggerston

4.82 Hoxton  and  Haggerston  are  very  different  to  Shoreditch  in  character  and  use.  


They  are  primarily  residential  places  supported  by  commercial  uses  and  social  


infrastructure.  One  significant  challenge  here  is  accommodating  new  residential  

 


development  while  repairing  and  enhancing  the  post-war  housing  stock  and  its  


confusing   layouts.  
 

## Shoreditch  And  Hoxton  In  Context

4.83 Hoxton  and  Haggerston  are  Shoreditch's  main  residential  neighbourhoods.  


There  are  opportunities  to  enhance  the  physical  and  social  relationship  between  


Hoxton  and  the  rest  of  Shoreditch,  so  that  Hoxton's  residents  can  better  enjoy  


the   opportunities   brought   about   by   high   levels   of   investment   to   the   south.  


4.84 These  improvements  could  include  physically  improving  routes  (Ermine  Street  


[A10],  Hoxton  Street  and  Pitfield  Street)  between  these  neighbourhoods  by  


repairing  areas  of  broken  character  and  enhancing  the  sense  of  continuity.  It  


could  also  include  requirements  for  developments  in  Shoreditch  to  consider  how  

 

their  public  realm  enhancements  or  cultural  contributions  could  be  more  relevant  


and   welcoming   to   residential   populations   around   Hoxton.  
 

 
 
4.85 PP8  -  Shoreditch  and  Hoxton  covers  the  geographical  areas  of  all  three  wards  
  


of   Hoxton   East   and   Shoreditch,   Hoxton   West   and   Haggerston.  

 
Strategic  Principles  
 
Where  appropriate   development   should:   
  
●
Intensify  the  use  of  land  to  optimise  the  capacity  of  Shoreditch  to  


accommodate  homes,  workplaces,  cultural  and  creative  uses  without  


compromising   its  special   character.  
 
●
Within  Shoreditch,  ensure  that  land  uses  are  mixed  to  ensure  a  vibrant  

 
 
and  dynamic   economy.  
 
●
Improve  connections  between  the  neighbourhoods  of  Shoreditch,  


Hoxton  and  Haggerston  through  improved  wayfinding  and  pedestrian  


and  cycle  connections.  
 
●
Improve  the  integration  of  residential  areas  in  Hoxton  and  Haggerston  


with  the  CAZ  and  wider  City  Fringe  by  encouraging  a  mix  of  uses  that  

 


will  help  soften  the  transition  between  residential  and  employment  


areas.  
 
●
Create  connections  to  existing  green  spaces  and  identify  opportunities  


for  the  delivery  of  new  high  quality  green  space  through  new  


developments.  
 

## Key  Land  Use  Designations

4.5 The  following   designations   identified   on  the  Policies   Map  and  the  relevant   policies   
in  the  Plan  are  applicable   in  this  area:   
  
  
●
Central   Activity  Zone  -  including   specialist   retail  clusters  
 
●
Priority  Office  Areas  -  Wenlock,  Shoreditch  
 
●
Hoxton  Street  Local   Centre  and  street  market  


Development  Opportunities  
 
4.6 The  Shoreditch  AAP  will  identify  key  development  opportunities.  It  will  include  site  

 


allocations  to  provide  site  specific  guidance,  allocate  uses  and  provide  


development   capacities.   
  
  
4.7 The  diagram  below  illustrates  the  nature  of  intensification  that  should  occur  within  


Shoreditch   and  Hoxton  as  identified   in  the  boroughwide   Characterisation   Study:  
 

## Pp9   Manor  House Vision

4.89 Manor  House  will  become  a  dynamic  local  centre  with  healthy  streets  and  a  high  

 

 
 
quality  public  realm  focused  along  Seven  Sisters  Road  and  the  central  cross  


roads.  It  will  become  a  distinctive  gateway  to  Hackney  and  provide  a  new  urban  

 

 
 
 
centre  for  the  Woodberry  Down  regeneration  area,  and  an  attractive  and  


accessible  focus  for  local  shopping,  leisure,  community  services,  and  


employment   for   the   surrounding   communities.  

## Area  Character

4.90 Manor  House  is  the  north-west  gateway  into  the  Borough,  situated  at  the  


junction  of  Green  Lanes  and  Sevens  Sisters  Road.  Manor  House  is  a  local  

 
 
centre  which  could  be  an  attractive  and  accessible  focus  for  local  shopping,  


leisure,   community   services   and   employment   for   the   surrounding   community.  


4.91 There  is  a  concentration  of  hotels  and  


B&Bs  on  the  Seven  Sisters  Road,  and  


the  centre  is  located  next  to  a  major  


regeneration 
 scheme 
 in 
 Woodberry  


Down.  Finsbury  Park  is  a  major  open  


space  on  the  doorstep  of  the  area,  and  


the enhanced Woodberry Wetlands  


makes  the  already  important  nature  


habitat  for  migrating  birds  in  particular  


more publicly accessible, without  


compromising  its  ecological  importance,  


nor  adversely  affecting  the  waterborne  


leisure  activities  in  the  adjacent  West  


Reservoir.  

4.92 Woodberry  Down,  situated  on  both  sides  of  Seven  Sisters  Road,  is  home  to  one  

 


of  Europe's  biggest  housing  regeneration  schemes.  Whilst  the  post-war  estate  


of  Woodberry  Down  experiences  significant  levels  of  deprivation,  it  has  many  

 
 
 
positive  assets  including  access  to  the  East  and  West  Reservoirs,  Manor  House  


Underground  Station,  Clissold  Park  and  Finsbury  Park.  The  planned  major  


renewal  of  this  estate  will  make  the  most  of  these  assets  and  result  in  an  


additional  2,000  homes,  a  new  Academy,  expanded  primary  school,  health  


centre,   youth   club   and   a   first   class   community   centre.  
 

## Urban  Design  Analysis

4.93 The  Manor  House  place  plan  covers  the  core  of  the  Manor  House  AAP  area  and  


the  remaining  opportunity  areas  clustered  around  Manor  House  station.  The  


area  is  focused  on  the  Borough  of  Hackney's  only  Underground  Station  and  is  

 
on  an  important  junction  between  Haringey  Green  Lanes,  Finsbury  Park,  the  


Woodberry  Down  regeneration  area  and  Stoke  Newington. 
 The  area  is  


dominated  by  the  busy  junction  of  Seven  Sisters  Road  and  Green  Lanes  and  is  

 
landmarked  by  an  entrance  to  Finsbury  Park  and  the  'Manor  House',  a  


non-listed  but  distinctive  landmark  building.  Around  this  focal  point  are  several  


shops,  cafes  and  takeaways.  Wide  streets  with  mansion  blocks  set  back  from  


the  street  run  east  and  south,  and  the  road  which  gives  Woodberry  Down  its  


name  runs  away  from  the  busy  streets  towards  the  core  of  the  newly  developed  


Woodberry  Down  centre  and  wetlands  entrance.  Several  sites  around  the  


station  in  multiple  ownership  have  potential  for  significant  redevelopment.  The  


junction   and   public   realm   also   have   potential   for   improvement.  

## Policy  Pp9  Manor  House Strategic   Principles

Where   appropriate   development   should:   
  
 
 
●
Enhance  and  intensify  the  function  of  Manor  House  as  a  vibrant  and  

 
 
 
mixed-use  Local  Centre  that  is  attractive  and  accessible  to  all,  and  


meets   the   needs   of   the   local   community   including   Woodberry   Down.  
 
●
Improve  the  role  of  Manor  House  as  a  gateway  both  to  the  Woodberry  

 


Down  regeneration  area  and  other  neighbourhoods  and  as  a  key  


access   point   to   Finsbury   Park.  
 
●
Provide  new  housing,  employment  and  commercial  development  to  


meet   local   needs   and   aspirations.  
 
●
Improve  movement  to  and  through  the  area  for  all  modes  of  transport,  


to  promote  sustainable  and  healthy  transport  choices  and  achieve  


better   community   integration.  
 
●
Create  local  character  and  distinctiveness  through  development  


appropriate   to   the   area   that   will   deliver   place   shaping.  
 
●
Improve  the  park  edge  and  entrance  which  are  within  Haringey  


Borough   but   are   more   closely   associated   with   Manor   House.  

## Key  Land  Use  Designations

## Development  Opportunities

4.95 The  Council  has  identified  and  allocated  a  number  of  key  development  sites  

 


suitable   for   development   during   the   lifetime   of   this   plan:  


●
Woodberry   Down,   Seven   Sisters   Road   (Site   Allocation   MH1)  
 
●
Yard   Buildings,   318   Green   Lanes   (Site   Allocation   MH2)

boroughwide   Characterisation   Study:  

 

## Pp10   Homerton Vision

4.97 Homerton  will  have  a  reinstated  historic  and  civic  heart, centred  around  key  


landmarks  including  St  Barnabas'  Church  The public  realm  will  be  enhanced,  


with  reactivated  frontages  and  improved  connections  along  Homerton  High  


Street,  and  from  Chatsworth  Road,  through  to  Homerton  Station  and  onto  Well  


Street.  Homerton  will  be  a  children  friendly  place  with  improved  settings  to  


green  spaces  and  children's  play.   New  and  existing  businesses  will  be 


supported  by  utilising  the industrial  heritage  and  important  employment  assets  


in   the   area.  

## Area  Character

4.98 Homerton  Ward  lies  on  the  eastern  side  of  Hackney  bordering  the  wards  of  


Hackney  Wick  and  Kings  Park  to  the  east  of  it.  This  area  includes  the  Homerton  

 


University  Hospital,  the  Borough's  second  biggest  employer  and  Sutton  House,  


which  was  built  in  1535  and  is  believed  to  be  the  oldest  house  in  East  London  

 


still   standing.  


4.99 Historically  the  home  of  many  factories  with  an  assortment  of  manufacturing  


occupying  the  majority  of  the  buildings,  


of  which  many  specialised  design  and  


fashion  manufacturing  firms  still  occupy  


a  number  of  the  older  commercial  


spaces   in   the   area.  


4.100 The  commencement  of  work  as  part  of  


the 
 Councils 
 estate 
 regeneration  


programme  on  both  Marian  Court  and  


Bridge 
 House 
 to 
 redevelop 
 and  


refurbish  both  estates  will  provide  


additional 
 dwellings 
 which 
 would  


include  a  mix  of  sizes  and  tenure  and 
 
  


supporting   uses.  


4.101 Though  Homerton  is  served  by  a  small  shopping  parade  between  Brooksby's  

 


Walk  and  Glyn  Road  as  well  as  a  cluster  of  shops  and  units  near  the  Homerton 

 


Overground  station,  the  area  is  located  in  close  proximity  to  the  Major  Centre  of  

 


Hackney  Central  to  its  west,  and  the  Local  Centres  of  Well  Street  to  the  south  


and   Chatsworth   Road   to   the   north.   
  
 
 
4.102 Development  opportunities  include  the  intensification  and  reinforcing  the  links  


between  Homerton  High  Street,  Homerton  Station  and  Chatsworth  Road.  This  


would  help  to  improve  accessibility  between  these  areas  and  open  up  


opportunities   to   intensify   existing   uses   in   the   area.   
  
 
 
4.103 Supporting  and  strengthening  the  employment  uses  in  the  Homerton  PIA  


located  to  the  south  of  Homerton  High  Street,  alongside  the  wider  evolution  of  


Homerton's  centre  will  be  important  in  repairing  and  reinforcing  the  urban  setting  

 


of   Homerton.  

## Urban  Design  Analysis

4.104 Homerton  High  Street  was  once  a  historic  and  fine  grained  commercial  street,  

 


functionally  linked  to  Hackney  Central,  Well  Street  and  Chatsworth  Road  by  


direct,  legible  streets.  Post-war  redevelopment  introduced  large  scale  social  


housing  blocks  set  back  from  and  disconnected  from  the  street  and  replaced  the  


historic  street  network.  While  this  redevelopment  introduced  a  sense  of  open  

 


space  and  greenery  to  an  area  that  was  uniformly  urban,  it  was  at  the  expense  

 


of   activity,   fine-grained   character,   legibility   and   street   activity.   
  
 
 
4.105 The  historic  core  of  Homerton  High  Street  was  centred  around  the  junction  of  


Brookby's  Walk  and  Homerton  High  Street  and  there  is  an  opportunity  to  repair  

 


the  townscape  here  to  create  a  new  focal  point  on  this  significant  point  between  

 


Homerton   Station   and   the   rest   of   the   area.  


4.106 Chatsworth  Road  and  Homerton  High  Street  have  a  weak  relationship  with  


Central  Hackney  possibly  due  to  the  unwelcoming  character  of  routes  linking  


these  neighbouring  centres.  There  is  an  opportunity  to  improve  the  character  of  

 


Homerton  High  Street  and  Homerton  Grove  as  walking  and  cycling  links.  There  


is  also  an  opportunity  to  reinstate  lost  street  connections  between  Lower  


Clapton   Road   and   Chatsworth   Road.   
  
 
 
4.107 Similarly ,  there  are  broken  connections  between  Homerton  Station  and  Well  


Street  local  centre.  These  routes  could  be  improved  as  part  of  any  future  


development   of   Council-owned   land.  


4.108 Direct  cycle  connections  through  the  area  are  poor  and  shared  with  traffic  


making  it  dangerous  to  cycle  on  main  roads.  There  is  an  opportunity  to  


introduce  dedicated  cycle  lanes  and  to  create  other  shared  pedestrian  and  


cycle-only  links,  for  example  along  Homerton  Grove.  This  could  be  achieved  by  


strategically  improving  access  to  Homerton  University  Hospital  to  take  the  


pressure   away   from  current   access   points.  

## Homerton  Urban  Design  Analysis


## Policy  Pp10  Homerton Strategic   Principles

Where   appropriate   development   should:   
  

●
Improve  the  character  of  Homerton  High  Street  by  introducing  more  


active   street   frontage.  
 
●
Diversify  the  uses  accommodated  on  Homerton  High  Street  by  


introducing  mixed-use  developments  with  commercial  units  at  ground  


floor.  
 
●
Improve  the  experience  of  walking  and  cycling  by  widening  pavements,  


introducing   dedicated   cycle   lanes   and   creating   public   open   spaces.  
 
●
Enhance  the  setting  of  heritage  assets.  New  buildings  should  respect  


the   historic   grain   and   building   line   of   the   street.  
 
●
Enhance  the  historic  core  of  Homerton  High  Street  around  the  church  


by  repairing  the  urban  fabric,  improving  the  setting  of  historic  buildings  


and   reconsidering   the   existing   public   realm.  
 
●
Consolidate  and  enhance  the  green  spaces  between  Homerton  


Hospital  and  Saint  Barnabas  Church  to  create  a  more  substantial  


public   space.  
 
●
Improve  the  character  of  links  between  Chatsworth  Road  and  Hackney  


Central.  Homerton  Grove  should  be  improved  as  an  actively  fronted,  


pedestrian   and   cycle   friendly   street.  
 
●
Improve  the  continuity  between  Chatsworth  Road  and  Homerton  High  


Street   by   introducing   active   street   frontage   and   improving   public   realm.  
 
●
Work  to  remove  the  gyratory  around  Wardle  Street  and  Saint  Barnabas  


Terrace  and  re-imagine  Saint  Barnabas  Terrace  as  a  pedestrian  public  

 
 
 
space.  
 
●
Create  a  better  balance  between  green  assets  and  active  street  


frontage   on   Homerton   High   Street.

## 5. Protecting   And   Enhancing   Heritage And   Leading   The  Way   In   Good   Urban Design

 
 
5.1 Hackney  is  an  extremely  popular  place  to  live,  work  and  visit.  The  combination  


of  the  Borough's  rich  history  and  the  diversity  of  its  people  have  evolved  into  a  

 
tapestry  of  streets  and  places  which  give  Hackney  its  unique  character.  Each  


neighbourhood 
 in 
 the 
 Borough 
 possesses 
 a 
 unique 
 historical 
 and  


socio-economic   character.  


5.2 The  National  Planning  Framework  sets  out  the  importance  of  good  design  in  


planning.  In  Hackney  we  value  our  rich  architectural  heritage  and  are  committed  


to  design  excellence  and  achieving  high  quality,  sustainable  development.  The  


Council  will  require  a  high  quality  of  design  for  all  buildings  and  spaces  in  the  

 


Borough  and  work  towards  making  Hackney  a  healthier  and  an  even  more  


attractive   place   to   live,   work   and   visit.   
  
 
 
5.3 The  Hackney  Characterisation  Study  sets  out  three  guiding  principles  to  help  us  


achieve  this  quality  of  development  in  the  Borough.  We  will  work  to  ensure  that  


development   :   
  
 
 
●
Reinforces    the   current   character   and   condition   
  
●
Repairs    the   historic   fabric  
 
●
Reinvents  local  character  through  development  which  is  informed  by  lost  

 


grain   
  
 
 
5.4 Hackney  has  a  rich  historic  environment  with  many  buildings  and  areas  of  


historic  and  architectural  value.  The  Borough  is  home  to  a  wealth  of  heritage  

 


assets   that   play   a   crucial   role   in   defining   its  character   and   sense   of   place.   
  

## Key  Facts:

5.5 Hackney   has:  
 
●
2   Scheduled   Monuments  
 
●
24   Archaeological   Priority   Areas   
  
●
Over   1,300   Listed   Buildings  
 
●
3   Registered   Parks   and   Gardens   of   historic   interest  
 
●
18   protected   London   Squares  
 
●
32   Conservation   Areas  
 
●
470   Locally   Listed   Buildings  
 

## Chapter  Objectives:

●
To  deliver  high  quality  urban  neighbourhoods  with  distinctive  architectural  


quality  which  respects  Hackney's  historic  character  whilst  producing  unique  


and  innovative  contemporary  design  that  reflects  Hackney's  innovative  and

## Lp1  Design  Quality  And  Local  Character

A. All  new  development  must  be  of  the  highest  architectural  and  urban  


design  quality.  Innovative  contemporary  design  will  be  supported  


where  it  respects  and  complements  historic  character.  Development  
  


will  be  permitted  if  all  of  the  following  criteria  are  met.  Development  

 


must:  
 
i. respond  to  local  character  and  context  having  regard  to  the  


boroughwide   Characterisation   Study;   and  
 
ii. be  compatible  with  the  existing  townscape  including  urban  grain  and  


plot   division;   and   
  
iii. be   compatible   with   local   views   and   preserve   protected   views;   and  
 
iv. preserve  or  enhance  the  significance  of  the  historic  environment  and  


the   setting   of   heritage   assets;   and   
  
v. incorporate  well  designed  and  integrated  landscape  design,  which  


enhances   biodiversity   and   maximises   opportunities   for   greening;   and  
 
vi. respond   positively   to   natural   features   and   other   open   space;   and   
  
vii. improve  the  public  realm,  frontage  to  the  street  and  facilitate  


movement  through  areas  with  direct,  safe,  accessible,  and  easily  


recognisable   routes   (legibility);   and  
 
viii. be   sustainable   in   design   and   construction;   and   
  
ix. be   adaptable,   robust   and   flexible   in   use;   and  
 
x. use  attractive,  durable  high  quality  materials  which  complement  local  


character;   and   
  
xi. thoughtfully  and  efficiently  integrate  building  services  equipment  and  


avoid  compromising  the  appearance  of  the  building,  including  the  


appearance   from  long   views;   and  
 
xii. avoid  value  engineering  and  maintain  quality  through  the  planning  


process   through   to   the   completion   of   the   development;   and  
 
xiii. contribute   positively   to   an   active   street   frontage;   and  
 
xiv. be   inclusive   and   accessible   for   all;   and  
 
xv. be  secure  and  designed  to  minimise  crime  and  antisocial  behaviour;  


and  
 
xvi. promote  good  health  by  creating  streets  and  spaces  which  are  


inclusive,  attractive  and  encourage  walking  and  cycling  through  the  


1

use   of   active   design   principles    and   the   Healthy   Streets   approach  .  
 

## Taller   Buildings

B. The  Council  will  prepare  development  plan  documents,  such  as  AAPs,  


to  provide  a  localised  planning  framework  for  each  of  the  places  


identified  in  the  Growth  Strategy  (PP2-PP10).  These  plans  will  include  


a  building  heights  strategy  for  each  place  and  where  appropriate  


identify  sites  and  locations  suitable  for  taller  buildings.  Masterplan  


Supplementary  Planning  Documents  will  be  produced  to  provide  


additional   guidance   where   necessary.  


C. Taller  buildings  will  be  assessed  using  the  design  criteria  set  out  in  


part  A  of  this  policy  and  against  the  following  criteria.  All  new  taller  


buildings  must  respect  the  setting  of  the  Borough's  local  character  and  


historic  townscapes  and  landscapes  including  those  in  adjoining  


boroughs.  Taller  buildings  will  only  be  permitted  where  they  meet  all  of  


the   following   criteria.   A   taller   building   must:  
 
i. have  a  legible  and  coherent  role  in  the  immediate  and  wider  context  
  


and  where  relevant  be  fully  justified  in  respect  of  the  Council's  place  


policy   vision   for   the   area;   and   
  
ii. relate  and  respond  to  its  immediate  and  wider  surrounding  context:  


the  base  of  the  building  must  enhance  the  existing  streetscape,  and  


the  top  of  a  tall  building  must  enhance  the  skyline;  be  of  exceptional  

 


design  quality  both  in  materiality  and  form  and  not  lead  to  


unacceptable  overshadowing  of  public  spaces,  especially  public  


open   spaces   and   watercourses/canals;   and   
  
iii. make   a   positive   contribution   to   the   quality   of   the   public   realm;   and  
 
iv. preserve  or  enhance 
 the  borough's  heritage  assets,  their  


significance,  and  their  settings  in  line  with  policies  LP3  `Designated  


Heritage   Assets'   and   LP4   `Non   Designated   Heritage   Assets'.   
  
v. not  constrain  development  potential  on  adjoining  sites  including  sites  


within   adjoining   boroughs.  


5.6 Hackney's  planning  policies  seek  to  create  buildings  and  places  of  high  quality  


that  will  be  appreciated  by  future  generations.  High  quality  design  is  both  


visually  interesting  and  attractive  and  should  enhance  local  character.  Good  


design  makes  places  that  put  people  first,  promote  health  and  are  welcoming,  


feel  safe,  are  enjoyable  and  easy  to  use  for  everyone.  The  requirements  of  


Policy  LP1  Part  A  will  be  applied  having  regard  to  the  scale  and  location  of  the  

 


development  and  other  site  specific  considerations.  The  Council  will  continue  to  


use  advice  from  the  Hackney  Design  Review  Panel  to  inform  the  decision  


making   process,  


5.7 A  series  of  key  considerations  have  been  identified  in  the  Hackney  


Characterisation  Study,  which  the  Council  will  use  to  assess  the  sensitivity  of  an  


individual  site  or  building  for  the  location  of  a  tall  building.  These  considerations  

 


include  the  impact  of  the  proposal  on  the  existing  urban  grain,  the  prevailing  


height  of  the  area,  the  public  transport  accessibility  of  the  site,  together  with  the  


impact  of  the  proposal  on  the  Borough's  built  heritage,  open  space  and  local  


views.  


5.8 In  Hackney  taller  buildings  are  defined  as  any  building  or  structure  which  is  taller  

 
 
than  its  neighbours  (50%  taller  than  the  prevailing  building  height)  or  which  


significantly  changes  the  skyline  or  is  30  metres  or  more  in  height.  Proposals  


will  be  considered  in  relation  to  their  context  and  likely  impacts  -  for  example  an  

 


area  characterised  by  buildings  of  six  storeys,  a  nine  storey  building  would  be  

 


considered  tall.  The  Council  will  make  an  assessment  at  the  pre-application  


stage  on  whether  a  proposal  is  considered  to  be  a  taller  building.  In  Hackney  

 

 


taller  buildings  will  generally  be  the  exception  to  the  prevailing  townscape.  

 
Applications  for  tall  buildings  will  also  be  assessed  using  the  London  Plan  Policy  


on  the  location  of  tall  buildings  and  the  Historic  England  Advice  note  4  on  tall  

 
 
 
buildings:   
  
https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/tall-buildings-advice-no te-4  
 

 
 
5.9 Further  development  plan  documents,  such  as  AAPs,  will  provide  further  


requirements  for  each  of  the  places  identified  in  the  Growth  Strategy  (Policies  


PP2  -  PP10).  These  are  areas  that  the  Characterisation  Study  identifies  as  
  


being  potentially  suitable  for  taller  buildings.  These  plans  will  include  a  building  

 
 
height  strategy  and  where  appropriate  identify  sites  suitable  for  taller  buildings  


for  each  area.  Taller  buildings  outside  of  growth  areas  will  only  be  permitted  


where  all  development  plan  criteria  are  met.  Very  tall  buildings,  of  30  metres  or  


more  in  height,  are  extremely  unlikely  to  meet  the  criteria  outside  of  these  areas.  
  


Masterplan   SPDs   will   provide   additional   guidance   where   necessary.  


5.10 The  Council  will  require  a  design  led  approach  to  identifying  appropriate  building  

 


heights.  Further  guidance  on  Hackney's  approach  to  building  heights  and  taller  


buildings   is   set   out   in   the   following:  


●
Hackney   Characterisation   Study  
 
●
Site   Allocations    (chapter   13)  
 
●
Conservation   Area   appraisals  


5.11 Hackney  is  a  dense  mixture  of  commercial  and  residential  in  the  south  and  a  
 
  

 
largely  residential  borough  in  the  extreme  north.  Each  neighbourhood  in  the  


Borough  possesses  a  unique  historical  and  socio-economic  character.  The  


boroughwide  Characterisation  Study  has  analysed  this  character  and  identified  


opportunities  to  densify  areas  across  the  Borough.  The  guiding  principles  set  out  


in  the  Characterisation  Study  aim  to  reinforce,  repair  and  reinvent  local  


character   and   promote   positive   growth   across   the   Borough.  
 

## Lp2  Development  And  Amenity

 
 
A. All  new  development  must  be  appropriate  to  its  location  and  should  be  


designed  to  ensure  there  are  no  significant  adverse  impacts  on  the  


amenity  of  occupiers  and  neighbours.  The  individual  and  cumulative  


impacts  of  development  proposals  on  amenity  will  be  considered  in  


assessing 
 their  acceptability.  Consideration  of  the  merits  of  


development  proposals  will  be  balanced  against  the  impact  on  


amenity.   
  
 
 
B. Amenity   considerations   include   the   impact   of   development   on:  
 
i. Visual   privacy   and   overlooking;  
 
ii. Overshadowing   and   outlook;  
 
iii. Sunlight   and   daylight,   and   artificial   light,   levels;  
 
iv. Vibration,   noise,   fumes   and   odour,   and   other   forms  of   pollution;   
  
v. Microclimate   conditions;  
 
vi. Safety   of   highway   users  


5.12 Hackney  seeks  to  sustainably  manage  growth  so  that  it  takes  place  in  the  most  

 


appropriate  locations,  meeting  the  Borough's  needs  while  continuing  to  


conserve  or  enhance  the  features  that  make  Hackney  an  attractive,  vibrant  and  


interesting  place  to  live,  work  and  visit.  Promoting  and  protecting  high  standards  


of  amenity  is  a  key  element  of  ensuring  sustainable  growth  and  the  continued  

 


regeneration  of  the  Borough,  and  will  be  a  major  consideration  when  the  Council  

 


assesses  development  proposals.  While  seeking  to  ensure  high  standards  of  


amenity,  the  environmental,  social  and  economic  benefits  that  development  can  


bring  need  to  be  weighed  up  proportionately  in  considering  proposed  


development   schemes.  
 

 
 
5.13 Amenity  can  be  compromised  in  a  number  of  ways  through  development,  such  

 


as  through  detrimental  loss  of  daylight  and  sunlight  to  existing  and  adjacent  


occupiers;  loss  of  privacy  and  outlook  due  to  the  proximity  and  design  of  


development;  harmful  noise,  odour,  vibration  and  air  pollution  from  existing  and  


proposed  developments,  typically  commercial  activities  and  other  activities  such  


as  rail;  conditions  with  potential  for  danger  to  highway  safety;  and  causing  


detrimental   microclimate   effects.  


5.14 The  design  and  layout  of  buildings  must  enable  sufficient  sunlight  and  daylight  


to  penetrate  into  and  between  buildings,  and  ensure  that  adjoining  land  or  


properties  are  protected  from  unacceptable  overshadowing.  The  Building  


Research  Establishment  (BRE)  provides  guidance  on  site  layout  planning  to  


achieve  good  sunlighting  and  daylighting  (BRE  Site  Layout  Planning  for  Daylight  


and  Sunlight:  a  guide  to  good  practice  2011).  The  Council  will  use  this  guidance  
 
  


to  assess  whether  acceptable  levels  of  daylight  and  sunlight  are  available  to  


habitable  spaces.  BRE  guidance  needs  to  be  applied  with  regard  to  the  site  


context.  Sunlight  and  daylight  target  criteria  as  found  in  the  BRE  guidance  have  

 


been  developed  with  lower  density  suburban  situations  in  mind.  In  denser  inner  


urban  contexts,  sunlight  and  daylight  levels  may  struggle  to  meet  these  target  

criteria  in  both  existing  and  proposed  situations.  The  target  criteria  will  therefore  


be  operated  flexibly  in  relation  to  planning  applications  in  dense  inner  urban  


locations   such   as   that   found   in   Hackney.  

## Historic  Environment

5.15 Hackney  is  proud  of  its  historic  character.  The  historic  environment  in  Hackney 


includes  archaeology;  historic  buildings,  structures  and  features;  historic  areas  


and  historic  landscapes.  All  new  development  in  Hackney  should  seek  to  


preserve,  and  where  appropriate  enhance  the  Borough's  designated  and  


non-designated  heritage  assets.  The  Council  will  pursue  a  positive  strategy  for  

 


the  conservation  and  enjoyment  of  the  historic  environment  by  implementing  


The  State  of  Hackney's  Historic  Environment  Report  (LBH,  2005)  and  


developing  a  Historic  Environment  Strategy  Supplementary  Planning  Document.  
  


The  Council  welcomes  proposals  that  address  Heritage  at  Risk.  Heritage  at  Risk  


will  be  addressed  by  liaising  with  Historic  England  to  update  the  Heritage  at  Risk  


register;  identifying  specific  opportunities  for  Heritage  at  Risk  to  contribute  to  


regeneration  and  place-making;  setting  out  strategies  for  repair  and  re-use;  


working  productively  with  building  owners,  third  sector  organisations  and  


sources  of  funding  (where  appropriate  and  possible)  to  find  solutions  to  


vulnerable  buildings;  and  managing  its  own  Heritage  at  Risk  to  prevent  


immediate   deterioration   and   to   bring   vacant   property   back   into   productive   use.  
 

 
 
5.16 National  policy  distinguishes  between  designated  and  non-designated  heritage  


assets.  Designated  heritage  assets  are  identified,  designated  and  conserved  


under  national  legislation.  They  include  Scheduled  Monuments,  World  Heritage  


Sites,  Listed  Buildings,  Registered  Parks  and  Gardens,  Conservation  Areas  and  


protected   London   Squares.  


5.17 Non  designated  heritage  assets  may  be  buildings,  other  structures  or  features  


and  historic  areas.  These  are  not  designated  under  national  legislation  but  are  


identified   by   the   Council.  

## Lp3  Designated  Heritage  Assets

A. Development  that  leads  to  substantial  harm  to  or  total  loss  of  


significance  of  a  designated  heritage  asset  will  not  be  permitted  unless  
 
  


it  can  be  demonstrated  that  the  substantial  harm  or  loss  is  necessary  

 
 
to  achieve  substantial  public  benefits  that  outweigh  that  harm  or  loss,  


or   all   of   the   following   apply:  
 
i. the  nature  of  the  heritage  asset  prevents  all  reasonable  uses  of  the  


site;   and  
 
ii. no  viable  use  of  the  heritage  asset  itself  can  be  found  in  the  medium  

 
 
 
term  through  appropriate  marketing  that  will  enable  its  conservation;  


and  
 
iii. conservation  by  grant-funding  or  some  form  of  charitable  or  public  


ownership   is   demonstrably   not   possible;   and  
 
iv. the  harm  or  loss  is  outweighed  by  the  benefit  of  bringing  the  site  back  

 


into   use. Development  that  leads  to  less  than  substantial  harm  to  significance  of  


a  designated  heritage  asset  will  not  be  permitted  unless  the  public  


benefit  of  the  proposal,  including  securing  the  optimum  viable  use  of  


the   site,   outweigh   the   harm.   
  

## B. **The   Setting   Of   World   Heritage   Sites**

Development  proposals  affecting  the  setting  of  a  World  Heritage  Site  

 


should:  
 

i. Conserve,  promote  and  enhance  the  Outstanding  Universal  Value  of  


the  World  Heritage  Site  (as  set  out  in  the  official  statement  of  


Outstanding  Universal  Value),  including  the  authenticity,  integrity  and  


significance  of  its  attributes,  and  support  its  management  and  

protection.  
 
ii. Not  compromise  the  ability  to  appreciate  its  Outstanding  Universal  


Value,   or   the   authenticity   and   integrity   of   its  attributes.  
 
iii. Be 
 supported 
 by 
 a 
 Heritage 
 Impact 
 Assessment.  
 Where  


development  proposals  may  contribute  to  a  cumulative  impact  on  a  

 

 
World  Heritage  Site  or  its  setting,  this  should  be  clearly  illustrated  and  


assessed   in   the   Heritage   Impact   Assessment.  

## C. **Listed   Buildings**

i. All   proposals   for   Listed   Buildings   should:  
 
a. Seek  to  conserve  and  enhance  significance  by  retaining,  repairing  


and  (where  appropriate)  reinstating  historic  features  and  fabric  in  a  

  
historically   correct   manner;   and  
 
b. Respect   the   historic   plan   form  and   hierarchies   of   space;   and  
 
c. Retain   roof   structures   of   architectural   or   historic   interest.  
 
ii.
Extensions  to,  and  new  development  in  the  curtilage  of,Listed 


Buildings    should:  
 
a. Be  subservient  to  the  host  historic  building  in  terms  of  location,  


floor   area,   height,   massing   and   scale;   and  
 
b. Respect  the  host  historic  building  in  terms  of  design,  materials  and  

 


detailing;   and  
 
c. Respect  the  unity  of  groups  of  buildings  (e.g.  terraces)  and  the  


setting   of   nearby   buildings;   and  
 
d. Respect  the  historic  character  and  extent  of  the  curtilage  in  


relation   to   the   amount   of   garden   or   other   open   space.  
 
iii. The  Council  will  only  permit  proposals  for  the  reinstatement  of  


historic  building  elements  (e.g.  roof  coverings,  rainwater  and  soil  


goods,  windows  and  doors)  where  the  replacement  uses  the  


traditional,   historic   or   original   material.  
 
iv. Proposals  for  the  change  of  use  of  a  Listed  Building  will  only  be  


permitted  where  it  can  be  demonstrated  that  the  proposed  use  is  the  
 
  

 
 
optimum  viable  use,  which  causes  the  least  harm  to  the  significance  


of   the   building   and   its  setting   and   secures   its  long   term  viability.  


D. **Registered   Parks   and   Gardens   and   Protected   London   Squares**  
 
Development  proposals  affecting  Historic  Parks,  Gardens  and  Squares  


should:  
 
i. Sustain  and  enhance  the  significance  of  the  landscape  and  its  


features  of  interest  (including  structures)  and  ensure  that  they  do  not  


detract  from  the  enjoyment,  layout,  design,  character,  appearance  or  


setting  of  the  park,  garden  or  square,  including  key  views  in  and  out;  

 
 
 
and  
 
ii. Take  opportunities  to  restore  historic  features,  or  not  compromise  


future   restoration   opportunities;   and  
 
iii. Protect   the   setting,   including   key   views   in   and   out.  

## E. **Conservation   Areas**

i. Development  proposals  affecting  Conservation  Areas  or  their  settings  


will  be  permitted  where  they  preserve  or  enhance  the  character  and  


appearance  of  the  area  including,  the  established  local  character  of  


individual  buildings  and  groups  of  buildings  (in  terms  of  height,  


massing,  scale,  form,  design,  materials,  detailing  and  use)  and  the  


rhythms  and  historical  form  of  the  area  (in  terms  of  the  spaces  


between  buildings,  density,  settings,  building  lines,  siting,  pattern  of  


development,   urban   grain   and   plot   coverage).  


5.18 The  legal  protection  afforded  by  legislation  to  Listed  Buildings  includes  all  of  the  


building,  both  externally  and  internally  and  is  not  confined  to  the  façade  or  to  the  

 


elements  mentioned  in  the  listing  description.  The  legal  protection  also  includes  


buildings  or  structures  which  form  part  of  the  Listed  Building  because  they  are  


attached   to   the   listed   building   or   within   its  curtilage.  


5.19 When  assessing  proposals  which  affect  a  Listed  Building  the  Council  will  have  

 


special  regard  to  the  desirability  of  preserving  the  building  or  its  setting  or  any  


features   of   special   architectural   or   historic   interest   which   it  possesses.   
  
 
 
5.20 Where  the  Council  considers  that  proposals  in  relation  to  works  to  a  listed  


building  may  have  a  structural  impact,  it  will  require  that  adequate  evidence  be  

 
 
  


provided  that  the  proposals  will  not  harm  the  structural  integrity  or  stability  of  the  


listed   building   or   that   of   adjoining   buildings   or   structures.  


5.21 The  legal  protection  afforded  to  Conservation  Areas  is  as  "areas  of  special  


architectural  or  historic  interest  the  character  or  appearance  of  which  it  is  

 
 
desirable  to  preserve  or  enhance".  The  significance  which  is  safeguarded  


therefore  includes  not  only  the  visual  appearance  of  these  historic  areas  and  the  


buildings   within   them,   but   their   character.  
 
  
  
5.22 The  character  of  the  area  should  be  identified  and  responded  to  in  the  design  of  

 


new  development.  Heritage  and  Design  and  Access  Statements  should  include  


an  assessment  of  local  context  and  character,  and  set  out  how  the  development  


has  been  informed  by  it  and  responds  to  it.  When  assessing  proposals  which  

 


affect  a  Conservation  Area  the  Council  will  pay  special  attention  to  the  


desirability  of  preserving  or  enhancing  the  character  or  appearance  of  that  area  


and   its  setting.  
 

 
 
5.23 The  full  or  substantial  demolition  of  buildings  or  structures  identified  as  making  a  

 
positive  contribution  to  the  significance  of  the  Conservation  Area  (e.g.  Buildings  


of  Townscape  Merit  or  Positive  Buildings)  is  clearly  harmful  to  the  heritage  asset  

 


(the  Conservation  Area).  The  Council's  Conservation  Area  Appraisals  routinely  


include  coloured  maps  which  show  the  positive  buildings  (often  labelled  


Buildings  of  Townscape  Merit). 
 Where  there  is  doubt,  please  contact  the  


Council   for   advice   on   whether   we   would   regard   a   building   as   positive.  


5.24 Development  proposals  in  Conservation  Areas  involving  façade  retention  only  


(with  the  demolition  of  the  remainder  of  the  building)  will  be  regarded  in  the  


same  way  as  proposals  for  the  full  or  substantial  demolition  of  a  building.  Such  

 
 
 
proposals  not  only  result  in  loss  of  the  historic  interest  of  the  building  but  can  be  


structurally   challenging   and   often   fail,   with   the   loss   of   the   entire   building.  


5.25 The  full  or  substantial  demolition  of  buildings  or  structures  identified  as  making  a  

 
positive  contribution  to  the  significance  of  the  Conservation  Area  (e.g.  Buildings  


of  Townscape  Merit  or  Positive  Buildings)  is  harmful  to  the  significance  of  


Conservation  Areas  and  will  be  regarded  as  substantial  harm  or  less  than  


substantial   harm   according   to   the   circumstances   of   the   case.  


5.26 The  Council  has  prepared  a  series  of  Conservation  Area  Appraisals  and  


Management  Plans  that  assess  and  analyse  the  character  and  appearance  of  


each  of  our  Conservation  Areas  and  set  out  how  we  consider  they  can  be  


preserved  or  enhanced  which  can  be  taken  into  account  when  assessing  


planning   applications   for   development   in   Conservation   Areas.  
  
 
 
5.27 Due  to  the  largely  dense  urban  nature  of  Hackney,  the  character  or  appearance  


of  our  Conservation  Areas  can  also  be  affected  by  development  which  is  outside  

 
 
of  conservation  areas,  but  visible  from  within  them.  This  includes  high  or  bulky  


buildings,  which  can  have  an  impact  on  areas  some  distance  away,  as  well  as  


adjacent  premises.  The  Council  will  therefore  not  permit  development  in  


locations  outside  Conservation  Areas  that  it  considers  would  cause  harm  to  the  

 


character,   appearance   or   setting   of   such   an   area.  

## Lp4  Non  Designated  Heritage  Assets

 
 
A. Development  proposals  affecting  non-designated  heritage  assets  


should  conserve  or  enhance  and  reveal  the  significance  of  the  assets  


and   their   settings.  


5.28 Hackney  has  long  benefitted  from  a  Local  List  which  details  Locally  Listed  


Buildings.  The  Local  List  was  thoroughly  revised  in  2012,  has  been  updated 


since  and  is  currently  (2018)  in  the  process  of  being  further  reviewed.  In  


practice,  the  list  has  included  buildings  (of  many  types  and  ages)  but  also  


structures  such  as  war  memorials,  statues,  plaques,  cattle  troughs,  historic  


bollards,  post  boxes,  telephone  boxes  and  even  murals.  Where  a  Non  


Designated  Heritage  Asset  is  identified  through  the  delivery  of  normal  planning  

 


duties,  the  criteria  used  will  be  those  published  on  the  Council's  website:  


https://www.hackney.gov.uk/locally-listed-buildings .   
  
 
 
5.29 The  Council  will  assess  the  impact  of  proposals  on  the  significance  of  a  


non-designated  heritage  asset.  When  considering  applications  that  affect  non  


designated  heritage  assets  (either  directly  or  in-directly),  the  Council  will  have  


regard  to  the  scale  of  any  harm  or  loss,  and  the  significance  of  the  heritage  


asset   when   making   a   balanced   planning   decision.  


5.30 Where  the  Non  Designated  Heritage  Asset  is  a  building  or  structure,  the  policy  

  


applies  to  all  of  the  building  or  structure,  both  externally  and  internally  and  is  not  

 
 
confined  to  the  façade  or  to  the  elements  mentioned  in  the  local  listing  


description.   
  

## Lp5  Strategic  And  Local  Views

 
 
A. The  Council  will  protect  strategic  views  which  extend  into  Hackney.  


New  development  located  within  the  Wider  Setting  Consultation  Area  


of  Linear  Views  8  and  9  of  the  London  Plan  (King  Henry's  Mound  to  St  

 
  


Paul's  Cathedral  and  Westminster  Pier  to  St  Paul's  Cathedral)  must  


not   harm   the   protected   views.  


B. Redevelopment  of  buildings,  which  currently  adversely  impact  on  the  


strategic  views,  must  not  further  detract  from,  and  where  possible,  


improve   the   views.  
 
C. The  Council  will  protect  the  identified  Important  Local  Views  within  


Hackney.    New   development   must   not   harm   Important   Local   Views.  


D. Redevelopment  of  buildings,  which  currently  adversely  impact  on  


Important  Local  Views,  must  not  further  detract  from,  and  shall,  where  


possible,   improve   the   view.  


5.31 The  Borough  falls  within  two  background  Wider  Setting  Consultation  Area  for  St  


Paul's  Cathedral  as  set  out  in  the  GLA's  London  View  Management  Framework  


Supplementary  Planning  Guidance.When  assessing  the  potential  impact  of  


proposed  schemes  on  strategically  important  landmarks  and  views,  the  policies  


and  guidance  of  relevant  neighbouring  authorities  and  the  Council's  planning  


policies,   AAPs   and   other   guidance   will   be   taken   into   considerations.  


5.32 Important   Local   Views   can   include   the   following:   
  
 
 
●
Views  of  Heritage  Assets,  including  where  the  asset  would  be  back  


dropped;   and  
 
●
Views  of  and  within  Conservation  Areas  identified  as  significant  in  the  


relevant   Conservation   Area   Appraisal;   and  
 
●
The   views   identified   in   the   Hackney   Characterisation   Study   (LBH,   2018).  


5.33 The  Council  will  monitor  and  review  the  views  of  local  importance  across,  into  


and   out   of   the   Borough.   
  

## Lp6  Archaeology

 
 
A. All  new  development  must  protect,  or  enhance,  and  promote  

archaeological  heritage  (both  above  and  below  ground).  The  


interpretation  and  presentation  of  archaeological  heritage  to  the  public  


will  be  encouraged.  Proposals  that  would  adversely  affect  nationally  


important   archaeological   remains   or   their   setting   will   be   refused.  
 


B. Where  development  is  proposed  on  sites  of  archaeological  significance  
 
  


or  potential  significance,  desk  based  assessments  and,  where  


necessary,  archaeological  field  evaluation,  will  be  required  before  

development   proposals   are   determined.  


C. Scheduled   Monuments      (Designated   Heritage   Assets)  
 
i. Works  affecting  Scheduled  Monuments  (including  repair  works)  are  


subject  to  a  statutory  consent  regime  administered  by  Historic  


England   on   behalf   of   the   Secretary   of   State.  
 
ii. Scheduled  Monuments  are  also  Designated  Heritage  Assets  and  the  


Council  will  apply  the  relevant  national  planning  policies,  particularly  


in   relation   to   development   affecting   the   setting   of   a   monument.  

## D. **Non-Designated   Heritage   Assets**

i. Where  non-designated  heritage  assets  of  archaeological  interest  are  


demonstrably  of  equivalent  significance  to  Scheduled  Monuments,  


the  Council  will  regard  them  as  Designated  Heritage  Assets  and  


apply   the   relevant   national   planning   policies.  
 
5.34 The  Borough's  Archaeological  Priority  Areas  (APAs)  were  reviewed  in  2017  by  


the  Greater  London  Archaeological  Advisory  Service  (GLAAS)  as  part  of  a  


rolling  programme  of  reviews  across  London.  The  Council  will  therefore  provide  


a  link  to  the  latest  available  APA's  map.  APA's  are  now  divided  into  four  tiers  


(1-4)  indicating  different  degrees  of  sensitivity  to  groundworks.  Tier  1  is  defined  

  
 
as  an  area  containing  or  strongly  suspected  to  contain  a  heritage  asset  of  


national  significance.  Hackney  contains  all  3  tiers  in  key  locations  across  the  

 


Borough   and   the   whole   Borough   is   Tier   4.  


5.35 Historic  England's  GLAAS  is  the  Borough's  archaeological  adviser.  Prospective  

 


applicants  should  make  an  initial  assessment  of  the  archaeological  potential  and  


significance  of  a  site  and  the  likely  impact  of  the  proposed  development  by  


consulting  the  Hackney  Archaeological  Priority  Area  Review  and  GLAAS  


published  guidelines.  If  a  potential  archaeological  interest  is  identified  then  


GLAAS  should  be  consulted  with  regard  to  archaeological  matters.  If  a  


Scheduled  Monument  or  its  setting  is  affected  then  Historic  England's  Inspector  

 


of   Ancient   Monuments   should   be   consulted.

## Lp7  Advertisements

A. New  advertisements  must  be  of  the  highest  standard  of  design  and  


respect   local   character   and   context.   


B. Applications  for  advertisement  consent  will  only  be  permitted  where  


they   meet   all   of   the   following   criteria.   The   advertisement   must   not:  
 
i. adversely  affect  the  historic  significance  of  buildings,  and  be  sensitive  


to  the  character  of  an  area  through  size  and  siting,  especially  those  


areas   of   historic   significance;   and  
 
ii. contribute  to  an  unsightly  proliferation  or  clutter  of  signage  in  the  local  

 
 
 
area  and  detract  from  the  amenity  of  the  street  scene;  cause  a  


physical  obstruction  to  the  public  realm;  and  cause  visual  intrusion  by  


virtue  of  light  pollution  into  adjoining  residential  properties,  and  avoid  


flashing   internal   or   external   illumination.  


5.36 Advertisements  can  greatly  affect  the  appearance  of  an  area.  The  Borough's  


town  centres  are  a  focus  for  advertising,  and  the  visual  appearance  of  key  


shopping  centres  are  an  important  influence  on  their  performance  and  


attraction.  


5.37 Advertising  hoardings  and  stand-alone  boards  can  detract  from  townscape  


quality,  compromise  public  safety  and  lead  to  a  poor  visual  environment  within  

 


their  immediate  vicinity.  Poorly  located  advertising  hoardings  can  be  unsightly  


and  an  incongruous  feature  in  areas  where  there  is  a  unified  architectural  or  

 


landscape  character.  In  particular,  the  amenity,  character  and  quality  of  heritage  


assets  and  the  wider  historic  environment  can  be  adversely  affected  by  signage  


and  by  advertisement  hoardings.  However,  in  some  locations,  advertisements  


may  add  colour  and  interest  to  an  area,  act  as  a  sound  barrier,  and  screen  

 


unpleasant  views  such  as  where  a  building  or  site  is  under  long  term  


construction   /   refurbishment.  


5.38 The  Council  considers  it  important  to  control  and  manage  advertisements  in  

 


terms  of  their  number,  size,  design,  siting  or  illumination,  so  they  do  not  lead  to  


substantial  harm  to  the  significance  and  appearance  of  buildings  or  local  


character,  areas,  or  add  clutter  to  an  already  busy  street  scene  thus  adversely  


affecting  the  local  environment  blocking  the  public  realm  and  in  some  cases  


affecting   highway   safety. 
  

## 6.     Hackney'S   People

6.1 Hackney  is  more  than  just  a  place  to  live  and  work.  We  need  to  plan  for  a  wide  
  

 

 
 
range  of  facilities  such  as  health,  education,  culture,  sports,  leisure  facilities,  


places  of  worship  and  our  emergency  services  to  meet  our  needs.  The  Council  


also  needs  to  plan  for  the  delivery  of  utilities  and  digital  connectivity  


infrastructure   to   ensure   capacity   meets   future   demand   up   to   2033.   
  

## Key  Facts:

●
The  school  age  population  is  projected  to  increase  between  now  and  2033.  

 


There  will  be  a  need  to  plan  for  new  primary  and  secondary  school  places  

 


in   the   longer-term.  
 
●
Growth  will  increase  pressure  on  existing  health  and  community  facilities  


and   there   will   be   a   need   to   increase   capacity   within   the   plan   period.  
 
●
Hackney  has  some  of  the  highest  childhood  obesity  rates  in  the  country,  


and  tackling  obesity  and  improving  general  health  and  well-being  is  a  


priority.  42%  of  Year  6  children  in  the  City  and  Hackney  Clinical  


Commissioning   Group   (CCG)   area   are   either   overweight   or   obese.   
  

## Chapter  Objectives:

●
To  tackle  health  inequalities,  create  an  environment  that  promotes  health  


and   well-being,   and   enable   skills   development   and lifelong   learning.  
 

## Lp8  Social  And  Community  Infrastructure

 
 
A. The   Council,   in   partnership   with   service   providers,   will   plan   for   the   
following   infrastructure   up   to   2033:  
 
●
Education      
 
●
Health   and   Social   Care   Facilities   
  
●
Sport   and   Leisure   Facilities  
 
●
Libraries,   Museums   and   Archives  
 
●
Youth   Facilities  
 
●
Community   Facilities  
 
●
Cultural   Facilities  
 
 
B. Proposals  for  social  and  community  infrastructure  will  be  permitted  


where   they   meet   all   of   the   following   criteria:  
i. meet   the   current   or   future   identified   need;   and   
  
ii. are  of  a  high  quality  and  inclusive  design  providing  access  for  all;  
 
  


and   
  
iii. provide  flexible,  affordable  and  adaptable  buildings  and,  where  


possible,  provide  mixed  used  development,  co-located  with  other  


social  infrastructure  uses  and  maximise  use  of  buildings  in  evenings  

 
 
and   at   weekends.  


C. Facilities  should  be  located  in  places  that  are  accessible  by  walking,  


cycling   or   public   transport   for   its  end   users.  


D. Proposals  involving  the  loss  of  existing  social  and  community  


infrastructure  will  be  permitted  where  one  of  the  following  criteria  is  


met:  
 
i. a  replacement  facility  of  equivalent  or  better  quality  that  meets  the  


needs   currently   met   by   the   existing   facility   is   provided;   or  
 
ii. it  has  been  demonstrated,  as  evidenced  by  at  least  a  year  of  active  

 


marketing,  that  the  facility  is  no  longer  required  in  its  current  use  and  

 

 


it  has  been  demonstrated  that  it  is  not  suitable  and  viable  for  any  

 


other  forms  of  social  infrastructure  for  which  there  is  a  defined  need  

  
 
 
in  the  locality,  or  for  which  there  is  a  current  or  future  need  identified  

  


in   the   Infrastructure   Needs   Assessment   and   Delivery   Plan   (IDP).  


E. The  incorporation  of  community  facilities  into  mixed  use  residential  


schemes   where   it  meets   an   identified   need   will   be   permitted.  


F. New  development  should  have  regard  to  existing  social  infrastructure  


capacity,  and  where  proposed  development  is  expected  to  place  


additional  pressure  on  existing  social  infrastructure  by  increasing  


demand,  these  developments  will  be  expected  to  contribute  towards  


the  provision  of  additional  social  infrastructure  to  meet  needs,  either  


through  on-site  provision  or  through  contributions  towards  providing  


additional   capacity   off-site.   
  


6.2 Social  infrastructure  covers  a  broad  range  of  facilities  including  schools,  


childcare  facilities,  adult  education,  health  services,  places  of  worship,  libraries,  


youth  facilities,  sport  and  leisure  facilities,  public  houses,  community  and  


cultural  services  and  policing  amongst  others,  all  of  which  contribute  to  the  


quality  of  life  and  well-being  of  the  population.  The  protection,  enhancement,  


and  provision  of  additional  social  infrastructure  is  supported  by  policies  outlined  

 


in   the   London   Plan,   and   the   National   Planning   Policy   Framework.   
  
 
 
6.3 Given  the  projected population  growth  in  Hackney  and  the  change  in  the  profile  

 
 
 
of  future  residents,  there  will  be  the  need  to  protect,  improve  and  provide  new  


social  and  community  facilities  to  ensure  adequate  provision  and  enhancement  


to  meet  the  changing  needs  of  Hackney's  community.  The  Council  maintains  an  


IDP  to  assess  existing  provision  of  social  infrastructure  facilities  and  to  set  out  


the  types  and  quantities,  as  well  as  specific  locations  where  this  can  be  


determined,  of  social  and  community  infrastructure  required  to  support  growth  in  

 
Hackney   over   the   Plan   period.  


6.4 In  regularly  updating  the  Infrastructure  Needs  Assessment  and  Delivery  Plan  


(IDP)  the  Council  will  engage  with  and  use  information  from  service  providers  


such  as  the  Learning  Trust,  City  and  Hackney  CCG,  Emergency  Services,  other  


Council  departments  and  relevant  social  infrastructure  providers,  as  well  as  the  


voluntary  and  community  sectors.  The  2018  IDP  has  identified  the  need  for  


additional  GP  capacity  within  the  Borough  up  to  2033,  a  number  of  important  

 


accessibility  improvements  to  the  Borough's  transport  infrastructure  alongside  


improved  cycling  and  walking  infrastructure,  new  sports  halls  and  swimming  


pools,  and  a  suite  of  improvements  to  the  Borough's  open  spaces  amongst  


other  infrastructure  requirements.  The  Council  will  work  with  the  relevant  


stakeholders  to  encourage  the  provision  and  design  of  flexible  community  


facilities  that  can  accommodate  a  range  of  needs,  where  appropriate.  


Furthermore,  beyond  the  scope  of  the  general  admission  education  assessment  


of  the  IDP,  the  Council  is  aware  that  there  will  be  an  increasing  need  over  the  


Plan  period  for  additional  places  in  faith  schools  in  the  Stamford  Hill  area.  


Additional  analysis  to  be  carried  out  will  identify  infrastructure  needs  on  a  more  

 
 
localised   basis   and   for   specific   community   groups.   
  
 
 
6.5 The  Stamford  Hill  and  Shoreditch  AAPs  will  also  set  out  an  approach  to  meet  


particular  needs  for  facilities  in  their  respective  areas.  Requirements  for  


locally-specific  social  infrastructure  may  also  be  identified  by  communities,  for  


example,      AAPs   or    the   Neighbourhood   Planning   process.  
 
  
6.6 If  D  (ii)  applies,  evidence  must  be  required  to  show  that  the  loss  would  not  


create,  or  add  to,  a  shortfall  in  provision  for  the  specific  social  infrastructure  use  

 


and  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  demand  for  any  other  suitable  social  


infrastructure  use  on  the  site.  The  applicant  must  demonstrate  that  all  


reasonable  efforts  have  been  made  to  preserve  the  facility  and  should  provide  1  

 
year   of   marketing   evidence   which   follows   the   guidelines   outlined   in   Appendix   1.   
  

## Lp9  Health  And  Wellbeing

A. New  development  that  contributes  to  a  high  quality  environment  that  

 


enables  all  Hackney  residents  to  lead  healthier  and  active  lifestyles  


and  reduce  health  inequalities  will  be  supported,  subject  to  all  other  


plan   policies.  


B. New   development   will   be   permitted   where   it  is:  
 
i. Designed  to  promote  mental  and  physical  activity  and  well-being,  


and  reduce  environmental  factors  which  can  contribute  to  poor  


health,  through  appropriate  arrangement 
 of  buildings  and  uses,  


access,  open  space  and  landscaping,  the  provision  of  facilities  to  


support  walking  and  cycling,  and  schemes  must  meet  'Secured  by  


Design'   principles   where   feasible;   and   
  
ii. Integrated  with  the  public  realm  and  public  transport,  and  in  


particular  ensures  that  local  facilities  and  services  are  easily  


accessible   by   foot   or   bicycle.  


C. Major  schemes  of  50  housing  units  or  more,  non-residential  


developments  of  10,000  sqm  or  more,  and  proposals  for  takeaways,  


betting  shops  and  payday  loan  shops  of  any  size  will  be  required  to  


submit   a   Health   Impact   Assessment   (HIA).  


D. Large-scale  commercial  developments  in  major  town  centres  and  


highly  accessible  locations  should  incorporate  free  drinking  fountains,  


seating  and  free  publicly-accessible  toilets  as  part  of  the  development  


and   provide   for   the   long   term  maintenance   of   facilities.   
  


6.7 The  built  environment  can  help  influence  changes  in  lifestyle  and  help  achieve  


positive  health  outcomes.  The  Council  will  seek  to  secure  a  local  environment  

 
 
 
which  promotes  physical  activity  and  mental  well-being  through  new  


development,  and  seek  to  improve  people's  economic,  social  and  environment  


conditions.   
  
 
 
6.8 Schemes  below  the  threshold  for  a  HIA  will  be  required  to  identify  potential  

 


impacts  on  health  and  well-being  and  demonstrate  how  these  will  be  addressed  


through  a  Design  and  Access  Statement.  Applicants  are  encouraged  to  discuss  
  


proposals   at   the   pre-application   stage   with   the   Council's  Public   Health   Team.  

 

## Lp10  Arts,  Culture  And  Entertainment  Facilities

A. New  major  development  of  arts,  culture  and  entertainment  facilities  


must  be  located  within  the  Central  Activities  Zone,  and  major  and  


district   centre   locations.  


B. Smaller  scale  proposals  will  be  permitted  in  areas  that  are  accessible  


by  public  transport  and  walking  and  cycling  routes  by  those  that  are  


likely   to   use   the   facility.  


C. The  dual  use  of  sites  for  a  mix  of  arts-  and  culture-related  uses  and 

 


use  of  vacant  units  in  highly  accessible  areas  and  town  centre  


locations   for   temporary   arts   related   activities   will   be   permitted.  


D. Development  involving  the  loss  of  arts,  culture  and  entertainment  


facilities  will  be  resisted,  unless  re-provided  in  accordance  with  other  


policy  requirements.  Where  loss  of  the  facility  is  necessary  to  secure  a  

 

 
development  which  will  deliver  wider  planning  benefits  for  the  


community,  and  this  can  be  demonstrated  to  the  Council's  satisfaction,  


a  contribution  towards  cultural,  public  art  or  creative  projects  should  be  


provided  in  accordance  with  the  Council's  Planning  Contributions  


SPD.  


6.9 The  contribution  of  arts,  culture  and  entertainment  is  significant  to  Hackney's  


community  needs,  economic  development,  vitality  and  regeneration.  There  are  


a  significant  number  of  artists,  designers  and  other  creative  professionals,  and  


the  creative  industries  contribute  strongly  to  the  local  economy.  The  Borough  


hosts  a  wide  range  of  festivals  including  Hackney's  Space  Festival,  and  


Hackney  Fringe  Festival  which  attract  a  large  number  of  visitors.  There  are  a  

 

 
number  of  art  galleries,  such  as  The  White  Cube  gallery,  museums  including  the  


Geffrye  Museum  and  Sutton  House,  and  theatres  including  Hackney  Empire  


and   the   Arcola   Theatre.  


6.10 Public  art  brings  a  wide  range  of  benefits  to  the  whole  community,  from  the  

 


economic  benefits  that  high-quality  art  brings  to  the  developer,  to  the  


educational  opportunities  inherent  both  in  the  creation  of  and  reflection  upon  


public  art.  Art  can  help  in  the  process  of  regeneration,  fostering  social  inclusion  


and  community  involvement.  Public  art  can  also  contribute  to  the  Borough's  


streetscape.  


6.11 Dalston,  Hackney  Central  and  the  emerging  Stamford  Hill  and  Shoreditch  AAPs  


place  a  strong  emphasis  on  the  provision  of  facilities  in  those  areas,  building  on  
  

 


the  existing  strong  presence  of  these  activities.  Shoreditch,  partly  within  the  


CAZ  contained  within  the  London  Plan,  has  a  strong  existing  arts  and  culture  

 


presence.  


6.12 Proposals  outside  of  the  Borough's  designated  centres  must  meet  the  


sequential   approach   outlined   in   Policy   LP32   (Town   Centres).  
 

## Lp11  Utilities  And  Digital  Connectivity  Infrastructure Utilities:

A. As  part  of  any  major  residential  and  commercial  schemes  it  will  be  

 
 
 
required  to  demonstrate,  in  conjunction  with  utility  providers,  that  there  


will  be  adequate  utility  infrastructure  capacity  in  place  before  the  


development   is   completed.   
  
 
 
B. Utility  infrastructure  and  connections  must  be  designed  into  and  


integrated   with   the   development   wherever   possible.   
  
 
 
C. Utilities  infrastructure  provision  must  be  completed  prior  to  occupation.  


Where  potential  capacity  problems  are  identified  and  no  improvements  


are  programmed  by  the  utility  company,  the  Council  will  require  the 


developer   to   facilitate   appropriate   improvements. Digital   Connectivity:  
 
D. To  ensure  homes  and  businesses  are  well  connected,  all  new 


residential   and   commercial   development   schemes   should:  
 
i. Ensure  that  sufficient  ducting  space  for  future  digital  connectivity  


infrastructure   is   provided;   
  
ii. Maximise   opportunities   to   provide   affordable   digital   connectivity;  
 
iii. Support  the  effective  use  of  the  public  realm  to  accommodate  


well-designed   and   located   mobile   digital   infrastructure  


E. Major  developments  should  achieve  greater  digital  connectivity  speeds  


than  set  out  in  Part  R1  of  the  Building  Regulations  and  where  possible  


achieve  connectivity  speeds  set  out  in  the  Council's  most  recent  


Infrastructure   Delivery   Plan.   
  
F. Minor  residential  and  commercial  development  schemes  must  aim  to  


exceed  the  minimum  requirements  set  out  in  Part  R1  of  the  Building  


Regulations   unless   it  can   be   demonstrated   that   this   is   not   feasible.  

6.13 The  continued  expansion  of  high  quality  and  reliable  communications  


infrastructure  is  essential  for  economic  growth  and  social  well-being.  A  digital  

 
 
connection  is  now  widely  seen  as  an  everyday  essential  alongside  traditional  


utilities  such  as  water,  energy  and  waste  management.  There  has  also  been  a  

 
rise  in  businesses  operating  out  of  homes  and  more  people  working  remotely  


which  highlights  the  importance  of  affordable  digital  connectivity  infrastructure  to  


the  economy.  This  policy  seeks  to  ensure  that  all  new  developments  enable  


next-generation  mobile  technology  (such  as  5G)  and  full-fibre  broadband  


connections   to   the   premises   are   incorporated.   
  
  

## Meeting Hackney'S Housing Need 7

 

## 7.     Meeting   Hackney'S   Housing   Need

 
 
7.1 With  a  growing  population,  delivering  good  quality,  genuinely  affordable  homes  
  


to  meet  the  needs  of  the  Hackney's  existing  and  future  households  is  a  key  

 
 
challenge  for  the  new  Plan.  House  prices  in  Hackney  have  more  than  doubled  


over  the  past  10  years  (rising  71%  in  the  last  5  years)  as  Hackney  has  become  

 


a  much  more  desirable  place  to  live,  and  increased  housing  demand  has  


contributed  to  spiraling  house  prices  and  rents.  In  the  face  of  increased  


demand,  the  supply  of  housing  in  London  across  all  tenures  has  not  kept  pace.  


The  following  policies,  along  with  the  Council's  Housing  Strategy,  seek  to  


address  this  issue  by  increasing  the  supply  of  new  housing  in  the  Borough,  


especially   of   homes   that   are   genuinely   affordable.  

## Key  Facts:

●
Hackney,  in  partnership  with  the  GLA  have  identified  capacity  to  deliver  a  

 
minimum  of  1,330  new  homes  per  year  between  2019  and  2029,  however  


the  Council  are  looking  at  ways  to  increase  this  through  various  means.  An  


average  of  1,794  new  homes  per  annum  were  delivered  in  Hackney  


between   2012   and   2017.   
  
●
The  average  price  of  a  2  bed  flat  in  Hackney  is  around  £587,000.  The  

  


average   house   price   is   17   times   the   average   earning   of   a   household.  
 
●
The   cost   of   renting   in   Hackney   has   increased   by   over   30   %   since   2011.  
 

## Chapter  Objectives:

●
To  deliver  26,250  additional  homes,  increasing  the  supply  of  genuinely  


affordable  homes,  alongside  community  facilities  to  meet  existing  and  


future   needs.  
 

## Lp12  Meeting  Housing  Needs  And  Locations  For  New Homes

 
 
A. The  Council  will  plan  to  deliver  a  minimum  of  1,330  homes  per  year  up  

 


to  2033  by  encouraging  development  on  small  sites  and  through  


allocating  sites  for  residential  use,  increasing  the  supply  of  genuinely  


affordable  homes,  alongside  community  facilities  through  high  quality  


urban  neighbourhoods,  to  meet  Hackney's  needs.  Housing  growth  is  


planned  to  take  place  in  and  around  Shoreditch  (7,000  homes),  in  the  

 
 
north  of  the  Borough  at  Woodberry  Down/Stamford  Hill  (around  3,000  


homes),  around  Dalston  (around  2,000  homes)  and  Hackney  Central  


(around  3,000  homes),  and  along  the  Borough's  Enhanced  Corridors  


identified   in   Map   1:   Key   Diagram.   
  

 B. The  Council  will  create  the  conditions  for  growth  and  to  seek  to  meet  


the  identified  housing  need  of  1,750  new  homes  per  year  by  2033  by  


bringing  forward  new  growth  areas  such  as  Clapton,  Homerton  and  


along   key   growth   areas/corridors. C. The  Council  will  support  the  development  of  small  sites  to  meet  the  


housing  need.  Infill  housing  development  and  innovative  approaches  


to  housing  delivery  on  small  sites  will  be  supported  subject  to  meeting  


other   development   plan   policies. D. Self-contained  residential  units  are  the  priority  residential  land  use  in  


the  Borough  and  type  of  land  use  for  which  there  is  the  greatest  need.  

 


Proposals  involving  the  provision  of  other  forms  of  residential  


accommodation  including  student  housing,  visitor  accommodation  and  


alternative  forms  of  accommodation  will  only  be  permitted  where  


applicants  can  demonstrate  that  it  is  not  feasible  to  deliver  C3  


residential   development   on   site.   
  


7.2 The  identified  housing  need  for  the  Borough  during  the  plan  period  is  26,250  


new  homes  (1,750  homes  per  year).  Hackney,  in  partnership  with  the  GLA,  has  


identified  capacity  to  deliver  1,330  homes  each  year  between  2019  and  2029.  


This  equates  to  a  requirement  for  19,950  homes  over  the  15  year  plan  period.  

 


In  line  with  the  growth  strategy  and  informed  by  the  Council's  housing  trajectory,  


it  is  projected  that  around  35%  of  the  housing  growth  will  be  delivered  in  and  


around  Shoreditch,  around  15%  in  Hackney  Central,  10%  in  Dalston,  and  15%  


around  Woodberry  Down  and  Stamford  Hill.  Further  growth  will  be  delivered  


along   the   key   corridors   and   new   growth   areas   such   as   Clapton   and   Homerton.   
  
 
 
7.3 Almost  half  of  this  delivery  is  expected  to  come  from  small  sites.  Small  sites  can  

 


make  an  important  contribution  to  meeting  the  housing  requirement  of  an  area,  


with  an  advantage  being  that  they  are  often  built-out  relatively  quickly.  Hackney  


is  on  track  to  meet  the  new  London  Plan  target  but  is  also  looking  at  ways  to  


bring   forward   more   sites   for   development   to   meet   the   housing   need.   
  
 
 
7.4 Hackney's  local  housing  needs  assessment  identifies  a  significant  need  for  


self-contained  housing  in  excess  of  the  housing  targets  set  by  the  London  Plan.  


Self-contained  homes  also  have  the  greatest  potential  and  flexibility  to  provide  


for  a  range  of  needs.  Purpose-built  student  housing,  visitor  accommodation  and  
  


shared  housing  compete  directly  for  a  limited  land  supply  with  conventional  


self-contained  housing.  The  Council  is  therefore  prioritising  the  delivery  of  C3  


self-contained  housing  over  those  uses  and  will  encourage  the  delivery  of  


housing   on   other   schemes   where   appropriate.   
  

## Lp13  Affordable  Housing

A. New  development  must  maximise  opportunities  to  supply  genuinely  


affordable  housing  on-site.  The  Council  will  seek  the  maximum  


reasonable  amount  of  affordable  housing,  subject  to  viability  and  site  


context.   
  
 
 
B. Affordable  housing  requirements  are  not  limited  to  Class  C3  in  the  Use  

 
 
 
Classes  Order  and  will  be  sought  from  alternative  housing  products  


and  developments  such  as  purpose-built  shared  housing  (e.g.  


co-living),   supported   and   specialist   housing   and   student   housing.  
  
 
 
1. **Schemes   of   10   units   or  more:**  
 
i. A  minimum  50%  of  housing  delivered  will  be  sought  as  on-site  


affordable   housing,   subject   to   the   requirements   set   out   in   part   A;   
  
ii. Schemes  meeting  or  exceeding  50%  genuinely  affordable  housing  


(in  accordance  with  iv.  below)  will  not  be  required  to  submit  viability  


information.  
 
iii. Schemes  that  propose  less  than  50%  on-site  affordable  housing  will  


be  required  to  submit  a  detailed  viability  assessment  and  will  be 


subject   to   early   and   late   review   mechanisms.    

iv. Conventional  C3  housing  schemes  will  need  to  deliver  affordable  

housing   in   accordance   with   the   following   tenure   split:  
 

 
Affordable  Housing    
Type   of affordable   
  
Tenures  
 
housing   
  
Social   Rent/London  
Social  
 
60%  
 
Affordable   Rent  
Hackney/London  
Intermediate  
 
40%  
 
Living   Rent   or  
London   Shared  
Ownership   or   other  
genuinely   affordable  

Proportion   required  
 

products   that   the  
Council   considers  
appropriate  
 

v. Other  affordable  housing  tenure  to  those  outlined  in  B1.iv  will  be  


permitted  where  it  can  be  demonstrated  to  be  genuinely  affordable  
 
  


relative   to   local   ward   level   incomes.  
 
vi. Off-site  affordable  housing  or  payments  in-lieu  will  only  be  


considered  in  truly  exceptional  circumstances  where  the  Council  is  


satisfied  that  off-site  provision  would  secure  a  better  outcome  in  


meeting  the  housing  need.  Off-site  affordable  housing  and  payments  


in  lieu  will  be  required  to  be  equivalent  to  the  50%  requirement,  


subject   to   viability.  

## 2. **Schemes   Of   1-9   Units:**

i. Schemes  which  fall  below  the  10  unit  threshold  will  be  required  to  


provide  on-site  provision  or  payments  in  lieu  up  to  the  equivalent  of  


50%  of  housing  delivered  as  affordable  housing,  subject  to  viability.  


Further  guidance  will  be  set  out  in  the  Hackney  Housing  SPD  and  


Planning   Contributions   (S106)    SPD.   
  
C.  Where  additional  homes  are  proposed  through  amended  planning  


applications  (i.e.  through  re-submissions  or  variations  of  existing  


planning  applications  or  submission  of  a  new  planning  application  for  

 


an  extension  resulting  in  an  increase  in  homes  delivered)  within  four  


years  of  the  commencement  of  the  original  planning  permission,  


affordable  housing  requirements  stated  in  the  rest  of  this  policy  will  


apply   to   the   total   number   of   net   new   homes. D.  Where  development  sites  are  split,  or  separate  proposals  are  brought  


forward  on  neighbouring  or  nearby  sites  which  are  physically  or  


functionally  linked,  affordable  housing  requirements  will  be  assessed  


on  the  total  number  of  net  residential  units  proposed  across  all  related  


sites.  


7.5 Maximising  the  delivery  of  genuinely  affordable  homes  remains  one  of  the  


biggest  challenges  facing  the  Plan.  On  sites  of  10  or  more  residential  units,  


applicants  must  provide  50%  affordable  housing  on-site,  which  could  be  


part-funded  by  public  subsidy.  It  is  not  necessary  for  applicants  to  submit  


detailed   viability   assessments   where   the   50%   threshold   is   met   or   exceeded.  


7.6 Sites  of  10  or  more  residential  units  that  provide  less  than  the  policy  compliant  


50%  affordable  housing  contribution  are  required  to  submit  a  detailed  viability  

 
 
 
assessment  and  will  be  subject  to  early  and  late  review  mechanisms  to  ensure  


that  affordable  housing  contributions  are  increased  if  viability  improves  over  

 


time.  If  the  late  stage  viability  review  indicates  that  the  development  is  capable  
  

 
 
of  delivering  more  affordable  housing  than  originally  stated,  payment  in  lieu  


contributions  will  be  required.  Further  guidance  on  the  early  and  late  stage  


review   is   provided   in   the   GLA's  Affordable   Housing   and   Viability   SPG.   
  
 
 
7.7 Approximately  47%  of  all  new  homes  delivered  in  Hackney  over  the  last  decade  

 


have  been  on  small  sites  with  developments  of  less  than  10  units.  These  are  


developments  where  the  Council  has  been  unable  to  secure  the  delivery  of  


affordable  housing.  Small  schemes  may  also  be  subject  to  affordable  housing  


review  mechanisms.  Further  guidance  will  be  set  out  in  the  Hackney  Housing  


SPD   and   Planning   Contributions   (S106)   SPD.   
  
 
 
7.8 In  order  to  better  meet  our  housing  needs  these  sites  will  be  required  to  


contribute  towards  affordable  housing  delivery  either  through  on-site  provision  


or  off-set  monetary  contributions  which  could  then  fund  Council-led  projects  to  


deliver   genuinely   affordable   housing.   
  
 
 
7.9 To  further  maximise  the  delivery  of  genuinely  affordable  housing  we  need  to  


make  sure  that  the  type  of  housing  delivered  on  larger  sites  of  10  units  or  more,  


is  affordable  to  Hackney  residents  having  regard  to  average  house  prices,  


private  rents  and  incomes  in  different  parts  of  Hackney. This  means  that  


different  affordable  housing tenure products will  be  appropriate  for  different  


areas.  In  certain  areas,  particularly  in  the  southern  wards  of  Hoxton  East  


Shoreditch,  Hoxton  West  and  Haggerston,  the  focus  will  be  on  delivering  Social 


Rented  alongside  Living  Rent. The  Future  Shoreditch  AAP  and  planning  briefs  


will  provide  further  policy  and  guidance  to  ensure the  delivery  of  genuinely  


affordable  housing on  key  sites  having  regard  to other  considerations  set  out  in  


this  policy.  We  will  also  encourage  the  development  of  innovative  intermediate  


housing  tenures  that  can  be  made  affordable  to  a  wider  range  of  groups  in  

 


Hackney.  
 

## Lp14  Dwelling  Size  Mix


A. Developments  should  provide  the  following  mix  of  dwelling  sizes  for  

social/London   affordable   rent   tenures: 

Bedrooms   /   
  
1   Bed  
 
2   Beds

dwelling   mix   -   
  
bed  
 
bed  
 
market  
 

 
B. The  Council  will  seek  a  higher  proportion  of  4+  bed  dwellings  in  the  

 


Stamford  Hill  AAP  area  across  all  tenures.  The  Stamford  Hill  AAP  will  


provide   further   guidance   on   this. C.The  Council  will  consider  variations  to  the  dwelling  size  mix  sought  if  

 
this  can  be  justified  based  on  the  tenures  and  type  of  housing  


proposed,  site  location,  area's  characteristics,  design  constraints,  


scheme  viability;  and  where  shared  ownership  is  proposed,  the  ability 

 


of   potential   occupiers   to   afford   the   homes   proposed.   
  
7.10 There  is  a  diverse  population  in  Hackney,  with  an  equally  diverse  range  of  


housing  needs  and  requirements;  this  means  ensuring  that  a  good  selection  of  

 


housing  types  and  tenures  are  built.  The  Council  recognises  that  there  is  a  need  

  
 
for  all  types  of  dwelling  sizes  and  tenures.  However,  priorities  are  set  based  on  


3
what  local  housing  needs  assessments  and  the  Council's  housing  waiting  list  


identifies  the  highest  quantum  of  each  type  of  housing  required  to  meet  housing  


needs   in   the   Borough.   This   is   reflected   in   the   policy   requirements.  


7.11 The  ability  to  deliver  this  mix  may  vary  depending  on  site  location  and  


characteristics,  and  scheme  viability  and  this  will  be  assessed  by  the  Council  


where  proposals  differ  from  the  required  mix.  In  some  circumstances,  proposals  


involving  the  provision  of  affordable  family  housing  (in  this  case  units  with  3  

 
bedrooms  or  more)  in  excess  of  the  policy  requirements  will  be  supported  to  


enable  borough-wide  housing  targets  to  be  met.  In  other  circumstances,  it  may  

 
 
be  necessary  to  provide  a  lower  proportion  of  family-sized  private  units  within  a  

 

 
scheme  if  this  can  be  demonstrated  to  deliver  a  greater  proportion  of  genuinely  
  

 


affordable  units  on  site.  The  Council  will  also  allow  flexibility  in  estate  


regeneration  schemes,  in  particular  where  a  unit  mix  has  been  agreed  on  the  

 


basis  of  detailed  consultation  with  the  residents  taking  on-board  the  specific  


needs  of  returning  residents.  There  will  also  be  flexibility  on  the  requirement  for  


family   units   for   proposals   for   retirement,   sheltered   or   extra   care   housing.   
  

## Lp15  Build  To  Rent

 
 
A. Standalone  Build  to  Rent  developments  or  Build  to  Rent  blocks  on  a  

 
larger  mixed  tenure  development  will  be  supported  provided  they 


comply  with  all  other  plan  policies  and  they  meet  all  of  the  following 


criteria:  
 
i. The  homes  are  held  as  Build  to  Rent  under  a  covenant  for  at  least  

 


15   years;   and  
 
ii. All   units   are   self-contained   and   let   separately;   and  
 
iii. The  development  is  in  unified  ownership  and  unified  management;  


and  
 
iv. The   development   has   professional   and   on-site   management;   and  
 
v. Longer  tenancies  of  three  years  or  more  are  offered  with  defined  


in-tenancy   rent   reviews.  


B. At  least  50%  of  the  units  delivered  in  Build  to  Rent  schemes  must  be  


affordable  housing,  subject  to  viability.  The  tenure  of  the  affordable  


housing  delivered  as  part  of  the  development  will  be  required  to  be  


London   Living   Rent.  


C. S106  agreements  on  Build  to  Rent  schemes  will  include  a  'clawback'  

 
 
mechanism  in  the  event  of  units  being  sold  out  of  the  Build  to  Rent  


sector.  Further  guidance  will  be  provided  in  the  Hackney  Housing  


SPD.   
  


7.12 The  growth  of  the  Private  Rented  Sector  (PRS)  and  a  decline  in  the  realistic  

 


chances  for  home  ownership  for  many  people  in  Hackney  in  the  short  to  


medium  term  due  to  rising  house  prices  means  that  'Build  to  Rent'  schemes,  


supported  by  the  Mayor  of  London  in  the  Housing  SPG  are  increasingly  


relevant,  particularly  in  terms  of  the  affordable  housing  products  that  can  be  


secured   as   part   of   such   schemes   (i.e.   Living   Rent   and   London   Affordable   Rent).  
 

 
 
7.13 The  Council  recognises  the  increasing  importance  of  the  PRS  in  meeting  


housing  needs  in  the  Borough,  and  supports  the  provision  of  'build-to-rent  


private  rented  homes',  where  these  are  well-designed,  where  evidence  is  


provided  that  high  standards  of  management  will  be  put  in  place,  and  where  the  

 


benefits  of  such  housing  are  balanced  against  the  level  of  affordable  housing  


provision.  The  Council  will  work  with  the  GLA  and  other  delivery  partners  to  


seek  to  increase  and  improve  the  private  rented  sector  in  line  with  the  London  


Plan   and   the   Mayor's  Housing   SPG.  


7.14 For  Build  to  Rent  schemes  and  where  a  certain  number  of  homes  are  offered  for  

 


rent  in  new  developments,  of  the  affordable  housing  sought,  the  Council  will  


require  London  Living  Rent  and  London  Affordable  Rent  rather  than  Discounted  


Market  Rent  or  Affordable  Private  Rent  to  ensure  homes  are  'genuinely  


affordable'.  
 

## Lp16  Self/Custom-Build  Housing

 
 
A. Proposals  for  self/custom  build  housing  projects  to  meet  demand  will  


be   supported   provided   they   are   compliant   with   all   other   plan   policies.   
  
 
B. Large  developments  of  0.25ha  or  more  should  seek  to  make  


provisions  for  serviced  plots  of  land  for  self/custom  build  housing,  


subject   to   the   characteristics   and   constraints   of   the   site   and   area.  


C. Self/custom-build  development  will  be  supported  and  encouraged  on  


infill  development  sites  provided  the  scheme  is  in  accordance  with  all  

 


other   development   plan   policies. 
 
7.15 The  Self-Build  and  Custom  Housebuilding  Act  2015  and  Self-Build  and  Custom  


Housebuilding  (Register)  Regulation  2016  require  the  Council  to  keep  a  register  

 
 
of  individuals  and  associations  of  individuals  who  are  interested  in  self-build  and  

 
 
 
custom  housebuilding  and  are  seeking  to  acquire  serviced  plots  of  land  within  


the  Council.  The  Register  serves  as  an  indication  of  demand  for  


self/custom-build  in  the  Borough.  The  Act  also  places  a  duty  on  councils  and  

 


other  public  bodies  to  have  regard  to  the  self-build  and  custom  housebuilding  


register  when  carrying  out  their  planning,  housing,  land  disposal  and  


regeneration   functions.   
  

## Lp17  Housing  Design

A. The  Council  will  expect  all  homes  and  extensions  to  existing  properties  


to  be  of  high  quality  design  and  meet  the  internal  and  external  space  


and  accessibility  standards  set  out  in  the  London  Plan,  GLA  Housing  


SPG   and   Hackney's  Housing   SPD. B. Housing  types  must  be  designed  to  be  flexible  in  use  and  adaptable  


over   time   to   meet   the   changing   housing   needs   in   Hackney. C. Schemes  will  be  required  to  meet  the  sustainable  design  and  


construction  standards  set  out  in  the  Hackney's  Sustainability  and  the  


Built   Environment   SPD,   as   a   minimum. D. Residential  extensions  and  alterations  schemes  should  have  regard  to  


the  Residential  Extensions  and  Alterations  SPD  (and  any  future  


updates   to   this   SPD).   
  


7.16 Through  the  London  Plan  the  GLA  has  set  minimum  housing  design  and  


accessibility  standards  as  well  as  standards  for  the  provision  of  private  amenity  


space  for  new  homes  in  all  London  Boroughs.  This  together  with  the  


requirements  identified  in  Building  Regulations,  access  to  outdoor  amenity  


space  and  ensuring  that  new  buildings  are  well-insulated  and  sufficiently  


ventilated  to  avoid  the  health  problems  associated  with  damp,  heat  and  cold,  will  


help   provide   healthier   living   environments   for   Hackney   residents.   
  
 
 
7.17 The  Council  will  be  publishing  an  update  to  the  2009  Residential  Extensions  and  


Alterations   SPD   which   will   replace   the   current   guidance.  
 

## Lp18  Housing  Older  And  Vulnerable  People

 
 
A. Proposals  for  the  development  of  housing  aimed  at  meeting  the  

specific  needs  of  older  people  and  vulnerable  people  will  be  supported  

provided   all   of   the   following   criteria   are   met:  
 
i. There  is  a  demonstrable  need  for  the  type  of  accommodation  


proposed   within   the   Borough;   and  
 
ii. Schemes  are  located  in  accessible  areas  where  the  daily  needs  of  


older  people  in  terms  of  convenience  shopping,  community  facilities  


and   public   transport   can   be   met;   and  
 
iii. Schemes  are  designed  to  a  high  standard,  meeting  any  relevant  


guidance   for   the   form  of   accommodation   proposed;   and   
  
iv. Schemes  will  be  required  to  demonstrate  that  the  proposed 


accommodation  has  considered  the  needs  of  the  intended  occupiers  


and  that  the  type  of  facilities  proposed,  the  level  of  independence  


promoted  and  the  amount  of  provision  of  support  and/or  care  


proposed   is   appropriate   for   the   intended   occupiers.   
  
 
 
B. All  new  general-purpose  homes  must  be  designed  to  be  adaptable  to  


meet  the  needs  of  disabled  people  and  the  elderly  as  well  as  assisting  


independent   living   at   home.  


C. Proposals  for  specialist  housing  for  older  people  will  be  required  to  


provide  50%  affordable  housing  with  the  tenure  split  outlined  in  the  


table  below.  Alternative  affordable  tenures  will  be  considered  where  it  

 
is  demonstrated  that  the  accommodation  proposed  is  affordable  to  


older   people   in   the   Borough   and   suitable   to   their   needs.  
 

|            | Intermediate     |     |        |     |
|------------|------------------|-----|--------|-----|
| Affordable |                  |     |        |     |
| Rent       |                  |     |        |     |
| Specialist | 30-40%           |     | 60-70% |     |
| Housing    |                  |     |        |     |

 
D. The  Council  will  have  regard  to  viability,  site  context  and  surroundings;  


the  character  of  the  development;  and  design  constraints  where  the  


applicant   is   unable   to   meet   affordable   housing   requirements.  


E. Proposals  for  the  loss  of  existing  accommodation  for  older  and  


vulnerable  people  will  be  resisted  unless  one  of  the  following  criteria  


apply:  
 
i. It  can  be  suitably  demonstrated  that  the  needs  met  by  this  form  of  


accommodation  can  be  met  or  re-provided  elsewhere  in  the  


Borough;   or  
 
ii. Adequate  replacement  accommodation  to  meet  the  needs  of  older  or  


vulnerable  people  is  provided,  subject  to  satisfying  other  plan  


policies;   or  
 
iii. It  can  be  demonstrated  that  there  is  no  longer  an  identified  need  for  

 


the  existing  accommodation  due  to  there  being  a  surplus  of  this  type  

 


of   accommodation   in   the   Borough.  
 
7.18 Population  forecasts  suggest  that  there  will  be  a  significant  increase  in  the  


population  of  older  people  in  Hackney,  and  London  more  generally  including  a  

 
rise  in  the  population  of  over  65's  and  an  even  larger  rise  in  the  over  85's  during  

 


the  plan  period.  The  Council  will  endeavour  to  support  older  people  to  live  


independently  in  their  own  homes  for  as  long  as  possible  and  will  therefore  seek  


to  ensure  in  the  first  instance  that  new  homes  are  designed  to  be  accessible  to 


people  with  mobility  difficulties.  Whilst  this  is  preferable  there  will  still  be  an  


increasing  need  to  house  elderly  people  in  specialist  accommodation.  


4
Hackney's  local  housing  needs  assessment  estimates  a  significant  need  for  

 


additional  units  of  specialist  accommodation  for  older  people  of  different  types  


up  to  2025.  The  GLA  Strategic  Housing  Market  Assessment  (SHMA)  indicates  


that  up  to  2025  there  will  be  a  need  to  provide  3,600-4,200  additional  specialist  

 


units  per  annum  across  London.  To  meet  this  need  the  London  Plan  allocates 


an  indicative  annual  strategic  benchmark  for  London  boroughs  to  inform  local  

targets  over  this  period.  For  Hackney  the  benchmark  is  to  deliver  55  specialist  

 


units  for  older  people  per  annum  with  a  tenure  split  of  25  units  for  private  sale,  

 


10  for  intermediate  sale  and  20  for  London  affordable  rent.  This  would  equate  to  


825  additional  specialist  units  over  the  plan  period  if  the  target  is  rolled  forward.  

 
 
  
 
 
An  emerging  needs  assessment  and  Hackney's  Older  Persons  Housing  


Strategy   will   provide   clearer   data   on   the   need   for   specialist   provision.  


7.19 As  well  as  older  people  with  support  needs,  there  are  a  number  of  other  people  

 


in  the  Borough  that  are  considered  to  be  vulnerable  and  in  need  of  some  form  of  

 


specialist  or  conventional  housing.  The  local  housing  needs  assessment  


identifies  likely  future  needs  for  vulnerable  people  up  to  2021  and  includes  


people  suffering  from  mental  health  problems,  rough  sleepers,  people  with  


learning  disabilities  and  those  with  issues  regarding  alcohol  misuse  among  


others.  The  Council  already  works  to  help  vulnerable  people  through  health  and  


social  care  professionals,  and  not  all  vulnerable  people  will  require  additional  


accommodation  however  the  Council  will  support  proposals  to  accommodate  


needs.   
  

## Lp19  Residential  Conversions

|                                                                                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|
| A. The  conversion  of  houses  to  flats  will  be  supported  if  all  of  the |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |
| following   criteria   are   met:                                                |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |
| i. adequate   access   would   be   provided   to   each   dwelling;   and       |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |
| ii. each   dwelling   would   be   self-contained;   and                         |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |

iii. the  distinctive  character  of  the  building/area  would  not  be  adversely  


affected   by   development   with   particular   regard   to   heritage   assets. B. A  minimum  of  one  family  unit  of  3  or  more  bedrooms  at  ground  floor  is  

 

 
provided.  A  minimum  of  one  4+  bed  family  unit  will  be  required  as  part  
  


of   conversion   schemes   in   the   Stamford   Hill   AAP   area.  


7.20 The  increase  in  the  number  of  smaller  households,  combined  with  rising  house  


prices,  has  increased  the  demand  for  smaller  dwellings  in  the  Borough,  


particularly  from  single  people  and  young  couples  on  modest  incomes.  One  way  


the  supply  of  smaller  dwellings  has  been  delivered  has  been  through  the  


conversion  of  larger  homes  to  flats. 
 Although  the  contribution  made  by  


conversions  of  larger  houses  to  smaller  dwellings  is  useful  in  providing  a  lower  

 

 
 
cost  accommodation,  conversions  to  flats  can  result  in  the  loss  of  family  


housing,   and   inflate   the   price   of   remaining   larger   homes.   
  
 
 
7.21 The  aim  of  this  policy  is  to  maximise  housing  delivery  whilst  ensuring  that  a  mix  

 

 
 
of  housing  is  provided  by  ensuring  that  the  conversion  of  larger  houses  provides  
 
  


at  least  one  3  bedroom  dwelling  with  access  to  private  amenity  space  and  larger  

 


units  in  the  Stamford  Hill  area  where  there  is  evidence  of  need  for  larger  family  

 


size   homes.  


7.22 The  Council  recognises  that  a  different  dwelling  mix  may  be  required  to  enable  

 


development  or  as  part  of  the  refurbishment  of  a  recognised  heritage  asset  

 


building  in  order  to  retain  distinctive  townscape  character,  and  the  historic  layout  


of   a   property.   As   such,   flexibility   will   be   applied   in   such   instances.   
  
 
 
7.23 More  detailed  policy  requirements  and  information  about  the  size  of  units  


required   in   the   Stamford   Hill   area   will   be   set   out   in   the   Stamford   Hill   AAP.   
  

## Lp20  Student  Housing

A. Proposals  for  new  student  accommodation  will  be  permitted  if  all  of  the  

 


following   criteria   are   met:  
 
i. The  site  is  not  suitable  for  development  for  conventional  self  


contained   units;   and   
  
ii. The  accommodation  is  needed  and  secured  for  students  from  one  or  
 
  


more   academic   institutions   based   in   Hackney,   or   within   London;   and  
 
iii. The   proposal   does   not   result   in   the   loss   of   conventional   housing;   and  
 
iv. The  site  is  highly  accessible  by  public  transport  and  provides  good  


access   to   local   shops,   services   and   facilities;   and  
 
v. The  development  does  not  lead  to  an  over-concentration  of  such  


uses  which  may  be  detrimental  to  local  amenity,  or  the  balance  of  


uses  within  the  area  affecting  the  character  and  function  of  an  area;  


and  
 
vi. 10%  of  rooms  provided  are  wheelchair  accessible  or  easily  


adaptable   for   occupation   by   wheelchair   users;   and  
 
vii. A  minimum  of  50%  of  student  rooms  will  be  required  to  be  affordable  


for  students,  subject  to  viability,  in  the  context  of  student  


maintenance   loans   and   rents;   and   
  
viii. The  rent  for  affordable  student  rooms  should  be  set  at  a  maximum  of  

 
 
 
55%  of  the  maximum  income  that  a  new  full-time  student  studying  in  

 

 
London  and  living  away  from  home  could  receive  from  the  


Government's  maintenance  loan  for  living  costs  for  that  academic  


year. B. Details  of  the  management  of  such  developments  must  be  submitted  


with  an  application,  setting  out  how  the  impact  of  development  on  local  


amenity   will   be   minimised.   
  


7.24 The  neighbouring  boroughs  of  Newham,  Islington,  Tower  Hamlets  and  the  City  


of  London  contain  several  well-known  London  universities  which  are  easily  


accessible  from  the  Borough.  Student  numbers  have  been  increasing  in  recent  


years  with  the  highest  ever  admission  of  places  recorded  during  2015.  Whilst  


the  Council  acknowledges  that  inadequate  local  provision  would  result  in  


students  having  to  travel  long  distances  to  attend  university,  putting  pressure  on  


the  public  transport  infrastructure,  and  that  students  contribute  socially  and  


economically  to  an  area,  it  nonetheless  recognises  that  the  development  of  

 


new-build  student  housing  must  not  be  to  the  detriment  of  other  key  uses  such  


as  general  housing  delivery,  other  housing  for  which  there  is  a  demonstrable  

 
 
need  or  designated  employment  land  or  lead  to  an  over-concentration  of  similar  


uses  which  may  be  detrimental  to  residential  amenities  or  the  balance  of  land  


uses,  affecting  the  character  and  function  of  an  area.  Proposals  for  student 


accommodation  will  therefore  only  be  approved  where  a  demonstrable  need  

 
 
 
exists  and  where  accommodation  is  secured  for  occupation  by  members  of  one  

 


or   more   specified   higher   education   institutions.  
  
 
 
7.25 The  Council  has  approved  a  significant  number  of  student  bed  spaces  in  the  last  

 

 
 
 
decade,  the  majority  of  which  have  been  approved  in  designated  employment  


areas.  Although  having  become  more  mixed  use  in  nature,  Shoreditch  is  


predominantly  a  commercial  area,  including  and  adjacent  to  the  City  Fringe  and  
  


the  CAZ,  and  containing  large  areas  of  designated  employment  land.  As  such  


any  further  consents  for  large  student  housing  developments,  particularly  within  


designated  employment  areas,  are  likely  to  affect  the  character  and  function  of  


the  area.  In  addition  to  pressure  on  other  important  land  uses,  such  


developments  can  have  adverse  impacts  on  amenity,  such  as  through  noise 


levels  and  additional  vehicular  traffic  particularly  at  the  start  and  end  of  terms,  


and  increased  pressure  on  local  services,  including  demand  for  evening  


economy  uses  (which  the  Council  seeks  to  manage  in  Shoreditch,  for  example).  

 


In  considering  a  proposal  for  student  accommodation,  the  Council  will  take  into  
 
  


account  the  likely  impact  on  the  amenities  of  surrounding  locality,  and  the  


cumulative  impact  on  the  locality  and  community  where  a  number  of  such  uses  

 


already  exist,  to  ensure  an  appropriate  balance  of  land  uses  in  an  area,  and  to  

avoid  detrimental  effects  on  amenity.  Applicants  should  submit  details  of  how  


student   housing   developments   will   be   managed   to   minimise   impacts   on   amenity.   
  

 
 
7.26 In  addition  to  this,  reflecting  the  overwhelming  need  for  self-contained  genuinely  


affordable  homes  and  workspace,  applicants  will  need  to  demonstrate  that  the  


site  has  been  considered  for  C3  residential  development  before  student  housing  


uses   can   be   accepted.   
  
 
 
7.27 Student  housing  should  serve  academic  institutions  based  in  Hackney,  or  within  

 


London.  The  specific  academic  institution(s)  that  the  student  housing  


development  would  serve  should  be  specified  when  a  planning  application  is  

 


submitted.  Student  housing  will  be  secured  by  planning  agreement  or  condition  


relating  to  the  use  of  the  land  or  its  occupation  by  members  of  specified  higher  


educational   institutions.   
  
 
 
7.28 Providers  should  seek  to  deliver  student  accommodation  that  is  affordable  for  


students   in   the   context   of   student   maintenance   loans   and   rents.  

## Lp21  Large  Scale  Purpose-Built  Shared  Housing

A. Development  involving  the  provision  of  new  large-scale  purpose-built  


shared  housing  comprising  at  least  50  units  will  only  be  permitted  if  all  

 
 
of   the   following   criteria   are   met:  
 
i. It  meets  an  identified  need;  and  the  site  is  not  suitable  for  


development   for   conventional   self-contained   units.  
 
ii. It  is  located  in  an  area  well-connected  to  local  services  and  facilities, 
  


and   in   an   area   with   high-transport   accessibility;   and  
 
iii. It   is   under   single   management;   and  
 
iv. its  units  are  all  for  rent  with  minimum  tenancy  lengths  of  no  less  than  


three   months;   and  
 
v. a   management   plan   is   provided   with   the   application;   and  
 
vi. At  least  50%  of  all  units  are  provided  at  rental  levels  which  do  not  


exceed  one-third  of  ward-level  incomes  (excluding  utility  bills  and  


Council   Tax)   subject   to   viability   and   site   context;   and  
 
vii. Rooms  and  communal  spaces  are  of  a  high  quality  and  of  adequate  

 


size 
 and 
 the 
 development 
 provides 
 a 
 good 
 standard  of  


accommodation  in  terms  of  space  standards,  management  


requirements,  facilities,  daylight  and  sunlight,  aspect  and  amenity  


space;   and  
 
viii. Suitable  communal  amenity  space  is  provided  to  meet  the  needs  of  

 


occupiers;   and  
 
ix. The  development  must  not  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the  amenity  

 


of   neighbouring   occupiers;   and   
  
x. The  development  must  not  lead  to  an  over-concentration  of  these  


types   of   uses   in   the   area;   and  
 
xi. 10%  of  the  units  provided  are  easily  adaptable  for  occupation  by  


wheelchair   users.  
 
xii. A  detailed  management  plan  and  details  of  proposed  tenancy  


lengths   are   provided. 
 
 
7.29 Shared  housing  as  identified  above  is  a  strategically  important  part  of  London's  

  


housing  offer,  meeting  distinct  needs  and  reducing  pressure  on  other  elements  


of  the  housing  stock.  They  provide  flexible  and  relatively  affordable  


accommodation  through  the  private  rented  sector.  They  also  play  an  important  


role  in  providing  labour  market  flexibility  in  London.  Shared  housing  can  


therefore  form  an  important  part  of  Hackney's  housing  stock  provided  they  are  


designed   well   and   of   a   good   quality.   
  
 
 
7.30 Whilst  it  is  recognised  that  shared  accommodation  is  an  increasingly  valuable  
  


form  of  accommodation  in  the  Borough,  C3  residential  is  still  the  priority  land  


use  in  the  Borough  and  type  of  accommodation  for  which  there  is  the  greatest  

 
 
 
need.  Shared  housing  proposals  will  usually  be  resisted  on  sites  allocated  for  


residential  development  and  sites  already  with  planning  permission  for  


residential   development.   
  

 
 
7.31 The  Council's  preference  is  for  the  provision  of  on-site  affordable  housing  


through  the  provision  of  units  at  one-third  of  ward  level  incomes.  The  level  and  


quality  of  provision  of  on-site  affordable  housing  will  be  one  of  the  


considerations  when  assessing  whether  the  site  is  suitable  for  purpose-built  


shared  housing.  Proposed  shared  housing  development  will  be  subject  to  a  

 
planning  agreement  to  ensure  rents  for  rooms  remain  affordable  for  low-income  


occupiers  in  the  long  term.  In  accordance  with  Policy  LP13  off-site  affordable  


housing  or  payments  in-lieu  will  be  considered  in  truly  exceptional  


circumstances  where  the  Council  is  satisfied  that  the  off-site  provision  would  


secure   a   better   outcome   in   meeting   housing   needs.  
 

## Lp22  Houses  In  Multiple  Occupation  (Hmo)

A. Proposals   for   new   HMOs   will   be   supported   if  they:  
 

i. Do  not  result  in  the  loss  of  existing  housing  suitable  for  family  


occupation;   
  
ii. Are  well  served  by  local  shops  and  facilities;  and  are  accessible  by  


public   transport;   
  
iii. Will  not  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the  amenity  of  neighbouring  

 


occupiers;  
 
iv. Can  demonstrate  that  proposed  rent  levels  would  be  suitable  for  


people   with   low   incomes;   
  
v. Provide  rooms  and  communal  spaces  of  a  high  quality  and  of  


adequate  size  and  the  development  provides  a  good  standard  of  

 


accommodation  in  accordance  with  Council  requirements  in  terms  of  

 
 
 
space  standards,  management  requirements,  facilities,  refuse  


arrangements,  daylight  and  sunlight,  aspect  and  amenity  space  (the  


Council's  "Guidance  for  Houses  and  Flats  in  Multiple  Occupation"  


should   be   used   as   a   benchmark).  


B. Evidence  of  management  arrangements  and  details  of  proposed  


length  of  tenancy  agreements  should  be  provided  where  the  proposal  


would   consist   of   non   self-contained   rooms   for   7   (or   more)   occupants.  


C. Loss  of  any  good  quality  HMO  properties  will  be  resisted  unless  


adequate 
 replacement 
 facilities 
 are 
 provided 
 or  it  can  be  


demonstrated   that   the   existing   facility   is   no   longer   required.  
 
●
HMOs  defined  as  C4  by  the  Use  Classes  Order  -  Small  shared  houses  

 


occupied  by  between  three  and  six  unrelated  individuals,  as  their  only  or  


main   residence,   who   share   basic   amenities   such   as   a   kitchen   or   bathroom.   
  
●
Larger  HMOs  classed  as  Sui  Generis  by  the  Use  Classes  Order  -  

 
Shared  houses  occupied  by  more  than  six  unrelated  individuals,  as  their  


only  or  main  residence,  who  share  basic  amenities  such  as  a  kitchen  or  

 
 
 
bathroom.  


7.32 As  with  purpose-built  shared  housing,  HMOs  can  form  an  important  part  of  


Hackney's  housing   stock   provided   they   are   designed   well   and   of   a   good   quality.   
  
 
 
7.33 Proposed  shared  housing  development  will  be  subject  to  a  planning  agreement  

 
 
 
to  ensure  rents  for  rooms  remain  affordable  for  low-income  occupiers  in  the  


long-term.  Granting  of  a  HMO  license  will  be  subject  to  meeting  the  Council's  

 


Private   Sector   Housing   Unit   requirements.  
 

## Lp23  Gypsy  And  Traveller  Accommodation

A. Proposals  for  new  sites  and  pitches  to  meet  the  needs  of  Gypsies,  


Travellers  and  Travelling  Showpersons  will  be  supported  provided  that  


all   of   the   following   criteria   are   met:  
 
i. there  is  a  demonstrable  need  supported  by  the  Council's  needs  


assessment;   and  
  
ii. the  site  is  suitable  for  residential  development  and  has  good  access  
 
  


to   services   and   facilities   to   meet   the   needs   of   residents;   and  
 
iii. development  on  the  site  does  not  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the  

 


natural   environment;   and  
 
iv. development  on  the  site  does  not  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the  

 


amenity   of   neighbouring   and   nearby   residents   and   businesses;   and  
 
v. development   is   respectful   of   and   sensitive   to   the   local   character;   and  
 
vi. the   site   is   easily   accessible   from  the   public   highway;   and  
 
vii. the   site   is   not   vulnerable   to   flood   risk.  


B. Proposals  for  the  loss  of  existing  travellers  sites  and  pitches  will  be  


resisted  unless  an  equivalent  number  of  replacement  pitches  are  


provided.   
  


7.34 Based  on  the  2018  Hackney  Gypsy  and  Traveller  Accommodation  Assessment  


there  is  a  need  for  8  pitches  and  a  further  84  pitches  units  for  non-travelling  
 
  
 
  
 
  


gypsy   and   travellers   within   the   Borough   to   2033.  


7.35 Hackney  Council  is  working  jointly  with  the  LLDC  and  other  agencies  to  deliver  
 
  


the  Bartrip  Street ,  E9  site,  to  meet  the  needs  arising  within  the  first  five  years  of  


the  plan  period.  The  Bartrip  Street  site,  lies  within  the  London  Borough  of  


Hackney  within  an  area  for  which  the  LLDC  currently  have  planning  powers.  


The  site  is  allocated  as  a  `land  with  potential  for  gypsy  and  travel  site'  in  the  

 


LLDC   adopted   Local   Plan   (July   2015).  


7.36 The  Council  will  seek  to  accommodate  the  housing  needs  of  the  non-travelling  


community  through  dedicated  pitches  and  other  housing  policies  in  this  Plan.  As  

 


part  of  the  Council's  duty  to  meet  the  housing  needs  of  the  community,  people  


can   also   apply   for   accommodation   through   the   Council's   housing   register.  


7.37 Proposals  for  new  sites  and  pitches  will  be  assessed  against  the  relevant  


criteria  of  Policy  LP1  `Design  and  Quality  and  Local  Character'  and  LP2  


`Amenity'.  
 

## Lp24  Preventing  The  Loss  Of  Housing

A. The  redevelopment,  conversion  or  change  of  use  of  land  or  buildings  


involving  loss  of  residential  floorspace  will  be  resisted  and  will  only  be  


permitted   where   at   least   one   of   the   following   conditions   are   met:  
 
i. The  land  or  buildings  are  no  longer  suitable  for  residential  use  and  it  

 
is  considered  inappropriate  to  re-provide  residential  accommodation;  


or  
 
ii. Replacement  housing  of  an  appropriate  type  is  being  provided  at  


either  an  equivalent  or  higher  density,  or  to  address  a  specialist  


housing  need  for  which  there  is  a  particular  shortage  in  the  Borough;  

  
 
  
 
 
or  
 
iii. Redevelopment  is  necessary  to  create  better  quality  homes  and  


dwelling  mix,  and  improve  the  living  environment,  as  part  of  major  


regeneration   schemes;   or  
 
iv. A  proposal  seeks  to  combine  small  dwellings  to  create  larger  


dwellings   in   the   Stamford   Hill   AAP   area;   or  
 
v. The  proposal  will  enable  sub-standard  units  to  be  enlarged  to  meet  


residential   space   standards;   or  
 
vi. The  proposal  is  for  an  essential  community  use  or  infrastructure  for  


which  there  is  demonstrable  need,  and  it  can  only  be  provided  by  the  
 
  

 


loss   of   existing   residential   floorspace;   or  


B. Where  a  loss  of  affordable  housing  is  proposed,  a  like-for-like  


replacement   in   terms  of   tenure   and   number   of   units   will   be   required.  
 
7.38 The  Council  seeks  to  increase  overall  housing  stock  in  the  Borough  and  


therefore  in  conjunction  with  supporting  the  provision  of  new  dwellings,  the  


Council  will  resist  the  loss  of  existing  residential  uses.  There  may  however  be 


circumstances  where  a  loss  of  housing  may  be  acceptable  and  the  policy  sets  
 
  


out   circumstances   under   which   a   loss   of   housing   will   be   considered.  


7.39 Additionally,  there  may  be  locations  where  a  current  residential  use  is  


incompatible  with  the  surrounding  area,  for  example  due  to  noise  or  access  


issues,  or  the  particular  circumstances  of  listed  buildings  and  disused  


accommodation  over  shops  may  also  merit  changes  of  use  from  housing  to  


ensure  improvement  and  reuse  of  dilapidated  buildings.  In  other  circumstances,  


and  subject  to  compliance  with  all  applicable  policies,  the  loss  of  a  residential  

 
 
unit  to  enable  the  provision  of  a  community  facility  such  as  a  school  or  health  

 

 


facility  may  constitute  an  acceptable  change  of  use,  if  suitable  alternative  sites  

 


are  not  available  and  the  community  facility  can  only  be  provided  by  use  of  a  

 
residential  building,  and  there  is  demonstrable  demand  for  the  non-residential  


use.  Some  proposals  for  changes  of  residential  uses  to  supported  housing  may  


also   be   acceptable.  


7.40 Where  the  loss  of  affordable  housing  is  proposed  on  a  particular  site  which  is  a  

 
 
  

  
part  of  a  wider  redevelopment  programme,  such  as  the  Council's  Estate  


Regeneration  Programme,  like-for-like  replacement  affordable  housing  can  be  


re-provided   across   the   whole   programme   rather   than   at   each   particular   site.  
 

## Lp25  Visitor  Accommodation

A. The  amount  of  new  visitor  accommodation  including  short-term  lettings  


will  be  managed  having  regard  to  up-to-date  assessments  of  current  


and  future  room  demand  and  supply  published  by  the  Council.  Where  


the  assessment  indicates  long-term  demand  has  not  yet  been  met,  


visitor  accommodation  applications  will  be  permitted  if  it  meets  the  

  
 
 
following   criteria:  


B. Large  scale  hotels  (50+  rooms)  will  be  permitted  in  the  CAZ  and  major  

 


town  centres  where  there  is  an  identified  need  that  the  Council  deems  

 


to  be  greater  than  identified  need  for  other  policy  compliant  land  uses.  


Small  scale  hotels  in  other  areas  may  be  permitted  if  they  meet  


specific   identified   needs.  


C. Proposals  for  any  new  visitor  accommodation  including  short-term  


lettings  will  be  permitted  if  all  of  the  following  criteria  are  met.  The  

 


development   must:  
 
i. not  result  in  a  total  supply  (which  includes  approved  schemes  not  yet  
 
   


built)  of  visitor  accommodation  rooms  significantly  greater  than  the  


projected   demand   for   rooms;   and  
 
ii. not  lead  to  an  over-concentration  of  similar  uses  within  the  locality;  


and  
 
iii. not  result  in  the  loss  of  general  purpose  housing  or  opportunities  to  


provide  conventional  C3  housing  or  employment  uses  in  line  with  


Policies  LP12  Housing  Supply  and  LP26  New  Employment  


Floorspace;   and   
  
iv. complement  the  balance  and  mix  of  uses  in  the  area,  and  the  


character  and  function  of  the  area,  and  is  compatible  with  


surrounding   land   uses;   and   
  
v. not  cause  an  unacceptable  level  of  disturbance  to,  or  loss  of  amenity  


to,   occupiers   of   surrounding   premises;   and  
 
vi. make  adequate  provision  for  servicing,  and  pick  up  and  set  down  


points   for   taxis   and   coaches;   and  
 
vii. includes   at   least   10%   wheelchair   accessible   bedrooms.  


D. Active  frontages  should  be  incorporated  at  ground  floor  level  and  


ancillary  facilities  such  as  conference  rooms,  restaurants  or  


gymnasiums  should  be  accessible  to  the  public,  unless  there  are  valid  


and  appropriate  reasons  why  such  facilities  should  not  be  accessible  


to   the   public.  


7.41 The  most  recent  projections  of  demand  and  supply  of  visitor  accommodation  in  

 
5
London  up  to  2050  show  that  Hackney,  in  a  range  of  scenarios,  is  progressing  

 

 
 
towards  meeting  its  projected  demand  when  taking  account  of  rooms  already  in  

 
the  planning  pipeline.  Short-term  lettings  are  also  growing  and  a  2015  study  by  

 


Colliers  International  shows  that  Hackney  is  one  of  the  top  five  London  


boroughs  for  Airbnb  overnight  stays  with  over  150,000  overnight  stays  a  year.  

 
 
Whilst  the  Council  intends  to  meet  demand  for  visitor  accommodation  in  the  


Borough,  the  Council  will  seek  to  balance  this  with  the  need  to  provide  


genuinely  affordable  housing  and  other  essential  land  uses.  Applications  for  


new  visitor  accommodation  will  therefore  be  assessed  on  a  needs  basis,  which  

 


will  be  closely  monitored,  as  well  as  the  other  criteria  listed  in  the  policy.  


Applications  for  short-term  lettings  will  also  be  assessed  against  this  policy  


where  the  letting  period  exceeds  90  days  in  any  one  calendar  year,  as  per  the  


2015   Deregulation   Act.  


7.42 The  priority  residential  land  use  within  town  centres  is  for  C3  housing.  In  the  


case  that  the  demand  for  visitor  accommodation  within  the  Borough  has  been  


met,  the  Council  would  seek  the  provision  of  B1a  and  other  town  centre  uses  


within   the   CAZ  and   town   centres.  
  
  
 
strong and Competitive Economy Which Benefits All 
8 
 

## 8. A   Strong   And   Competitive   Economy Which   Benefits   All

 
 
8.1 Hackney  has  a  thriving  economy  with  increasing  employment  rates  and  a  


diverse  employment  sector.  In  response  to  Hackney's  evidence  on  employment  


needs,  the  Borough's  designations  have  been  redefined  to  comprise  of  Priority  


Office  Areas  (POAs),  Priority  Industrial  Areas  (PIAs)  and  Locally  Significant  


Industrial  Sites  (LSIS).  These  areas  represent  Hackney's  core  reservoir  of  


employment  land.  They  are  extremely  tightly  drawn  clusters  covering  only  


approximately  6%  of  Hackney's  total  land  mass  meaning  it's  vital  they  are  


protected.  


8.2 A  large  part  of  Hackney's  southern  boundary  is  within  the  Central  Activities  


Zone  (CAZ).  The  importance  of  the  CAZ  and  enlarged  City  Fringe  Opportunity  


Area  Planning  Framework  (OAPF)  boundary  (designated  in  the  London  Plan)  


has  been  recognised  by  the  Government;  with  these  areas  granted  exemption  


from  the  permitted  development  rights  for  office  to  residential,  between  May  


2013  and  May  2019  and  an  Article  4  was  confirmed  in  April  2019  to  continue  to  

 
 
  


protect   valuable   employment   land   in   this   area.   
  

## Key  Facts:

●
In  2016,  there  were  around  142,000  jobs  in  Hackney  resulting  in  a  jobs  

 
 
density   of   0.72   (as   a   ratio   of   total   jobs   to   working   age   population).  
 
●
In  2017,  there  were  approximately  18,995  active  enterprises  in  Hackney.  


Of  these  enterprises  91.3%  are  micro  sized  enterprises  (0-9  employees),  


7.4%  are  small  (10  to  49  employees),  1.0%  are  medium  (50  to  249  


employees)   and   0.2%   are   large   (250+   employees)   enterprises   (NOMIS).  
 
●
The  total  supply  of  employment  floorspace  in  the  Borough  is  933,696sqm.  

 
 
This  comprises  of  573,705sqm  of  office,  134,563sqm  light  industrial  and  


225,428sqm   of   industrial   floorspace.   
  

## Chapter  Objective:

●
To  support  a  diverse  and  mixed  economy  providing  at  least  23,000  new  
 
  


jobs  across  a  range  of  sectors  by  2033  and  maximise  the  supply  of  


affordable   workspace   and   low   cost   industrial   space.  

## Lp26  Employment  Land  And  Floorspace

A. The  Council  will  plan  to  deliver  a  minimum  of  118,000sqm  of  new  


office  floorspace  by  2033.  New  employment  floorspace  (B  class)  in  the  

 
 
Borough  will  be  permitted  in  Locally  Significant  Industrial  Sites  


(LSISs),  Priority  Office  Areas  (POAs),  Priority  Industrial  Areas  (PIAs),  


Central   Activities   Zone   (CAZ),   and   designated   town   centres.   
  
 
 
B. New  development  in  the  designated  employment  areas  should  


maximise  employment  floorspace  in  line  with  Policy  LP27  Protecting  


and  Promoting  Office  floorspace  in  the  Borough  and  Policy  LP28  


Protecting  and  Promoting  Industrial  land  and  floorspace  in  the  


Borough  and  should  incorporate  other  priority  uses  such  as  


conventional  affordable  housing  and  have  active  frontages  at  ground  


floor   level,   where   appropriate.  


C. New  employment  space  outside  of  the  locations  outlined  in  A  will  be  

 
 
 
permitted   where:  
 
i.  it  can  be  demonstrated  that  there  is  a  reasonable  prospect  of  it  

 
being   occupied;   and  
 
ii. the  employment  use  is  small-scale  and  would  contribute  towards  


place-making;   or  
 
iii. the  employment  space  is  being  provided  as  part  of  a  temporary  use;  

 

 
 
 
and  
 
iv. does   not   have   an   unacceptable   impact   on   residential   amenity.  


D. Within  POAs,  office-led  (B1a  Use  Class)  development  will  be  


supported.   These   areas   comprise   of:  
 
●
Dalston  
 
●
Mare   Street  
 
●
Kingsland  
 
●
Shoreditch  
 
●
Wenlock  


E. Within  PIAs,  industrial  uses  will  be  supported.  These  areas  comprise  


of:  
 
●
Anton   Street  
 
●
Belfast   Road  
 
●
De   Beauvoir  
 
●
Hackney   Downs  
 
●
Homerton  
 
●
Red   Square  
 
●
Shacklewell  
 
●
Theydon   Road  
 
●
Prout   Road  
 
●
Tilia   Road  


F. Within  the  following  LSISs,  industrial  development  will  be  permitted.  


Other   uses,   other   than   ancillary   development,   will   be   resisted.   
  
●
Millfields   
  
●
Helmsley   Place  
 
●
Frederick   Terrace  


G. Where  appropriate,  new  employment  floorspace  (all  B  use  classes)  


should  be  fitted  out  to  a  standard  that  enables  the  immediate  


occupation  by  businesses,  including  basic  mechanical  and  electrical  


services,  fire  detection  and  protection  services  and  internal  surface  


finishes.   
  


8.3 Historically,  policy  has  allowed  the  market  to  influence  what  type  of  B  use  class  

 
 
 
floorspace  is  delivered  within  new  development.  Over  time  this  has  meant  a  

 
gradual  decline  in  industrial  land/floorspace  within  Hackney's  designated 


employment  areas,  particularly  in  the  south  and  mid-Hackney,  and  the  


replacement  of  this  floorspace  with  higher  value  office  floorspace  within  new  


development.   
  
 
 
8.4 In  order  to  help  retain  vital  industrial  land  and  floorspace  within  Hackney  and  


ensure  that  sufficient  office  floorspace  is  delivered  to  meet  Hackney's  economic  

 


needs,   the   LP33   policy   approach   now   differentiates   between   POAs   and   PIAs.   
  
 
 
8.5 Hackney's  employment  evidence  suggests  a  strong  need  for  B1a  office  (a  


minimum  of  117,000sqm  up  to  2033).  This  policy  directs  offices  to  the  most  


sustainable  locations;  within  the  designated  POAs  and  throughout  the  Borough  


within  existing  town  centres.  These  areas  are  considered  to  be  the  most  viable  


and  sustainable  locations  for  employment  development.  The  Plan  will  seek  a  

 
higher  proportion  of  employment  floorspace  (+60%)  and  affordable  workspace  


within  the  Dalston,  Wenlock  and  Shoreditch  POAs  as  part  of  new  


employment-led  development,  subject  to  viability.  The  Plan  will  adopt  a  rigorous  

 
 
approach  to  industrial  land  management,  protecting,  re-providing  and  


intensifying  industrial  land  and  floorspace  within  designated  PIAs.  Development  


should  be  mixed  use  where  possible  in  both  POAs  and  PIAs  and  incorporating  


other   priority   uses   such   as   housing.  


8.6 New  employment  opportunities  outside  of  designated  employment  areas  will  


only  be  permitted  if  the  applicant  can  demonstrate  a  reasonable  prospect  of  

 

 


occupancy  through  the  submission  of  marketing  evidence  in  accordance  with  


Appendix  1  and  can  demonstrate  that  it  will  contribute  towards  place-making,  for  
  

 


example  by  enhancing  the  public  realm  or  amenity,  repurposing  underused  or  


misused  space,  designing  out  crime  or  incorporating  an  element  of  community  


use   or   providing   social   value.  


8.7 New  employment  floorspace  (all  B  use  classes)  should,  where  possible,  be  


fitted  out  to  a  standard  that  enables  the  immediate  occupation  by  businesses,  

 


including  basic  mechanical  and  electrical  services,  fire  detection  and  protection  


services  and  internal  surface  finishes,  where  appropriate.  This  will  support  


meantime  use  of  employment  floorspace  by  businesses  and  social  enterprises  


which  would  aid  in  the  activation  of  such  space  pending  the  permanent  


occupation   by   end   users.

## Lp27  Protecting  And  Promoting  Office  Floorspace  In  The Borough New   Office   Floorspace

A. New  development  involving  the  provision  of  new  office  (B1a)  


floorspace  must  comprise  well  designed,  high  quality  buildings  and  


floorspace  that  is  flexible  /  adaptable  to  accommodate  a  range  of  unit  
 
  
  


sizes  and  types  with  good  natural  light,  suitable  for  sub-division  and  


configuration  for  new  uses  and  activities,  including  for  occupation  by  


small   or   independent   commercial   enterprises.  

B. All  applications  incorporating  new  office  floorspace  should  include  a  

 
marketing  strategy  which  demonstrates  the  design  and  layout  of  the  


proposed  floorspace  is  of  a  high  quality,  is  flexible  and  meets  the  


needs   of   likely   end   users.  
 

## Priority   Office   Areas   (Poas)

C. New  development  within  designated  POAs  will  be  permitted  where  it  is  

  
employment-led  and  where  B1  use  class  is  the  primary  use  in  line  with  

 

 
 
 
the   below   thresholds,   subject   to   viability.  
 
i. Within  the  Future  Shoreditch  AAP  (Shoreditch  POA  and  part  of  the  


Wenlock  POA)  -  at  least  60%  of  the  floorspace  across  the  area  as  a  
 
  

 
whole   is   B1   employment   floorspace.  
 
ii. In  the  Dalston  POA  and  remainder  of  the  Wenlock  POA  -  at  least  

 
 
 
60%   of   the   overall   new   floorspace   on   a   site   is   B1   use   class   
  
iii. In  remaining  POAs  -  at  least  50%  of  the  overall  new  floorspace  on  a  

 

 
site   is   B1   use   class.  


D. Retail,  hotel,  community,  leisure,  residential  development  in  POAs  will  


be   permitted    where   all   of   the   following   criteria   are   met:  
 
i. The  development  forms  part  of  an  employment-led,  mixed-use  


scheme  including  conversion  schemes  meeting  the  thresholds  


identified   in   Ci.   and   ii.   above.  
 
ii. Proposals  must  be  appropriate  to  the  characteristics  and  functioning  


of  the  site  and  will  not  compromise  the  on-going  operations  of  


businesses   in   the   POA.  
 
iii. Proposals  must  satisfy  the  requirements  of  Policies  including;  other

Infrastructure),  Policy  LP25  (Visitor  Accommodation)  Policy  LP32  


(Town  Centres),  and  Policy  LP38  (Evening  and  Night  Time  


Economy).   
  

iv. Residential   uses   are   not   provided   at   ground   floor   level.  


E. The  change  of  use  of  ground  floor  commercial  uses  to  residential  use  


will   not   be   permitted.  


F. Proposals   solely   for   residential   use   will   not   be   permitted   in   POAs.  


G. Existing  industrial  uses  and  low  cost  employment  floorspace  in  POAs  


must  be  re-provided  in  line  with  Policy  LP29  Affordable  workspace  and  

 


Low   Cost   Employment   Floorspace.  

## Retention   Of   Office   Floorspace

H. Development  involving  the  net  loss  of  B1a  office  floorspace  in  the  


POAs   will   not   be   permitted.  


I.
Development  involving  the  net  loss  of  B1  office  floorspace  outside  of  


POAs   will   only   be   permitted   where   all   of   the   following   criteria   are   met:  
 
i. Robust  marketing  evidence  (refer  to  Appendix  1)  is  submitted  which  

 
 
 
demonstrates  that  there  has  been  no  demand  for  the  existing  or  


vacant  land  and  floorspace  for  its  current  or  former  use,  and  the  


possibility  of  retaining,  reusing  or  redeveloping  it  for  similar  or  


alternative  smaller  or  more  flexible  units  for  employment  generating  


use,  or  other  alternative  employment  generating  use  has  been  fully  


explored;  
ii. Any  new  employment  use  provides  a  range  of  higher  quality,  more  

 


flexible  floorspace  and  preferably  a  higher  density  employment  than  

 


the   previous;   and  
 
iii. It  is  demonstrated  that  the  new  commercial  floorspace  being  


provided  has  a  strong  likelihood  of  being  occupied  through  the  


submission   of   a   detailed   marketing   strategy   (refer   to   Appendix   1).  


8.8 Policy  LP27  directs  new  office  developments  to  the  most  sustainable  locations;  


including  the  POAs  and  designated  Town  Centres.  New  development  within  


POAs  must  be  employment-led  and  must  provide  the  maximum  economically  


feasible  amount  of  employment  land  and  floorspace  for  the  site,  subject  to  


viability.  Employment  floorspace  should  be  provided  in  line  with  the  targets  in  


part  C  of  the  policy.  The  approach  within  the  Future  Shoreditch  AAP  is  to  


achieve  60%  B1  employment  floorspace  across  the  relevant  POA  as  a  whole  

 
 
(Shoreditch  POA  and  part  of  the  Wenlock  POA);  further  guidance  will  be  


provided  within  the  AAP.  The  approach  in  POAs  outside  of  the  Shoreditch  AAP  


is  to  achieve  the  target  B1  employment  floorspace  outlined  in  Part  C  of  the  


policy  on  a  site-by-site  basis.  Where  there  is  an  existing  B  use  class  on  the  site  
 
  

 
 
  


other  than  B1a  (such  as  B1b,  B1c,  B2  or  B8),  re-provision  of  the  existing  B  use  

 
 
class  should  contribute  towards  the  employment  floorspace  targets  set  out  in  

part  C  above  and  should  be  re-provided  as  low-cost  employment  floorspace  in  


line  with  Policy  LP29  Affordable  Workspace  and  Low  Cost  Employment  


Floorspace.  The  remainder  of  the  employment  floorspace  in  the  employment-led  

 
 
 
scheme  must  be  B1  floorspace.  100%  residential  schemes  will  not  be  permitted  


in   POAs.  


8.9 Other  uses  (retail,  hotel,  community,  leisure,  residential)  are  acceptable  as  part  


of  a  mixed-use  scheme  within  a  POA  if  they  function  in  a  'supporting  capacity'  
  

 
  

 
 
 
for  redevelopment  to  assist  with  the  viability  and  quality  of  the  replacement  


employment   floorspace   and   are   in   compliance   with   other   policies   in   this   Plan.   
  
 
 
8.10 New  business  floorspace  needs  to  be  designed  to  respond  to  changing  


economic  conditions  and  support  economic  growth.  Unless  it  is  demonstrated  

 
 
 
that  a  commercial  occupier  is  lined  up  for  employment  land/floorspace  and  has  
  
 
  


particular  requirements  from  the  premises  or  land  being  developed,  proposals  


should  incorporate  flexible  design  features  to  provide  future  adaptability  for  a  

 
range  of  uses  and  occupants,  such  as  small  and  medium  sized  companies  and  


'startup'  businesses.  Premises  should  have  good  natural  lighting  (and  avoid  


basement  and  windowless  offices).  All  applications  incorporating  new  business  


floorspace  should  be  accompanied  by  a  marketing  strategy  in  accordance  with  

 


Appendix   1   demonstrating   how   these   parameters   have   been   met.   
  
 
 
8.11 Development  proposing  a  net  loss  of  office  floorspace  within  POAs  will  not  be  
 
  


supported.  Where  a  scheme  proposes  the  net  loss  of  office  floorspace  outside  
 
  


of  POAs,  clear  and  robust  marketing  evidence  must  be  submitted  in  accordance  

 
 
with  Appendix  1  to  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  demand  for  use  of  land  or  


floorspace  as  it  exists,  or  alternatively  for  employment  purposes  if  reconfigured  
 
  

 
 
into  smaller  units,  or  for  alternative  employment  generating  use.  Alternative 


employment  generating  uses  will  generally  include  non-B  class  uses  which  have  


similar  operational  requirements  and  generate  comparable  employment  density.  


It  must  also  be  demonstrated  that  these  uses  will  not  impact  on  the  function  of  


nearby  B  class  use  and  that  they  are  appropriate  in  amenity  terms  where  part  of  
  

 


mixed-use   development.  
 

## Lp28  Protecting  And  Promoting  Industrial  Land  And Floorspace  In  The  Borough New   Industrial   Floorspace

A. Where  proposals  involve  the  provision  of  new  industrial  floorspace  


(B1c,  B2,  B8  and  Sui  Generis  uses  of  an  industrial  nature),  the  


development  must  be  of  an  appropriate  scale  and  should  be  flexible  


and  adaptable  for  different  types  of  uses  and  suitable  to  meet  future  


needs.   
  

## Priority   Industrial   Areas   (Pias)

B. New  development  or  redevelopment  of  sites  within  PIAs  will  be  


permitted   where:  
 
i. It  maximises  the  delivery  of  employment  floorspace  by  maintaining,  


re-providing  the  same  quantum  of  industrial  floorspace  (as  either  


B1c,   B2,   B8),   or   intensifying   the   existing   industrial   uses;   
  
ii. It  includes  the  maximum  viable  amount  of  employment  floorspace  


(refer   to   Appendix   1);   and  
 
iii. in  the  case  of  mixed  use  development  schemes,  are  designed  to  


ensure  that  there  are  no  environmental  impacts  or  conflicts  between  


uses,   applying   the   agent   of   change   principle.  

## Locally   Significant   Industrial   Sites   (Lsis)

C. Within  LSISs,  development  involving  non-industrial  uses  will  not  be  


permitted.   
  

## Retention  Of  Industrial  Floorspace  Outside  Of  Priority  Industrial Areas   And   Locally   Significant   Industrial   Sites

D.  The  loss  of  industrial  land  and  floorspace  outside  of  Priority  Industrial  


Areas  and  Locally  Significant  Industrial  Sites  will  be  permitted  where  


all   of   the   following   criteria   are   met;  
 
i. Robust  marketing  evidence  (refer  to  Appendix  1)  is  submitted  which  

 
 
 
demonstrates  that  there  has  been  no  demand  for  the  existing  or  


vacant  land  and  floorspace  for  its  current  or  former  use,  and  the  


possibility  of  retaining,  reusing  or  redeveloping  it  for  similar  or  


alternative  smaller  or  more  flexible  units  for  employment  generating  


use,  or  other  alternative  employment  generating  use  has  been  fully  


explored;   and  
 
ii. Any  new  employment  use  provides  a  range  of  higher  quality,  more  

 


flexible  floorspace  and  preferably  a  higher  density  employment  than  

 


the   previous   use;   and  
 
iii. It  is  demonstrated  that  the  new  commercial  floorspace  being  


provided  has  a  strong  likelihood  of  being  occupied  through  the  


submission   of   a   detailed   marketing   strategy   (refer   to   Appendix   1).  


8.12 There  is  increasing  pressure  on  Hackney's  industrial  land.  Rents  are  increasing,  
  


supply  is  reducing  and  businesses  are  being  pushed  further  out.  The  findings  of  
  


the  Hackney  Employment  Land  Study  stress  the  need  to  ensure  the  retention  of 


an  adequate  stock  of  industrial  capacity  to  support  a  diverse,  adaptable  and  

 


more   sustainable   economy.   
  
 
 
8.13 In  order  to  help  protect  vital  industrial  land  and  floorspace  to  meet  Hackney's  


economic  needs,  Policy  LP28  supports  the  protection  of  industrial  land  and  


floorspace  and  encourages  proposals  for  new  industrial  floorspace  in  the  


Borough,   in   designated   PIAs.   
  
 
 
8.14 Any  new  development  within  PIAs  will  need  to  maintain  or  re-provide  the  same  


quantum  or  intensify  existing  industrial  uses  (B1c,  B2,  B8).  Where  a  proposal  

 
 
within  a  PIA  involves  redevelopment  of  non-industrial  uses,  new  development  
  


should  be  mixed  use  providing  the  maximum  economically  feasible  amount  of  B  

 
Class  employment  floorspace.  100%  residential  schemes  will  not  be  permitted  


in  PIAs.  Guidance  on  how  industrial  areas  can  be  used  more  intensively,  and  


how  industry  can  be  integrated  in  residential  areas  is  detailed  in  the  Mayor  of  


6
London's  Industrial   Intensification   Primer.  


8.15 Where  a  scheme  proposes  a  loss  of  industrial  land  and  floorspace  outside  of  
  
 
  


PIAs  and  LSISs,  robust  marketing  evidence  must  be  provided  in  accordance  


with   Appendix   1   to   show   that   there   is   no   demand   for   this   floorspace.  

## Lp29  Affordable  Workspace  And  Low  Cost  Employment Floorspace

A. New  major  employment  and  mixed  used  development  in  the  


Borough's  designated  employment  areas,  the  CAZ  and  town  centres  


should  provide  affordable  or  low  cost  workspace,  equating  to  a  


minimum   of   10%   of   gross   new   employment   floorspace.  
 

## Re-Provision   Of   Low   Cost   Employment   Floorspace

B. Major 
 employment 
 and 
 mixed 
 use 
 schemes 
 involving 
 the  


redevelopment  of  existing  low  cost  employment  floorspace  must  


re-provide  the  maximum  economically  feasible  amount  of  low  cost  


employment  floorspace  in  perpetuity  (refer  to  Appendix  1), 
 at  


equivalent  rents  and  service  charges,  suitable  for  the  existing  or  


equivalent  uses,  subject  to  current  lease  arrangements  and  the  desire  


of   existing   businesses   to   remain   on-site.   
  

## Affordable  Workspace

C. If  the  low  cost  employment  floorspace  equates  to  less  than  10%  of  


gross  new  employment  floorspace  or  there  is  no  low  cost  workspace  

 


to  be  re-provided  as  part  of  a  major  development  scheme,  new  


affordable   workspace   should   be   provided   as   follows:  
 
i. Development  in  the  Shoreditch  POA:  at  least  10%  (offset  by  the  


amount  of  low  cost  employment  floorspace  provided)  of  the  new  


employment  floorspace  (gross)  should  be  affordable  at  no  more  than  


40%   of   the   locality's  market   rent   in   perpetuity,   subject   to   viability.  
 
ii. In  remaining  POAs,  the  CAZ  and  town  centres:  at  least  10%  (offset  


by  the  amount  of  low  cost  employment  floorspace  provided)  of  the  


new  employment  floorspace  (gross)  should  be  affordable  at  no  more  


than  60%  of  the  locality's  market  rent  in  perpetuity,  subject  to  


viability.  


D. New  affordable  workspace  should  normally  be  provided  on-site.  Only  


in  exceptional  circumstances  where  it  can  be  demonstrated  robustly  

 


that  this  is  not  appropriate  in  terms  of  the  policies  in  this  Plan,  it  may  

 
 
be  provided  off-site.  A  cash-in-lieu  contribution  will  only  be  accepted  

 


where  this  would  have  demonstrable  benefits  in  furthering  affordable  


workspace   in   the   Borough   and   other   policies   in   this   Plan.  


E. In  circumstances  where  it  is  viable,  both  low  cost  employment  


floorspace   and   new   affordable   workspace   should   be   provided.  


F. Where  additional  floorspace  is  proposed  through  amended  planning  


applications  (i.e.  through  re-submissions  or  variations  of  existing  


planning  applications  or  submission  of  a  new  planning  application  for  

 


an  extension  resulting  in  an  increase  in  existing  employment  


floorspace)  within  four  years  of  the  commencement  of  the  original  


planning  permission  and  the  total  amount  of  new  employment  


floorspace  exceeds  1000  sqm,  affordable  or  low  cost  workspace  will  


be   sought   in   line   with   A   and   B   above.  

 
 
8.16 There  is  a  need  for  the  provision  of  affordable  and  low  cost  floorspace  within  the  
   


Borough  to  support  the  needs  of  start-ups,  SMEs  and  cultural  and  creative  


enterprises  such  as  artists'  studios  and  designer-maker  spaces,  as  well  as  


charities  and  social  enterprises.  Policy  LP29  sets  out  that  the  Council  will  seek  


either  the  inclusion  of  a  proportion  of  affordable  workspace,  or  the  reprovision  of  

 


low  cost  floorspace,  within  major  commercial  development  schemes,  and  within  


major  mixed-use  schemes  in  the  Borough's  designated  employment  areas,  the  


CAZ  and  town  centres.  This  policy  is  triggered  in  schemes  that  provide  over  


1000sqm  of  gross  employment  floorspace.  Within  a  mixed-use  scheme,  


affordable  or  low  cost  workspace  would  only  be  required  if  the  scheme  


incorporates   over   1000sqm   of   gross   employment   floorspace.  


8.17 Low  cost  workspace  is  employment  floorspace  which  may  be  secondary  or  


tertiary  in  nature,  of  a  lower  quality  or  specification,  with  cheaper  rents  or  


leases,  often  providing  space  for  start-ups,  creative  or  light  industrial  occupiers  


such  as  artists  or  makers'  spaces.  Any  major  proposal  in  the  designated  


employment  areas,  the  CAZ  and  town  centres  which  involves  the  


redevelopment  of  existing  low  cost  floorspace  must  re-provide  the  maximum  


economically  feasible  quantity  of  low  cost  floorspace  as  part  of  the  scheme.  This  


low  cost  floorspace  should  be  provided  within  an  equivalent  B  use  class  in  


perpetuity  at  genuinely  affordable  rents  having  regard  to  Part  C  of  this  policy.  


Existing   occupants   should   be   re-housed   within   the   development   where   possible.  


8.18 Affordable  workspace  is  new-build  employment  floorspace,  providing  affordable  
 
  


space  for  small  businesses,  predominantly  within  the  B1  use  class,  to  occupy,  


often  operated  and  managed  by  a  workspace  provider.  Where  there  is  no  low  

 


cost  floorspace  to  be  re-provided  as  part  of  a  major  scheme,  new  build 


affordable  workspace  should  be  provided  in  line  with  criteria  B.  This  space  


should  be  secured  through  legal  agreement  with  a  Council-registered  


workspace   provider.   Affordable   workspace   will   be   provided   in   perpetuity.  
 

## Lp30  Railway  Arches

A. Proposals   for   the   use   of   railway   arches   for   B1c,   B2,   B8,   and   other   
similar   industrial   sui   generis   uses   will   be   permitted:  


B. Proposals  for  B1c,  B2  and  B8  uses  alongside  ancillary  uses  will  be  


permitted  where  the  ancillary  use  would  help  sustain  and  complement  


the  primary  use  of  the  railway  arch  for  industrial  purposes  and  there  is  

 
intensification   of   the   remaining   industrial   floorspace.   
  
 
 
C. Proposals  for  commercial  or  community  uses  such  as  those  falling  


within  B1a,  A  and  D  use  class  in  locations  outside  of  Locally  


Significant  Industrial  Sites  will  be  permitted  if  all  of  the  following  criteria  

 


are   met.   The   proposed   development:  
 

i.  complements  and  helps  sustain  the  primary  use  of  the  parade  of  


arches   for   employment   purposes;  
 
ii.  maintains  or  re-provides  the  same  quantum  of  industrial  floorspace  


or   intensifies   the   existing   industrial   floorspace;  
 

iii.  does  not  impact  on  the  function  of  existing  businesses  within  the  


parade   of   arches;   and  
 
iv.   incorporates   an   active   frontage   
  
 
 
D. Proposals  involving  the  loss  of  industrial  floorspace  will  only  be  


permitted  where  it  can  be  demonstrated  through  robust  marketing  


evidence  (see  Appendix  1)  that  there  is  no  demand  for  industrial  use  


or  industrial  with  ancillary  uses  detailed  in  part  B  of  this  policy.  


Proposals  for  major  development  involving  the  loss  of  low  cost  


employment 
 floorspace 
 should 
 re-provide 
 this 
 floorspace 
 in  


accordance   with   Policy   LP29   Part   B.   
  
 
  
  
8.19 Hackney  contains  a  number  of  railway  arches  with  adjacent  land.  Railway  


arches  and  adjacent  land,  both  within  and  outside  of  designated  employment  


areas,  provide  good  sites  for  the  location  of  some  of  the  'heavier'  type  


industries,  within  B2  and  B8  uses,  which  they  have  traditionally  been  used  for.  


These  are  important  employment-generators  and  businesses  for  local  people,  


and  assist  in  serving  both  Hackney's  and  London's  economy.  Space  within  


railway  arches  can  also  be  used  flexibly  and  innovatively  to  accommodate  a  

 
range  of  B1c  activities  e.g.  workshops  and  light  industrial  uses.  Many  of  them  


provide  low  cost  employment  floorspace  for  a  range  of  activities  which  play  an  

 


essential   role   in   the   functioning   of   the   local   economy.  


8.20 Policy  LP30  protects  and  supports  the  continued  use  of  railway  arches  for  


industrial  use.  Ancillary  uses  are  also  permitted  where  the  ancillary  use  would  


help  sustain  and  complement  the  primary  use  of  the  railway  arch  for  industrial  


purposes  (B1c,B2,B8  use  class)  and  there  is  intensification  of  the  remaining  


industrial  floorspace.  This  can  be  achieved  through  the  introduction  of  


7
mezzanines   or   making   more   efficient   use   of   floorspace/   yard   space  .   
  
 
 
8.21 Railway  arches  can  also  successfully  contribute  to  the  regeneration  and  visual  


improvement 
 of 
 town 
 centre 
 and 
 edge-of-centre 
 locations, 
 through  


accommodating  active  frontage  uses  and  accommodating  new  vibrant  uses.  


Other  commercial  and  community  uses  (such  as  B1a,  A  and  D  use  class)  may  

 
  


also  be  appropriate  outside  of  designated  Locally  Significant  Industrial  Sites  


where  they  satisfy  the  requirements  of  Part  C  of  the  policy.  Given  the  need  to  


retain  industrial  floorspace  in  the  Borough,  where  an  arch  contains  industrial  


land/floorspace or land/floorspace last used for industrial purposes,  


development  should  maintain  or  reprovide  the  same  quantum  of  industrial  


floorspace  or  intensify  the  industrial  use.  This  could  be  achieved  where  an  arch  


or  parade  of  arches  form  part  of  a  comprehensive  scheme  thereby  allowing  the  

 


existing  industrial  uses  to  be  re-provided  or  intensified  within  the  wider  scheme,  


or  by  intensifying  industrial  uses  within  an  arch/associated  yard  space  to  enable  

other  complementary  commercial  /  community  uses.  Any  new  community  or  

 


commercial  use  must  also  incorporate  an  active  frontage,  complement  and  help  


sustain  the  primary  use  of  the  parade  for  employment  purposes,  and  not  impact  


upon   the   function   of   existing   business   within   the   parade   of   arches.   
  
 
 
8.22 Proposals  involving  the  loss  of  industrial  floorspace  must  demonstrate  that  the  


loss  of  the  industrial  land/floorspace  is  acceptable  through  the  submission  of  


robust  marketing  evidence  in  accordance  with  Appendix  1.  The  marketing  


evidence  must  also  demonstrate  that  the  possibility  of  incorporating  an  ancillary  


use  that  would  help  complement  and  sustain  the  primary  use  of  the  arches  for  


industrial  purposes  has  been  fully  explored.  The  Council  will  use  Section  106  


agreements  to  ensure  that  loss  of  existing  low  cost  employment  floorspace  is  


re-provided  in  accordance  with  Policy  LP29  Part  B.  Uses  not  specified  in  Parts  


A,  B  and  C  of  Policy  LP30  are  considered  to  be  inappropriate  uses  within  


arches.   
  
 
 
8.23 Any  arches  falling  within  designated  employment  areas  would  also  need  to  


satisfy  relevant  policies  in  the  plan,  namely  Policies  LP26,  LP27  and  L28.  


Proposals  for  town  centre  uses  (e.g.  Classes  A1,  A3,  D2  uses)  must  also  meet  


the  requirements  for  the  sequential  approach  and  impact  assessment  for  such  


uses  proposed  outside  of  designated  retail  centres,  and  comply  with  other  


policies  in  this  Plan  such  as  Policies  LP1,  LP2,  LP26,  LP27  and  L28  where  


relevant.  
 

## Lp31  Local  Jobs,  Skills  And  Training

 
 
A. New  development  should  provide  a 
 broad  range  of  employment  


opportunities  across  a  variety  of  sectors  available  to  local  residents,  
 
  


including   in   both   the   construction   and   operation   of   new   developments.  


B. All   new   major   development   will   be   required   to:  
 
i. Where  appropriate,  contribute towards  employment  skills  and  


training  programmes  through  S106  legal  agreements  to  equip  


residents   with   the   skills   required to   gain   employment; and   
 
ii. Demonstrate 
 how 
 the 
 new 
 development 
 offers employment  


opportunities   to   residents.       


8.24 Promoting  economic  and  social  inclusion  in  Hackney  is  a  major  priority  for  the  

 


Council;  we  are  committed  to  ensuring  that  residents  seeking  work  have  the  


right  skills and  opportunities to  gain  employment.  The  construction  phase  of  new  


development  provides  opportunities  for  local  employment,  apprenticeships  and  


work  experience  placements  and,  once  constructed,  new  commercial  


developments  also  bring  employment  opportunities  for  local  residents.  In  order  


to  ensure  that  local  residents  can  secure  local  jobs,  we  will  seek  to  address  any  


skills  mismatch  between  the  Borough's  employers  and  the  local  community  by  


seeking  contributions  towards  local  employment  training  programmes  with  the  


aim  of  providing  residents  with  the  skills  needed  to  fill  jobs  both  locally  and  


further  afield,  thereby  increasing  employment  opportunities  for  Hackney's  


residents. Schemes  are  required  to  produce  an  Employment  and  Skills  Plan  to  


demonstrate  how  employment  and  training  requirements  will  be  addressed  and  


supported.  Further   information   is   set   out   in the Planning   Contributions   SPD.  
 

## 9 Planning For Vibrant Town Centres 9. Planning   For   Vibrant   Town   Centres

 
 
9.1 Town  centre  policies  seek  to  encourage  a  variety  of  retail,  commercial,  leisure  

 


and  cultural  facilities  within  the  designated  centres.  Hackney's  town  centres  


operate  as  a  network  and  perform  different  roles  and  functions  -  larger  town  
 
  

 
 
 
centres  provide  more  shops  for  durable  comparison  goods  with  smaller  centres  


meeting  the  day  to  day  needs  of  neighbourhoods.  Town  centres  will  remain  the  


main  shopping  channel,  however  the  growth  of  e-tailing  (online  shopping)  and  


m-tailing  (shopping  through  mobile  phones,  tablets  etc.)  means  that  for  centres  


to  remain  viable  they  must  provide  an  attractive  shopping  and  leisure  


experience  to  increase  the  amount  of  time  people  spend  on  the  high  street.  


Many  town  centres  are  also  historic  areas;  new  development  should  ensure  that  


it  conserves   the   historic   environment   and   is   of   good   design.  


9.2 The  Council  has  removed,  through  Article  4  Directions ,  the  permitted  


development  right  which  allows  flexible  changes  of  use  between  various  town  


centre  uses  from  A1,  A2,  A3,  A4,  A5,  B1,  D1  and  D2  uses  to  A1,  A2,  A3  and  B1  


uses,  as  well  as  the  permitted  development  right  for  the  change  of  use  of  shops  


(A1)  and  financial  services  (A2)  of  under  150sqm  to  residential  units  in  all  


designated  centres.  This  is  to  ensure  proper  planning  within  town  centres,  


allowing  the  Council  to  manage  the  balance  of  land  uses  within  the  designated  


centres  and  assess  the  impact  of  any  change  of  use  on  the  health  of  the  town  


centre   and   the   local   character   of   the   area.  

## Key  Facts:

●
There  is  a  need  for  16,600-19,500sqm  comparison  goods  floorspace  by  
 
  


2033.  
 
●
There  is  a  need  for  10,000-11,200sqm  convenience  goods  floorspace  by 
 
  


2033.  
 
●
The  click  and  collect  market  is  the  largest  online  growth  sector  in  the  UK  at  

 

 


the  current  time,  with  expenditure  expected  to  grow  by  64%  between  2016  


and   2021.   
  
●
As  of  August  2017,  58%  of  ground  floor  units  within  Hackney  Central  


primary  shopping  frontage  and  57%  of  Dalston  primary  frontage  are  in  A1  


use.  
 

## Chapter  Objectives:

●
To  support  distinctive  town  centres  and  a  vibrant  town  centre  experience.  

 


Evidence  indicates  that  there  will  be  a  requirement  of  approximately  


34,000sqm   of   new   retail   and   leisure   floorspace   by   2033.  
 

## Lp32  Town  Centres

A. The  Council  will  plan  to  deliver  34,000sqm  of  new  retail  and  leisure  


floorspace  by  2033.  New  retail  and  leisure  development  should  be  


located  within  the  following  designated  centres  (as  shown  on  the  


Policies  Map),  with  the  most  significant  growth  being  focused  primarily  


in  Dalston  and  Hackney  Central,  followed  by  Stamford  Hill  and  


Shoreditch:

B. Development  of  retail  (all  A  classes)  and/or  leisure  uses  over  200sqm  

 


outside  of  the  town  centres  listed  in  part  (A)  of  this  policy  (excluding  


the  CAZ)  will  not  be  permitted  unless  it  can  be  demonstrated  that  there  

 


is  no  suitable  premises  available  in  the  designated  centres  and  that  


there   would   be   no   harm   to   the   vitality   and   viability   of   these   centres.   
  


9.3 The  Borough  has  a  network  of  town  centres.  This  plan  classifies  these  to  


provide  a  hierarchy,  recognising  the  different  role,  size  and  draw  of  each  centre.  
  


Hackney's  town  centre  network  is  made  up  of  Dalston  and  Hackney  Central  -  

 


both  major  centres,  Stoke  Newington  and  Stamford  Hill  -  district  centres,  and  16  

 


designated  local  shopping  centres.  The  Borough  also  includes  part  of  the  


Finsbury   Park   district   centre.   
  
 
 
9.4 Hackney's  town  centres  will  be  the  focus  for  development  of  new  convenience  


and  comparison  retail,  as  well  as  accommodating  other  appropriate  town  centre  


8
uses  including  commercial,  community,  leisure,  culture,  tourism  and  civic  uses.  


Residential  uses  above  ground  floor  level  are  acceptable  within  a  town  centre.  

 
 
 
An  appropriate  mix  of  uses  and  services  is  needed  in  order  to  retain  and  further  

 
  


improve  the  vibrancy  and  vitality  of  the  town  centres.  New  developments  within  


the  town  centres  must  be  appropriate  to  the  scale,  character  and  function  of  the  


town  centre,  in  keeping  with  its  role  and  function  within  the  Borough's  town  


centre  hierarchy.  Development  will  be  expected  to  enhance  the  public  realm  in 


order   to   improve   accessibility,   social   spaces,   safety   and   the   environment.  


9.5 Proposals  for  development  of  new  or  extensions  to  town  centre  uses,  including  


all  A  Class  or  leisure  development,  which  are  outside  of  town  centres  and  in  


excess  of  200sqm  gross  internal  area  of  floorspace  must  comply  with  the  


sequential  test  and  impact  test  as  outlined  in  the  London  Plan.  Where  the  


sequential  test  demonstrates  that  the  development  cannot  be  located  within  a  

 
town  centre,  the  applicant  will  be  required  to  submit  a  retail  impact  assessment  

 


demonstrating  that  there  would  be  no  adverse  impact  on  the  vitality  and  viability  


of  the  designated  centres  as  a  whole.  The  Council  will  refuse  planning  


permission  where  there  is  evidence  that  proposals  are  likely  to  have  significant  

 


adverse   impacts   on   the   vitality   and   viability   of   the   designated   centres.  

## Lp33  Hackney  Central  And  Dalston

A. New  retail,  commercial,  leisure  and  cultural  development  will  be  


permitted  within  the  major  town  centres  of  Hackney  Central  and  


Dalston.  


B. Any  redevelopment  of  larger  A1  retail  units  over  1,000sqm  must  


re-provide   at   least   the   existing   quantum   of   A1   retail   floorspace.  

## Primary   Shopping   Areas   (Dalston)

C. Comprehensive  redevelopment  of  the  Kingsland  Shopping  Centre  


Primary  Shopping  Area  in  Dalston  must  re-provide  the  equivalent  or  


greater   quantum   of   A1   retail   floorspace.  

D. Change  of  use  away  from  A1  retail  will  be  resisted  in  the  Primary  


Shopping  Areas  of  Kingsland  Shopping  Centre  and  Ridley  Road  


Market  within  Dalston.  Any  change  of  use  must  meet  the  following  


criteria:  
 
i.
At  least  85%  of  the  units  within  each  Primary  Shopping  Area  must  


remain   in   A1   retail   use;   and  
 
ii. will  not  result  in  the  equivalent  of  a  group  of  two  or  more  adjoining  

 


standard   size   shop   units   being   in   non-retail   (A1)   uses;   and  
 
iii. must   incorporate   a   shop   front;   and  
 
iv. must  contribute  to  the  vitality  and  viability  of  the  Primary  Shopping  


Area.  


E. A  change  of  use  may  be  permitted  if  the  proportion  of  A1  falls  below  

 


85%  if  it  can  be  demonstrated  through  at  least  one  year's  marketing  
   


evidence  in  accordance  with  Appendix  1  that  there  is  no  realistic  


prospect   of   the   unit   being   used   for   A1   retail. Primary   Shopping   Frontages   (Dalston  and   Hackney   Central)  
 
F. A1  retail  uses  should  be  the  predominant  use  within  the  primary  


frontages,  constituting  at  least  60%  of  all  units  within  the  primary  


frontage  as  a  whole.  Development  involving  the  loss  of  A1  uses  will  
 
  


only  be  permitted  where  the  proposal  does  not  result  in  the  overall  

proportion  of  A1  falling  below  60%,  and  does  not  result  in  the  


equivalent  of  a  group  of  two  or  more  adjoining  standard  size  shop  


units   being   in   non-retail   (A1)   uses.   
  

G. A  change  of  use  may  be  permitted  if  the  proportion  of  A1  falls  below  

 


60%  if  it  can  be  demonstrated  through  at  least  one  year's  marketing  
   


evidence  in  accordance  with  Appendix  1  that  there  is  no  realistic  


prospect   of   the   unit   being   used   for   A1   retail.   
  

H. All  proposals  must  incorporate  a  shop  front  or  have  an  active  frontage  

 


and   contribute   to   the   vitality   and   viability   of   the   town   centre.  

## Secondary   Shopping   Area   (Dalston  And   Hackney   Central)

I.
A  diversity  of  A  class,  commercial,  leisure  and  cultural  facilities  will  be  

 


permitted     within   the   secondary   shopping   areas.  


J. The  change  of  use  from  retail  (A1)  will  only  be  permitted  where  the  


proposal   meets   all   of   the   following   criteria:  
 
i. The  proposal  will  not  result  in  the  equivalent  of  a  group  of  three  or  

 


more  adjoining  standard  size  shop  units  within  a  parade  being  in  

 


non-retail   (A1)   uses;   and   
  
ii. Individually  or  cumulatively  the  development  will  not  have  an  


adverse  effect  on  the  vitality  and  viability  of  the  centre  as  a  whole  

 
 
and/or   on   the   individual   shop   unit;   and  
 
iii. A   shop   front   and   active   frontage   is   retained   or   provided;   and  
 
iv. The  proposal  is  for  another  A-class,  commercial/office  or  community  
 
  


use.  


9.6 The  primary  shopping  areas  of  Kingsland  Shopping  Centre  and  Ridley  Road  


Market  within  Dalston  provide  key  concentrations  of  retail  floorspace.  In  order  to  


safeguard  these  areas  for  retail  purposes  any  redevelopment  must  not  result  in  

 
any   net   loss   of   retail   floorspace.  


9.7 A1  retail  should  be  the  principal  and  dominant  use  in  the  primary  frontages  


designated  in  Dalston  and  Hackney  Central  major  centres,  constituting  at  least  


60%  of  all  ground  floor  units  within  the  frontage.  The  remainder  of  the  units  in  


the  primary  frontage  should  be  supporting  A-class  town  centre  uses.  In  order  to  


ensure  shopping  centres  in  the  Borough  remain  healthy  and  vibrant,  if  the  

 
 
proposed  change  of  use  away  from  retail  would  result  in  the  total  proportion  of  


retail  units  in  the  primary  frontage  falling  below  the  60%  threshold  then  


marketing  evidence  will  be  required  to  show  that  there  is  no  demand  for  retail  in  

 

 
this   location.  


9.8 Outside  of  the  primary  shopping  areas  and  primary  shopping  frontages,  the  


remainder  of  the  major  town  centres  are  designated  as  secondary  shopping  


areas.  In  the  secondary  shopping  area,  a  diversity  of  uses  that  complement  the  

 


main  shopping  function  of  the  centre  will  be  permitted,  including  A  class,  B  


class,  D  class  and  other  commercial  uses  that  are  appropriate  within  a  town  

 
 
centre,  provided  the  proposal  meets  the  criteria  set  out  in  section  G  of  the  


policy.  Residential  uses  above  ground  floor  level  are  acceptable  within  town  


centres.  
 

## Lp34  Stoke  Newington,  Stamford  Hill  And  Finsbury  Park

A. New  retail,  commercial,  leisure  and  cultural  development  of  an  


appropriate  scale  will  be  permitted  within  the  district  town  centres  of  


Stoke   Newington,   Stamford   Hill   and   Finsbury   Park.  


B. A1  retail  should  be  the  predominant  use  within  district  centres,  


constituting  at  least  55%  of  all  units  within  the  district  centre  as  a  

 
whole.  Development  involving  the  loss  of  A1  uses  will  only  be  


permitted  where  the  proposal  does  not  result  in  the  overall  proportion  


of  A1  falling  below  55%  and  does  not  result  in  the  equivalent  of  a  

 
group  of  two  or  more  adjoining  standard  size  shop  units  within  an  


individual   parade   being   in   non-retail   (A1)   uses.  


C. A  change  of  use  may  be  permitted  if  the  proportion  of  A1  falls  below  

 


55%  if  it  can  be  demonstrated  through  at  least  one  year's  marketing  
   


evidence  in  accordance  with  Appendix  1  that  there  is  no  realistic  


prospect   of   the   unit   being   used   for   A1   retail.  


D. All  proposals  must  incorporate  a  shop  front,  have  an  active  frontage,  

 


contribute  to  the  vitality  and  viability  of  the  town  centre  or  parade,  and  


be   for   another   A-class,   commercial/office   or   community   use.  

E. Any  redevelopment  of  larger  units  over  1,000sqm  must  re-provide  at  


least   the   existing   quantum   of   retail/leisure/commercial   floorspace.  
 



9.9 Retail  uses  are  distributed  throughout  Hackney's  district  centres  so  distinct  


primary  and  secondary  frontages  have  not  been  designated  in  district  centres.  


These  centres  are  made  up  of  natural  parades  of  shops.  A1  retail  should  


constitute  at  least  55%  of  all  units  within  the  district  centre.  Any  proposed  


change  of  use  that  would  result  in  the  proportion  of  retail  units  in  the  district  


centre  falling  below  the  55%  threshold  is  required  to  provide  marketing  evidence  

 


to  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  demand  for  retail  in  this  location.  Any  change  of  

 


use   away   from  retail   must   also   meet   all   criteria   in   section   D   of   the   policy.   
  

 
 
9.10 Some  district  centres  contain  single  large,  anchor  retail  units  and  the  loss  of  any  


of  these  units  would  have  a  disproportionately  large  impact  on  vitality  and  


viability  of  the  district  centre.  Any  redevelopment  proposals  for  units  over  


1,000sqm  must  retain  the  existing  quantum  of  retail/leisure/commercial  


floorspace  in  a  configuration  that  will  enhance  the  vitality  of  the  town  centre  and  
 
  


contribute   to   place   making   and   public   realm   enhancement.

| A. A1  retail  should  constitute  at  least  50%  of  all  units  within  each  Local |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |
| Shopping   Centre.                                                                     |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |
|                                                                                        |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |
| B. A  change  of  use  may  be  permitted  if  the  proportion  of  A1  falls  below   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |

50%  if  it  can  be  demonstrated  through  at  least  one  year's  marketing  
   


evidence  in  accordance  with  Appendix  1  that  there  is  no  realistic  


prospect   of   the   unit   being   used   for   A1   retail.  


C. All  proposals  for  change  of  use  away  from  A1  retail  uses  within  a  Local  

 
 
Shopping   Centre   must   meet   the   following   criteria:  
 
i. The  proposal  is  for  another  A-class  use  or  meets  local  community  


needs;   and  
 
ii. The  proposal  will  not  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  vitality  and  


viability  of  the  centre  as  a  whole  and/or  on  the  individual  shop  unit;  

 


and   
  
iii. A   shop   front   and   active   frontage   is   retained   or   provided.  
 
  
 
 
9.11 Hackney's  Local  Shopping  Centres  provide  a  range  of  retailing  and  community  

 


services  to  meet  the  day-to-day  needs  of  all  members  of  the  local  community  


within  reasonable  walking  distance.  These  centres  are  particularly  important  for  


less  mobile  members  of  the  community  and  those  who  may  not  wish  to  travel  


far.   
  
 
 
9.12 In  order  to  maintain  a  range  of  retail  services  within  the  Local  Shopping  Centres,  

 


A1  uses  should  constitute  at  least  50%  of  all  units  within  the  centre.  Any  


proposed  change  of  use  that  would  result  in  the  proportion  of  retail  units  in  the  


local  shopping  centre  falling  below  the  50%  threshold  is  required  to  provide  


marketing  evidence  to  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  demand  for  retail  in  this  


location.  All  changes  of  use  away  from  retail  must  also  meet  all  criteria  in  


section   C   of   the   policy.  
 

## Lp36  Shops  Outside  Of  Designated  Centres

 
 
A. Individual  shops  or  parades  outside  of  designated  town  and  local  


centres  will  be  safeguarded  for  A1  retail  purposes.  Development  


involving  the  loss  of  A1  retail  will  be  permitted  if  all  of  the  following  

 


criteria   are   met:  
 
i. There  are  alternative  shopping  facilities  for  local  residents  within  


reasonable  walking  distance  of  400m  from  the  retail  unit,  also  taking  


into   account   shops   within   neighbouring   boroughs;   and  
 
ii. The  retail  character  of  the  parade  is  not  undermined  (if  it  forms  part  

 

 
 
 
of   a   parade);   and  
 
iii. The   proposed   use   is   an   A-class   or   community   use;   and  
 
iv. A   shop   front   and   active   frontage   is   retained   or   provided.  


B.
 If  all  of  the  above  criteria  are  not  met  then  marketing  evidence  of  at  
  


least  one  year  must  be  provided  in  accordance  with  Appendix  1  


demonstrating  that  there  is  no  realistic  prospect  of  the  unit  being  used  

 


for   A1   retail.  


9.13 Non-designated  local  shopping  parades  or  individual  shops  such  as  newsagents  


or  corner  shops  have  a  key  role  in  providing  access  to  day-to-day  necessities  

 


within  walking  distance  from  home.  A1  uses  within  these  non-designated  


centres  should  be  retained  in  line  with  the  criteria  in  the  policy  in  order  to  


provide   local   facilities   in   sustainable   locations.  
 

## Lp37  Small  And  Independent  Shops

A. The  provision  of  small  A1  shop  units  suitable  for  small  and  


independent   retailers   will   be   supported.   
  
i. New  retail  development  of  more  than  1000sqm  gross  internal  


floorspace  in  designated  town  centres  must  incorporate  small  shop  


premises,  equivalent  to  at  least  10%  of  the  total  amount  of  proposed  


gross   internal   retail   floorspace.  
 
ii. Major  developments  must  incorporate  small  shop  units  where  there  


is  no  accessible  provision  of  alternative  shopping  facilities  within  


400m 
 walking 
 distance, 
 taking 
 into 
 account 
 shops 
 within  


neighbouring   boroughs.  
 
iii. New  retail  development  will  be  subject  to  conditions  to  prevent  the  


future  amalgamation  of  units  into  larger  premises  without  planning  


permission.   
  
 
 
B. Any  proposal  involving  sub-division  of  an  A1  retail  unit  or  partial  loss  of  


A1   retail   floorspace   must   demonstrate   that:  
 
i. The  function  of  the  unit  will  not  be  materially  altered,  i.e.  that  the  


floorspace  of  the  remaining  retail  unit  is  sufficient  to  allow  its  


continued   operation   as   a   shop   or   other   town   centre   use;   and  
  
ii. The   future   viability   of   the   unit   and   the   centre   will   not   be   harmed.   
  
 
 
C. Amalgamation  of  individual  A1  shop  units  will  be  permitted  in  the  


primary   frontages   of   major   town   centres.   
  


9.14 A  small  shop  is  considered  to  be  less  than  80sqm  gross  internal  floorspace  and  

 


is  often  occupied  by  an  independent  retailer  which  has  nine  units  or  less  in  


operation  nationally  (as  per  the  Experian  Goad  map  definition).  Hackney's  many  


small  and  independent  shops  contribute  to  the  special  character  and  identity  of  


Hackney's  neighbourhoods  and  add  to  the  distinctiveness  and  variety  of  


Hackney  as  a  place  to  live  and  visit.  In  addition,  affordability  is  a  key  concern  for  
 
  

  


small  enterprises  in  Hackney  and,  by  virtue  of  their  size,  small  shop  units  are  


generally  more  affordable  and  accessible  to  independent  or  start-up  shop  


businesses  and  independent  traders.  The  Council  therefore  seeks  to  retain  and  


promote   small   shop   units   across   the   Borough.  


9.15 In  order  to  encourage  greater  provision  of  small  shop  units  within  the  Borough,  


new  retail  development  within  Hackney's  designated  centres  which  are  over  


1000sqm  are  required  to  incorporate  small  shop  premises  for  occupation  by  


small  and  independent  retailers  amounting  to  10%  of  the  gross  internal  


floorspace.  In  addition,  proposals  for  major  development  schemes  may  also  be  


required  to  provide  small  shop  units  where  no  alternative  shopping  facilities  are  

available  within  400m  walking  distance,  to  ensure  all  members  of  the  community  


have  reasonable  access  to  local  shops  for  day-to-day  needs.  This  would  be  


secured   through   planning   obligations.   
  
 
 
9.16 Whilst  small  retail  units  are  encouraged,  in  some  cases,  retail  units  (all  A  


classes)  are  subdivided  to  allow  for  new  residential  uses  at  the  rear  or  improved  


access  to  residential  units  on  upper  floors  and  whilst  this  may  be  acceptable  in  


line  with  other  policies  in  this  chapter  and  as  part  of  the  wider  redevelopment  of  


a  site,  sub-division  can  sometimes  result  in  'token'  retail  units  being  created  


which  are  too  small  for  the  requirements  of  occupants.  In  order  to  avoid  this,  all  


proposals  involving  sub-division  of  an  A1  retail  unit  or  partial  loss  of  A1  retail  


floorspace  must  satisfy  the  criteria  in  part  B  of  the  policy  to  ensure  that  the  shop  

 
  


unit   remains   of   a   size   and   layout   that   is   viable   for   current   and   future   occupiers.   
  
 
 
9.17 Amalgamation  of  small  shop  units  will  only  be  permitted  in  the  primary  frontages  

 


of  major  town  centres  where  the  provision  of  larger  retail  floorplates  can  be  


more  attractive  to  a  wider  range  of  potential  end-users.  Amalgamation  of  small  

 


shop  units  will  be  resisted  in  all  other  locations  as  this  can  result  in  material  


impacts  to  Hackney's  shopping  areas  relating  to  character  and  intensification  of  


use.  

## Lp38  Evening  And  Night  Time  Economy

 
 
A. New  evening  and  night-time  economy  uses  will  be  primarily  located  in  

 
the  Borough's  designated  centres.  The  use  should  be  of  a  size  and  

 
 
 
type   that   reflects   the   role   and   function   of   the   centre   including   the   CAZ.  


B. Proposals  for  uses  that  would  result  in  the  diversification  of  the  


evening  and  night  time  economy  will  be  supported.  Only  limited  


expansion  of  licensed  premises  will  be  permitted  in  Shoreditch  and  


Dalston.  


C. Proposals  for  evening  and  night  time  economy  uses  will  be  permitted  if  

 
both   of   the   following   criteria   are   met:  
 
i. There  is  no  negative  impact  on  the  amenity  of  adjoining  or  adjacent  


residential  accommodation  and  non-residential  uses,  such  as  

through  noise  disturbance,  cooking  smells,  anti-social  behaviour,  and  


highway   safety;   and  
 
ii. There  are  no  negative  cumulative  impacts  resulting  from  the  


proposed  use  in  relation  to  the  number,  capacity  and  location  of  

other   night-time   economy   uses   in   the   area.  


9.18 Evening  and  night-time  economy  uses  are  comprised  of  a  wide  range  of  uses  

 


including  A3  restaurants,  A4  drinking  establishments,  D2  uses  such  as  cinemas,  


dance  and  concert  halls,  music  venues  and  bingo  halls  and  some  sui  generis  


uses  such  as  casinos,  theatres,  music  venues  and  nightclubs.  Evening  and  


night-time  economy  uses  contribute  to  the  vitality  and  vibrancy  of  town  centres  


and   contribute   positively   to   the   visitor   experience   and   local   economy.   
  
 
 
9.19 There  is,  however,  an  over-emphasis  in  certain  parts  of  the  Borough  on  evening  

 


and  night-time  venues  which  encourage  alcohol  consumption  amongst  young  


people,  particularly  bars  and  clubs.  Concentrations  of  these  types  of  evening  


and  night-time  economy  uses  in  any  single  area  can  have  negative  impacts  on  


local  communities  and  residents  including  noise  and  disturbance,  anti-social  


behaviour,   fear   of   crime,   and   environmental   degradation.  
 
  
  
9.20 The  Council's  approach  is  therefore  to  maintain  a  balance  in  the  amount  and  

 


type  of  evening  and  night-time  economy  uses  across  the  Borough.  Managed  


expansion  is  permitted  in  town  centres  but  expansion  of  night  time  economy  


uses  should  be  limited  in  Shoreditch  and  Dalston  where  concentrations  already  


exist  and  Special  Policy  Areas  have  been  implemented  through  the  Council's  


Licensing   Policy.   
  
 
 
9.21 Management  plans  will  be  required  for  any  new  evening  and  night-time  


economy  uses,  planning  obligations  will  be  applied  to  ensure  evening  and  


night-time  uses  operate  appropriately,  and  the  Agent  of  Change  principle  is  


supported  in  line  with  the  National  Planning  Policy  Framework  and  the  emerging  
  


London  Plan.  Night-time  economy  uses  that  would  harm  the  attractiveness  of  


Hackney's  centres  or  the  amenity  of  local  residents,  taking  into  account  cross  


boundary   impacts    will   not   be   permitted.  


9.22 The  Council  promotes  the  establishment  of  a  more  diverse  night-time  offer  


across  the  Borough  that  will  appeal  to  a  wider  range  of  the  community  including  

 


non-alcohol-based  activities  such  as  restaurants,  cultural  activities  and  late  night  


coffee   bars.  

## Lp39  Over-Concentration  Of  Uses Hot   Food   Takeaways

A. Proposals  for  new  hot  food  takeaways  (A5  use  class)  will  only  be  


permitted   where   all   the   following   criteria   are   met:  
 
i. It  is  located  within  a  designated  centre  and  would  not  result  in  more  
  
 
  


than   5%   of   the   units   in   the   centre   as   a   whole   being   A5   uses;   and  
 
ii. There  would  at  least  three  non-A5  units  between  the  proposed  use  


and   an   existing   A5   use;   and  
 
iii. It  is  not  located  within  400  metres  of  the  boundary  of  a  primary  

 
 
school,   secondary   school   or   community   college;   and  
 
iv. A  commitment  is  made  to  operate  in  compliance  with  the  Council's  


Healthy   Catering   Commitment.  
 

## Betting   Shops   And   Payday   Loan   Shops

B. Proposals  for  new  betting  shops  or  payday  loan  shops  (sui  generis  


uses)   will   only   be   permitted   where:  
 
i. It  is  located  within  a  designated  centre  and  would  not  result  in  more  
  
 
  


than  5%  of  the  units  in  the  centre  being  a  betting  shop  or  payday  

 


loan   shop;   and  
 
ii. There  would  be  at  least  three  other  town  centre  uses  between  the  


proposed   use   and   an   existing   betting   shop   or   payday   loan   shop.  


9.23 This  policy  seeks  to  resist  the  development  of  concentrations  of  the  types  of  


uses  that  are  known  to  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the  vitality  and  viability  of  

 


town  centres  and  the  health,  wellbeing  and  amenity  of  residents  and  other  


stakeholders.   
  
 
 
9.24 In  order  to  avoid  an  over-concentration  of  takeaways  within  town  centres,  


development  of  new  takeaways  will  be  resisted  as  outlined  in  criteria  A(i)  and  


A(ii)  of  the  policy.  In  addition,  in  order  to  address  rising  levels  of  childhood  


obesity  in  the  Borough,  permission  will  be  refused  for  the  development  of  new  


hot  food  takeaways  within  400m  of  the  boundary  of  an  existing  or  planned  


primary  or  secondary  school  or  college.  When  assessing  takeaways  within  the  


400m  buffer,  applicants  must  also  take  into  account  uses  within  neighbouring  


boroughs.  Where  takeaways  are  located  in  close  proximity  to  residential  uses,  


opening  hours  may  need  to  be  restricted  to  protect  the  amenity  of  residents.  All  


new  takeaways  are  required  to  operate  in  compliance  with  the  Council's  Healthy  

 


Catering  Commitment  which  is  a  scheme  seeking  to  encourage  fast  food  outlets  

  


to  offer  healthier  options  and  to  reduce  the  level  of  saturated  fats  and  salt  in  


our-projects-food-london/healthier-catering-commitment   
  

 
 
9.25 Clustering  of  betting  shops  and  payday  loan  shops  (classified  as  sui  generis  


uses  since  2015)  can  impact  negatively  on  the  vitality  and  character  of  town  


centres  and  gambling  can  be  harmful  for  some  people.  The  Council  will  


therefore  resist  proposals  for  betting  shops  or  payday  loan  shops  in  line  with  the  

 


criteria   in   the   policy.  
 

## Lp40  Street  Markets


A. The  Council  will  protect  and  promote  the  street  markets  of  Ridley  


Road,  Hoxton  Street,  Broadway  Market,  Kingsland,  Well  Street  and  


Chatsworth   Road.  
 
i. Development  which  would  result  in  the  permanent  loss  of  markets  or  


pitches  will  be  refused  unless  appropriate  comparable  replacement  


provision   is   made.  
 


B. New  or  expanded  markets  should  be  located  within  the  Borough's  


designated   centres.  
 


C. Proposals  for  new  markets  and  market  stalls  will  be  permitted  provided  

they  will  not  cause  individual  or  cumulative  harm  to  the  local  area  in  


terms  of  residential  amenity,  pedestrian  and  highway  safety,  parking  


congestion  or  the  free  flow  of  traffic,  especially  public  transport.  This  


must   be   set   out   in   a   Management   Plan   provided   with   any   application.  


9.26 Hackney's  street  markets  contribute  to  the  economic,  social  and  cultural  life  of  


the  Borough,  offering  a  range  of  goods  and  services  for  Hackney's  diverse  


communities  and  contributing  to  the  vitality,  diversity  and  attraction  of  shopping  


in  the  Borough.  Existing  markets  will  be  protected  and  additional  or  expanded  


markets  within  town  centres  will  be  supported  if  formally  designated  by  the  

 


Council.   
  
 
 
9.27 The  Council  would  resist  development  proposals  that  would  result  in  the  loss  of  

 


markets  and  pitches,  unless  appropriate  comparable  re-provision  is  made.  


Proposals  for  markets  or  individual  market  stalls  should  submit  a  Management  

 
 
Plan  to  include  provision  for  careful  management  and  design  features,  and,  


where  appropriate,  contribute  towards  environmental  and  street  improvements  


and  initiatives  such  as  improving  areas  for  parking  and  servicing.  The  Council  


will  use  conditions  and/or  obligations  to  ensure  the  operation  of  markets  do  not  


have  harmful  impacts,  and  require  detailed  layout  plans  as  part  of  an  


application.   
  
  

## 10. Improving   Accessibility   And Promoting   Sustainable   Transport Promoting  Sustainable,  Efficient  Healthy  And  Clean  Transport

10.1 Hackney  seeks  to  integrate  sustainable  transport  and  growth  so  that  new  jobs  


and  homes  are  located  together  in  places  highly  accessible  to  public  transport  


with  a  high  quality  safe  urban  realm.  This  should  mean  that  people  of  all  ages  
  


and  backgrounds  increasingly  choose  to  travel  by  walking,  cycling  and  public  


transport  bringing  the  health  benefits  of  accessibility,  physical  exercise  and  


clean  air  while  encouraging  the  efficient  use  of  limited  street  space  by  


low-emission   vehicles   to   ease   traffic  congestion.  
 

## Key  Facts

●
Car  ownership  levels  in  Hackney  fell  between  2001  and  2011  with  the  


proportion   of   households   with   a   car   dropping   from  44%   to   34%.   
  
●
Walking  levels  in  Hackney  have  been  increasing  over  the  years;  39%  of  


people  in  Hackney  use  walking  as  their  main  mode  of  transport  over  a  

 
seven   day   period,   compared   to   the   Greater   London   average   of   32%.   
  
●
Cycle  space  provision  in  approved  developments  almost  quadrupled  


between   2015/16   and   2016/17.   
  
●
The  latest  census  (2011)  showed  more  Hackney  commuters  cycle  to  work  


(15.4%)   than   go   by   car   (12.7%).   
  
●
Annual  usage  of  London  Overground  stations  in  Hackney  more  than  


trebled   in   the   seven   years   between   2010   and   2017.   
  

## Chapter  Objectives:

●
To  create  liveable  and  accessible  neighbourhoods  where  people  choose  to  


walk,  cycle  and  socialise,  and  support  the  development  of  a  network  for  

 
 
 
electric   vehicles.  
 
●
To  support  improvements  to  the  public  transport  network  and  maximise  the  


community  and  regeneration  benefits  and  opportunities  to  come  from  


Crossrail   2.  

## Lp41  Liveable  Neighbourhoods

A. New  development  and  its  associated  transport  systems  should  


contribute  towards  transforming  Hackney's  places  and  streets  into  one  


of   the   most   attractive   and   liveable   neighbourhoods   in   London.   
  
 
 
B. All   new   development   must:   
  
i. Create  an  environment  where  people  actively  choose  to  walk  and  


cycle   as   part   of   everyday   life.   
  
ii. Reduce  the  dominance  of  the  car  both  in  terms  of  traffic  and  


congestion  on  our  roads  and  managing  excessive  parking  on  our  


streets.   
  
iii. Contribute  to  the  *Healthy  Streets*  approach  to  improve  air  quality,  


manage  congestion  and  make  Hackney's  diverse  communities  


become  greener,  healthier  and  more  attractive  places  in  which  to  


live,   play   and   do   business.  
 
iv. Contribute  to  a  safe  road  environment  where  traffic  accident  


casualties   are   steadily   reduced   supporting    *Vision   Zero*    objectives.  
 
v. Contribute  towards  greening  our  neighbourhoods:  creating  a  cleaner,  

 
 
healthier  environment  that  is  able  to  cope  with  changes  to  the  


climate.   
  
vi. Make  improvements  to  the  pedestrian  environment  including  the  


provision  of  high  quality  public  realm,  safe  road  crossings,  water  


fountains,  seating,  wayfinding  and  increased  tree  and  vegetation  


coverage.  Provide  and  where  appropriate  financially  contribute 


towards  creating  well  connected,  high  quality,  convenient  and  safe  


cycle   routes   and   infrastructure.  
 
vii. Tackle  poor  air  quality,  seeking  to  reduce  NOx  emissions  to  achieve  


the  National  Air  Quality  objective  and  in  particular  reduce  the  


exposure  of  children  and  vulnerable  people  to  transport-related  air  


pollution.  
 
viii. Provide  for  and  financially  contributing  towards  measures  to  support  


Low  Emission  Neighbourhoods  (LENs)  including  but  not  limited  to  


the  increased  use  of  car  sharing,  low  emission  vehicles  including  


taxis,  freight  consolidation  and  associated  engagement  with  


businesses,   residents   and   other   stakeholders   to   support   these   aims.  
 
ix. Improve  permeability  and  the  reallocation  of  road  space  away  from  


car   use   to   promote   walking,   cycling   and   use   of   public   transport.  


10.2 Hackney  is  committed  to  improving  the  quality  of  life  for  people  who  live,  work  or  
  


visit  the  Borough.  The  Liveable  Neighbourhoods  policy  aims  to  build  upon  the  


Borough's  success  in  creating  liveable  and  sustainable  neighbourhoods,  


demonstrated  by  Hackney  having  both  the  third  lowest  levels  of  car  ownership  


in   England   and   one   of   the   highest   levels   of   cycling   and   bus   usage   in   London.  


10.3 The  Council  is  committed  to  working  in  partnership  to  promote  safe,  sustainable,  
 
  

 


and  accessible  transport  solutions,  which  minimise  the  impacts  of  development,  


mitigate  the  impact  of  air  pollution,  maximise  health  benefits  and  provide  easy  


access  to  local  services  and  employment  opportunities.  This  is  consistent  with  

 
 
 
the  approach  outlined  by  the  Government's  National  Planning  Policy  Framework  


and  the  London  Plan  (March  2016).  Reducing  car  use  and  promoting  active  


travel  also  contributes  to  the  Hackney  Health  and  Wellbeing  Strategy  priority  to  


reduce   childhood   obesity.  


10.4 The  purpose  of  Hackney's  Transport  Strategy  2015-2025  is  to  encourage  more  

 


walking,  cycling  and  use  of  public  transport  for  those  who  live,  work  and  visit  the  


Borough  and  to  continue  to  reduce  the  need  for  private  car  use.  The  Strategy  


supports  the  objectives  set  out  in  the  Mayor  of  London's  Draft  Transport  


Strategy   2017.   
  
 
 
10.5 The  Council  will  work  to  adapt  our  public  realm  and  promote  a  vision  for 


neighbourhoods  in  Hackney  encompassing  improved  health,  carbon  reduction  


and  improved  air  quality,  cohesive  communities,  economic  prosperity,  quality  of  


life   and   equality   of   opportunity.   
  

## Lp42  Walking  And  Cycling

 
 
A. All  new  development  must  promote  sustainable  transport  by  


prioritising   walking   and   cycling   in   the   Borough. Walking  
 
B. New   development   will   be   permitted   where   it:  
 
i. Improves  the  pedestrian  environment  and  contributes  towards  


achieving  a  world  class  public  realm  linking  the  site  to  transport  


infrastructure  as  well  as  facilities  and  amenities  including  the  


provision  of  high  quality  safe  road  crossings  where  needed,  seating,  


signage   and   increased   tree   and   vegetation   coverage.  
 
ii. Is   permeable   -   easy   and   safe   to   walk   through   -   and   adequately   lit.  
 
iii. Provides  high  quality  footpaths  that  are  wide  enough  for  the  number  


of  people  expected  to  use  them  and  designed  to  be  suitable  for  


vulnerable   road   users   including   older   people   and   disabled   people.   
  
iv. Contributes  towards  improved  wayfinding  including  signposted  links  


such  as  TFL's  Legible  London  to  key  infrastructure,  transport  nodes,  


green   spaces   and   canal   towpaths   where   appropriate.  
 

## Cycling

C. In  order  to  promote  cycling  in  the  Borough  and  ensure  a  safe  and  

 
 
 
accessible  environment  for  cyclists,  the  Council  will  seek  to  ensure  


that   development:   
  
i. Provides  for  and  makes  contributions  towards  connected,  high  


quality,  convenient  and  safe  cycle  routes  for  all,  in  line  or  exceeding  


London   Cycle   Design   Standards.  
 
ii. Contributes  to  a  world  class  public  realm  which  reduces  vehicle  


dominance  and  supports  sustainable  transport  in  particular  walking  


and   cycling.  
 
iii. Provides  cycle  parking  for  building  users  and  visitors  to  the  


development  in  accordance  with  Hackney's  cycle  parking  standards  


(see  Appendix  2).  Cycle  parking  shall  be  secure,  accessible,  


convenient,  and  weatherproof  and  will  include  an  adequate  level  of  


parking   suitable   for   accessible   bicycles,   tricycles   and   cargo   bikes.   
  
iv. Makes  provision  for  high  quality  facilities  that  promote  cycle  usage  


including  workplace  showers,  changing  room  and  lockers.  The  


provision  should  be  proportionate  to  the  scale  of  development  and  


cycle   parking   provided.  
 
v. Provides  links  to  public  transport  nodes  as  well  as  facilities  and  


amenities.  
 
vi. Contributes   towards   improved   wayfinding.  
 
vii. Promotes  and  contributes  towards  the  introduction  and  expansion  of  


cycle   hire   facilities.  


10.6 In  recent  years,  Hackney  has  sought  to  develop  a  policy  of  re-prioritising  the  

 


needs  of  road  users  away  from  the  car  and  more  towards  pedestrians,  cyclists  


and  public  transport  users  in  line  with  National  Guidance.  At  a  local  level,  


Hackney  has  sought  to  improve  conditions  through  a  variety  of  interventions  

 


including  upgrading  the  public  realm,  managing  parking  demand  through  


controlled  parking  zones,  removing  gyratories  and  one  way  streets,  and  


introducing  traffic  calming  measures.  The  Council  will  seek  to  continue  this  


policy   when   assessing   planning   applications.   
  
 
 
10.7 The  Council  will  also  seek  improvements  such  as  the  provision  of  new  


walking/cycling  paths  from  new  housing  developments,  contributions  towards  


the  provision  of  cycle  parking  and  cycle  hire  schemes,  better  station  


interchanges,  accessible  bus  stops,  etc.  to  the  sustainable  transport  network  to  


further  facilitate  prioritisation  towards  the  needs  of  pedestrians,  cyclists  and  


public   transport   users.  
 

 
 
10.8 High  motor  traffic  flows  and  congestion  contribute  to  poor  air  quality,  which  is  a  

  
major  contributory  factor  to  ill  health  in  the  Borough  as  it  can  affect  lung  


function,  exacerbate  asthma  and  increase  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  


disease  (local  estimates  for  Hackney  suggest  that  as  many  as  7%  of  all  deaths  


9
in  2014  can  be  attributed  to  air  pollution)  .  Noise  pollution  from  transport  can  


also  cause  a  number  of  health  issues  including  sleep  disturbance,  hearing  


impairment,  heightened  cortisol  in  the  blood  (a  marker  of  stress)  and  impairment  

 


of  cognitive  performance  in  children,  as  well  as  increased  risk  of  developing  


cardiovascular  disease  in  those  exposed  long-term  to  noise  pollution.  Road  


traffic  accidents  resulting  from  motorised  vehicles  are  a  key  concern  (with  290  

 


people  killed  or  seriously  injured  on  the  road  in  Hackney  between  2012  and  


2014),  particularly  because  of  health  inequalities  relating  to  ethnicity  and  


socio-economic  status.  Creating  a  better  balance  between  pedestrians,  cyclists  

 


and  motor  vehicles  is  therefore  critical  if  we  are  to  make  our  neighbourhoods  

 


more   attractive   and   liveable   for   everyone.   
  
 
 
10.9 Transport  choices  can  have  a  huge  impact  on  people's  health.  Sustainable  


transport  choices  such  as  walking  and  cycling  which  increase  physical  activity  


help  prevent  or  manage  over  20  health  conditions  and  diseases  including  


coronary  heart  disease,  diabetes,  some  cancers  and  obesity.  Physical  activity  is  

 
also  good  for  mental  wellbeing  and  can  help  older  people  maintain  independent  


lives  for  longer.  An  estimated  53,000  adults  in  Hackney  are  failing  to  achieve  


even  30  minutes  of  moderate  activity  a  week,  and  90%  of  15  year  olds  are  

 


failing  to  achieve  the  recommended  levels  of  physical  activity  for  their  age  


group.  Active  travel  may  be  the  main  way  that  Hackney  residents  meet  their  


physical  activity  needs.  The  UK  Faculty  of  Public  Health  states  that  active  travel  


is  the  only  viable  option  for  significantly  increasing  physical  activity  levels  across  


London's  whole  population  (Public  Health  paper  2013).  There  are  also  health  


inequalities  in  use  of  active  travel:  Hackney's  Joint  Strategic  Needs  Assessment  


highlights  that  non-White  groups  in  Hackney  were  less  likely  to  cycle  than  


average.  
 

## Lp43  Transport  And  Development

A. New  development  should  be  located  where  its  transport  needs  can  be  


met   in   a   sustainable   manner.  


B. Any  significant  negative  impact  on  the  operation  of  transport  


infrastructure,   must   be   satisfactorily   mitigated.  


C. Major  development  proposals  are  required  to  include  the  submission  


of  either  a  Transport  Assessment  and  Travel  Plan,  or  a  Transport  


Statement  and  Local  Level  Travel  Plan,  in  accordance  with  the  London  

 


Borough  of  Hackney  thresholds  and  in  line  with  Transport  for  London  


(TfL)   Guidance.  


D. New   development   will   be   permitted   where   it:  
 
i. Reduces  the  need  to  travel  and  encourages  high-density  and  


high-trip  generating  development  around  transport  nodes  and  highly  


accessible   areas.  
 
ii. Integrates  land  use  and  transport  and  will  encourage  mixed  use  


developments   which   support   compact   growth   and   regeneration.  
 
iii. Minimises  the  demand  for  car  trips  and  enables  new  residents  to  


make   journeys   by   active   modes   and   public   transport.  
 
iv. Fully  mitigates  any  adverse  impacts  upon  the  capacity  of  transport  


infrastructure  and  public  transport  services,  including  pavements  and  


other  walking  routes,  cycle  routes,  bus  and  rail  services,  rail  stations  


and   roads.  
 
v. The 
 transport 
 and 
 environmental 
 impacts 
 of 
 development  


construction  must  be  minimised  and  mitigated  through  Constructions  


and  Logistics  Plans  (CLPs)  incorporating  adherence  to  the  


Construction  and  Logistics  Community  Safety  Scheme  (CLOCS)  and  


the  Freight  Operator  Recognition  Scheme  (FORS) 
 On-site  


machinery  and  vehicles  used  should  comply  with  industry  


best-practice  emission  standards  contributing  to  the  Council's  air  


quality   objectives.  
 
vi. Assesses  the  ongoing  freight  impact  of  the  development  and  


minimises  and  mitigates  the  impacts  of  this  on  the  transport  system  


through  Delivery  and  Servicing  Plans  (DSPs)  including  references  to  


10
use  of  low-emission,  freight  consolidation  and  sustainable  last  mile  


delivery   vehicles.   
  

 
 
10.10 Hackney  will  consider  the  impacts  of  movement  to,  from  and  within  a  site  


including  links  to  existing  transport  networks  via  transport  assessments,  travel  


plans,  delivery  and  servicing  management  plans  and  construction  management  


plans.  The  Council's  aim  is  to  minimise  the  impact  of  development  and  


maximise  opportunities  to  provide  safe  sustainable  transport  access  to  services,  


facilities   and   employment.  
 

## Lp44  Public  Transport  And  Infrastructure

All   development   must:   
  

A. Protect  existing  and  proposed  transport  infrastructure,  particularly  


routes  for  walking,  cycling  and  public  transport,  from  removal  or  


severance  which  could  compromise  their  use  or  operation.  Proposals  


which  are  contrary  to  the  safeguarding  of  strategic  infrastructure  


improvement   projects,   including   Crossrail   2   will   be   refused.  


In   addition   new   major   development   must:  

B. Contribute  towards  improvements  to  the  bus  network  and  associated  


infrastructure  including  new  bus  services,  bus  priority  measures  and  


frequency   upgrades.  


C. Contribute  to  improving  rail  infrastructure  at  local  stations  including  


travel   interchange   facilities   and   step   free   access.  


D. Support  sustainable  transport  initiatives  such  as  cycle  hire  facilities,  


electric  vehicle  charging  infrastructure  and  pocket  parks.  On-Street  car  


club  development  will  be  supported  when  delivered  in  conjunction  with  

 
 
 
an  overall  reduction  in  car  parking  or  other  effective  demand  


management   measures.  


E. Contribute  to  public  realm  improvements  which  improve  access  to  


public   transport   facilities   by   promoting   walking   and   cycling.  


10.11 Hackney  will  continue  to  work  with  relevant  partner  organisations  including  TfL  


to  secure  improvements  to  public  transport.   Where  appropriate,  developers  will  


be  required  to  contribute  to  improving  walking,  cycling  and  public  transport  


infrastructure.  Due  contributions  will  be  secured  through  the  Community  


Infrastructure  Levy  or  S106  agreements,  where  these  meet  the  legal  tests  for  


the  use  of  planning  obligations,  or  alternative  arrangements  where  applicable.  


This   is   subject   to   the   overall   viability   of   development.   
  

## Lp45  Parking  And  Car  Free  Development

A. In  order  to  reduce  car  usage  and  promote  active  travel,  all  new  


developments  in  the  Borough  must  be  car-free;  on-site  parking  limited  


to:  
 
i.  Parking  for  disabled  users,  which  is  required  to  be  provided  in  


accordance  with  best  practice  standards,  as  set  out  in  the  London  


Plan.  
 
ii.    Essential   operational   or   servicing   needs   as   justified   through   a Transport   Assessment.  
 
B. Where  sites  are  redeveloped  existing  parking  provision  must  be  


significantly  reduced  to  make  the  new  development  car  free  unless  


there  is  site  specific  justification  to  re-provide  an  element  of  the  


existing  parking.  In  housing  estate  development  schemes,  parking  


provision  may  be  retained  or  re-provided  where  it  can  be  


demonstrated   that:  
 
i. Existing  occupiers  with  established  parking  spaces  or  permits  are  to  


return  to  the  site  once  the  development  is  completed  and  that  the  


retained   or   re-provided   parking   is   for   those   residents   only;   and  
 
ii. Where  necessary,  there  is  evidence  of  adequate  capacity  within  the  

 


relevant  controlled  parking  zone  if  the  re-provided  parking  is  to  be  

 


on-street;   and   
  
iii. The  retained  or  re-provided  parking  is  delivered  as  part  of  an  overall  

 


package  of  measures  improving  legibility,  including  walking  and  


cycling   routes,   and   making   improvements   to   the   public   realm If   a   development   is   to   have   entirely   new   occupiers   it  must   be   car   free.  


C. Proposals  for  the  redevelopment  of  existing  car  parks  for  alternative  


uses  will  be  supported  and  the  removal  of  boundary  treatments  and  


gardens  to  provide  vehicle  crossovers  and  on-site  parking  will  be  


resisted.  
 

 
 
D. New  development  must  incorporate  designated  spaces  for  deliveries  


within  the  boundary  of  the  development,  where  appropriate  and  


provide  Delivery  and  Servicing  plans  which  encourage  provision  for  


low-emission,   consolidation   and   last   mile   delivery   modes.   
  
 
 
E.
A  minimum  of  one  fifth  of  all  off-street  parking  places  created  need  to  


be  equipped  with  electric  vehicle  charging  infrastructure  in  line  with  


11
the  London  Plan. 
 Facilities  for  charging  electric  Powered  Two  


Wheel  vehicles  should  also  be  considered.  Contributions  will  also  be  


required  for  on-street  provision  of  electric  vehicle  and  other  low  


emission   vehicle   infrastructure.  


F.
All  major  residential  developments  will  be  required  to  contribute  


towards  the  expansion  of  the  local  car  club  network  including  those  


using   low-emission   vehicles.  


G.
Proposals  for,  or  including,  new  public  car  parks  (and  other  motor  


vehicle  public  parking,  including  for  coaches)  will  be  refused.  


Proposals  for  the  redevelopment  of  existing  car  parks  for  a  different  

 
 
use  shall  be  subject  to  the  car-free  and  Transport  Assessment  need  


requirements   within   this   policy.   
  


10.12 The  effective  management  of  parking  spaces  is  a  key  determinant  of  transport  

  


mode  choice  and  an  important  tool  for  tackling  congestion  and  local  pollution  in  

 
the  Borough.  Limiting  the  opportunities  for  parking  can  also  improve  the  


attractiveness  of  an  area  for  local  walking  and  cycling.  The  National  Planning  


Policy  Framework  advises  that  local  authorities  should  consider  an  area's  


accessibility,  type,  mix  and  use  of  development,  availability  of  public  transport,  


local  car  ownership  levels  and  the  need  to  reduce  the  use  of  high-emission  


vehicles  if  setting  local  parking  standards.  Similarly,  the  London  Plan  identifies  
  


the  need  to  manage  parking  as  a  key  tool  to  minimise  car  use  and  promote  

 


sustainable   means   of   transport.  


10.13 Hackney  will  promote  car  free  developments  throughout  the  Borough  and  will  


seek  to  carefully  manage  essential  car  parking  levels.  Housing  Estate  


Regeneration  schemes  will  be  expected  to  attain  an  overall  reduction  in  car  


parking  provision  over  time.  The  Borough  has  historically  low  car  ownership  


levels  given  the  high  propensity  of  our  residents  to  walk,  cycle  and  use  public  


transport.  However,  there  are  existing  issues  in  relation  to  congestion,  pollution  


and  parking  stress  in  the  Borough  which  the  Council  would  seek  to  improve.  


This  management  process  will  reflect  local  characteristics  and  be  appropriate  to  


public  transport  accessibility  and  variations  in  controlled  parking  zone  coverage  


and   parking   stress   across   the   Borough.  
 

 
 
10.14 The  dense  urban  character  of  Hackney  means  that  on  site  servicing  may  not  be  


feasible  on  highly  constrained  sites,  such  as  those  in  town  centres.  


Development  proposals  should  therefore  facilitate  sustainable  freight  and  


servicing,  including  the  provision  of  adequate  space  for  servicing  and  deliveries  


off   street,   where   appropriate. 
  

## 11. Hackney'S   Green   And   Open   Spaces

11.1 Hackney  has  almost  400  hectares  of  open  space.  Hackney's  parks  and  green  


spaces  are  of  a  high  quality.  They  vary  in  size,  ranging  from  large  areas  of  

 


Metropolitan  Open  Land  at  the  Lee  Valley  Regional  Park,  which  accounts  for  


almost  40%  of  the  Borough's  open  space,  to  pockets  of  grass  by  the  side  of  


roads.  The  network  of  open  spaces,  waterways  and  the  public  realm  is  at  the  


core  of  the  Borough's  green  infrastructure  with  many  being  multi-functional  


assets  which  can  have  ecological  and  quality  of  life  benefits  for  the  community.  


Many   of   these   spaces   are   also   designated   or   non-designated   heritage   assets.  
 

## Key  Facts

●
25   parks   in   Hackney   have   been   awarded   Green   Flag   status   (as   of   2018).  
 
●
Approximately  three  quarters  of  Hackney  residents  do  not  have  access  to  


a   private   garden.  
 
●
There   are   395   hectares   of   open   space   in   the   Borough.   
  
●
Hackney   Marshes   supports   up   to   82   football,   rugby   and   cricket   pitches.  
 

## Chapter  Objective:

●
To  protect  and  enhance  existing  open  spaces  and  biodiversity,  develop  and  


improve  green  links  between  these  spaces  and  support  the  creation  of  new  


and   open   spaces   and   vertical   gardens.  
 

## Lp46 Protection And Enhancement Of Green Infrastructure

A. All  new  development  should  enhance  the  network  of  green  


infrastructure  and  water  spaces  across  the  Borough  and  seek  to  


improve   access   to   open   space,   particularly   in   areas   of   deficiency.   
  
 
 
B. The  Council  will  protect  and  enhance  Metropolitan  Open  Land  in  


accordance   with   the   London   Plan   and   national   Green   Belt   policy.   
  
 
 
C. Development  involving  the  loss  of  Local  Open  space  or  of  playing  


fields   will   not   be   permitted   unless:  
 
i. there  is  compensatory  contiguous  replacement  of  better  or  


equivalent  quantity  and  quality  of  playing  fields  or  public  open  space  


and  setting  including  facilities  to  enhance  or  diversify  people's  


experience   of   the   open   space;   and   
  
ii. replacement  is  in  a  location  with  better  or  equivalent  access  by  


walking,   cycling   or   public   transport;   and   
  
iii. the  quality  of  the  remaining  and  replacement  open  space  is  not  


eroded   by   the   proposed   development.  


D. Development   on   other   open   space   will   only   be   permitted   where:   
  
i. replacement  and/or  enhancement  of  open  space  of  better  or  


equivalent  quality  is  provided  either  on  site  or  a  location  within  the  

 


vicinity   of   the   site,   especially   in   the   identified   areas   of   deficiency,   and   
  
ii. wherever  possible  any  replacement  connects  to  the  network  of  green  


infrastructure   including   the   green   chains   and   green   corridors,   or   
  
iii. it  can  be  shown  that  the  relationship  between  buildings  and  


associated  open  space(s)  can  be  improved  in  terms  of  use,  security,  


setting   and   landscape   quality.  


E. Small  scale  ancillary  developments  which  enhance  the  park  and  open  


space  offer,  such  as  refreshment  facilities,  public  conveniences,  


drinking  fountains,  public  art  installations  or  outdoor  play  and  fitness  


equipment   will   be   permitted   provided   that   they   are:   
  
i. Of  a  high  standard  of  design  and  quality,  safe  and  accessible  to  all;  
  


and  
 
ii. Do  not  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  nature  conservation  and  


biodiversity,   and   should   seek   to   improve   such;   and  
 
iii. Do  not  result  in  the  loss  of  functional  open  space  where  possible;  


and   
  
iv. Do  not  detract  from  the  overall  function,  character  and  appearance  


of   the   park   or   open   space.  

## F. Living   Roofs  And   Vertical   Forests

i. Living  roofs  are  required  on  major  development  schemes  that  


include   roof   plates   of   over   100sqm.  
 
ii. Living  roofs  and  vertical  forests  are  encouraged  on  all  development  


proposals,  including  minor  schemes,  renovations,  extensions  and  


conversions.   
  
iii. Living  Roofs  must  be  high  quality  and  genuinely  biodiverse  in  


accordance  with  the  specifications  set  out  in  the  Biodiversity  Action  


Plan   (BAP).  

## G. **Allotments   And   Food   Growing**

i. The  Council  will  protect  existing  allotments  and  support  the  provision  


of   new   food   growing   spaces.  

## H. **Lee   Valley   Regional   Park**

i. Development  proposals  in  proximity  to  the  Lee  Valley  Regional  Park  


should   improve   access   and   links   to   the   park   and   its  waterways.   
  
ii. The  Council  will  work  cooperatively  with  the  Lee  Valley  Regional  


Park  Authority  to  deliver  the  Lee  Valley  Park  Development  


Framework  Area  Proposals  and  the  Lee  Valley  Biodiversity  Action  


Plan   2017.  
 

 
 
11.2 Green  Infrastructure  is  the  network  of  multi-functional  green  space  across  the 


Borough,  delivering  a  wide  range  of  environmental,  health  and  wellbeing,  social  
 
  


and  recreational  benefits  for  Hackney's  communities  as  outlined  in  the  Green  


Infrastructure   Task   Force's  objectives   for   green   infrastructure   in   London:  


1. Promoting  Healthy  Living:  improving  health  outcomes  by  increasing  


physical   activity,   reducing   stress   and   removing   pollutants.  
 
2. Strengthening  Resilient  Living:  keeping  the  city  cool,  its  air  clean,  and  


protecting   it  from  flooding.  
 
3. Encouraging   Active   Living:   increasing   levels   of   walking   and   cycling. 4. Creating  Living  Landscapes:  enhancing  natural  processes  for  the  benefit  of  


people  and  wildlife  and  conserving  the  most  special  landscapes,  habitats  


and   species.  
 
5. Enhancing  Living  Space:  providing  a  range  of  outdoor  space  for  cultural,  

 


civic,   learning   and   community   activity,   including   productive   landscapes.  


11.3 Designated  open  spaces  include  Metropolitan  Open  Land  and  Local  Open  


Space  as  shown  on  the  Policies  map.  Metropolitan  Open  Land  will  be  protected  


from  inappropriate  development  by  applying  the  principles  of  national  Green  


Belt  policy  set  out  in  the  NPPF,  and  in  accordance  with  London  Plan  policy.  


Development  on  Local  Open  Space  and  playing  fields  is  not  permitted  unless  all  

 


criteria  in  section  C  of  the  policy  are  met.  Loss  of  other  open  space,  which  tends  

 


to  be  located  within  housing  estates,  will  also  be  carefully  managed  in  line  with  


criteria  D  of  the  policy  as  these  spaces  play  a  particularly  important  role  for  

 


those   without   access   to   private   gardens.  


11.4 Population  growth  and  development  pressures  in  Hackney  increases  the  


importance  of  protecting  all  existing  open  spaces  within  the  green  infrastructure  


network,  and  this  is  especially  important  in  areas  of  deficiency.  Map  4  below  

 
 
shows  areas  of  deficiency  in  access  to  publicly  accessible  open  space.  These  


areas  should  be  prioritised  for  on-site  provision  of  open  space  as  outlined  in  


Policy   LP48.

11.5 In  some  cases,  identified  areas  of  open  space  deficiency  are  not  always  a  result  

 
 
of  low  quantities  of  open  space,  but  a  lack  of  or  difficult  access  to  open  space.  

 


12
Enhancement  of  open  space,  particularly  improved  accessibility 
 to  existing  


parks  and  enhanced  links  between  existing  open  spaces  is  encouraged  across  

 
 
 
the  Borough  in  order  to  enhance  the  green  infrastructure  network  (refer  to  Policy  
 
  


LP49  Green  Chains  and  Green  Corridors).  The  provision  of  ancillary  facilities  


such  as  seating,  play  or  fitness  equipment,  public  toilets,  refreshment  facilities  


or  picnic  areas,  drinking  fountains  and  changing  facilities  of  an  appropriate  size  


and  scale  within  public  parks  and  other  publicly  accessible  open  spaces,  will  be  


supported   where   it  can   be   demonstrated   that   these   will   enhance   the   space.   
  
 
 
11.6 Living  roofs  and  vertical  forests  are  important  features  of  urban  greening,  


providing  various  benefits  including  improvements  in  the  visual  appearance  of  


buildings,  increased  biodiversity,  mitigation  and  adaptation  to  climate  change,  


and  reduction  in  air  and  noise  pollution.  Green  roofs  can  work  well  alongside  


and  even  enhance  the  performance  of  renewable  energy  technologies,  


particularly   solar   photovoltaic   systems,   for   example   by   regulating   temperature.  
 

 
 
11.7 There  are  nine  dedicated  allotment  sites  in  Hackney  managed  by  the  Hackney  


Allotment  Society  as  well  as  food  growing  spaces  led  by  independent  groups  


and  social  enterprises  are  also  found  in  other  open  spaces.  There  is  high  


demand  for  allotments  in  Hackney  and  the  Council  therefore  seeks  to  protect  all  


existing  sites  and  actively  supports  the  provision  of  new  allotments  and  the  


expansion  and  improvement  of  existing  allotments  and  community  food  growing  


schemes.  Allotments  and  community  gardens  provide  many  benefits  to  the  


physical  and  mental  wellbeing  of  residents  including  through  the  production  of  


healthy,  fresh  food,  greater  exposure  to  natural  environments  and  wildlife,  


physical  activity  and  social  connections.  New  food  growing  initiatives  are  


encouraged  on  existing  open  spaces  and  temporarily  derelict  land  where  short  


or  medium  term  development  is  not  planned.  Consideration  must  be  given  to  


facilities  such  as  storage  of  equipment  and  composting,  ensuring  that  there  is  

 
no  detrimental  impact  on  the  character,  appearance  and  amenity  of  the  


surrounding   area,   and   to   equality   of   access   and   security.  
 

## Lp47  Biodiversity  And  Sites  Of  Importance  Of  Nature Conservation

 
 
A. All  development  should  protect  and  where  possible  enhance  


biodiversity   leading   to   a   net   gain.  


B. All  development  should  maximise  opportunities  to  create  new  or  make  


improvements  to  existing  natural  environments,  nature  conservation  


areas,  habitats  or  biodiversity  features  and  link  into  the  wider  green  


infrastructure   network.  


C. All  major  development  proposals  are  required  to  include  a  biodiversity  

 
 
survey   of   the   site.  


D. All  development  schemes  involving  buildings  with  an  eaves  height  or  


roof  commencement  height  of  5  metres  and  above  are  required  to  


provide  nesting  boxes  for  swifts,  sparrows,  starlings  and/or  bats  as  


appropriate  to  help  preserve  endangered  urban  biodiversity  in  


Hackney.  
 

E. New  development  on  or  adjacent  to  Sites  of  Importance  for  Nature  


Conservation 
 (SINCs), 
 alongside 
 watercourses 
 and 
 wetlands,  


Walthamstow  Reservoirs  Special  Protection  Area  and  Walthamstow  


Marshes  Sites  of  Special  Scientific  Interest  (SSSI  -  in  neighbouring  

 
 
 
Waltham  Forest)  must  not  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the  


biodiversity  or  nature  conservation  value  of  the  site.  Development  will  


only  be  permitted  where  appropriate  mitigation  or  compensatory  


measures   are   put   in   place.   
  



11.8 There  are  24  designated  SINC  in  Hackney,  5  are  of  Metropolitan  Importance,  4  

 

 
of  Borough  Grade  1,  4  of  Borough  Grade  2  and  11  of  Local  Importance.  Parts  of  

 

 


Hackney  to  the  north  east  border  a  Special  Protection  Area  and  an  SSSI  in  

 


Waltham  Forest.  Springfield  Park,  in  addition  to  being  a  SINC,  is  designated  as 

 
  
 
 
a  Regionally  Important  Geological/Geomorphological  Site  (RIG)  based  on  its  


prominent  spring  line  and  Langley  Silt  and  Hackney  Gravel  composition,  and  will  


therefore   be   protected.  


11.9 Hackney  is  seeking  to  achieve  a  net  gain  in  biodiversity;  this  means  that  


development  should  leave  biodiversity  in  a  better  state  than  before.  Net  gain  

 


should  be  demonstrated  through  a  standanised  metric  such  as  the  BREEAM  

 


ecology  methodology  and  should  be  agreed  by  the  Council  at  the  


pre-application  stage.  All  development  proposals  should  retain,  enhance  or  


create  features  and  areas  of  nature  conservation  and/or  geodiversity  value  and  


avoid  harm  to  biodiversity.  Wildlife  corridors  should  be  provided  or  enhanced  


where  appropriate.  All  major  development  proposals  are  required  to  include  a  

 
biodiversity  survey  of  the  site  setting  out  actions  that  will  be  taken  to  protect  and  


enhance  the  biodiversity  value  on  the  site  and  the  methods  of  habitat  


management   that   will   be   implemented.   
  
 
 
11.10 All  development  schemes  where  buildings  have  an  eaves  height  or  roof  


commencement  height  of  5  metres  or  more  should  provide  nesting  boxes  for  

 


swifts,  sparrows,  starlings  and/or  bats  as  appropriate  to  help  preserve  


endangered  urban  biodiversity  in  Hackney.  Swift  bricks  should  be  set  flush  into  


the  external  wall  to  match  adjacent  brickwork  wherever  possible.  Reference  


should   be   made   to   the   Hackney   BAP   for   further   details:   
  
https://www.hackney.gov.uk/biodiversity#hackney   
  
 
 
11.11 Where  it  is  demonstrated  that  it  is  not  possible  to  avoid  adverse  impact  on  
  

 


habitats  and/or  species  and  there  are  exceptional  circumstances  such  as  


overriding  economic  or  social  reasons  for  a  development  to  occur  within  a  SINC,  

 

 
 
or  to  impact  on  a  SINC,  and  the  benefits  of  the  development  outweigh  the  


adverse  impact  on  the  biodiversity  and  geodiversity  value  of  the  site,  


development  proposals  must  follow  the  mitigation  hierarchy  set  out  in  the  draft  


London  Plan.  This  requires  that  1)  the  significant  ecological  features  of  the  site  


are  not  damaged,  2)  the  spatial  impact  is  minimised,  and  the  rest  of  the  site  


improved  or  better  managed  and  3)  biodiversity  compensation  off-site  is  


provided.  This  is  subject  to  reasonable  alternatives  for  location  and  design  


having   been   assessed.   
  

## Lp48  New  Open  Space

A. All  development  proposals  for  10  or  more  residential  units  must  


maximise   on-site   provision   of   open   space   and   where   feasible   provide:   
  
  i.  14   sqm   per   person   of   communal   open   space;   and   
  
ii.   An   Urban   Greening   Factor   score   of   at   least   0.4.  


B. All  major  mixed-use  or  commercial  development  must  maximise  on-site  


provision   of   open   space   and   where   feasible   provide:   
  
i.  4   sqm   of   communal   open   space   per   employee;   and  
 
ii.   An   Urban   Greening   Factor   score   of   at   least   0.3.  


C. Where   A   and   B   cannot   be   fully   achieved,   developments   must:   
  
i.  Make  physical  improvements  to  the  public  realm  to  improve  access  to  


existing   public    open   spaces,   and   
  
ii.  Make  financial  and/or  physical  contributions  towards  the  provision  of 


new  open  space,  the  enhancement  of  existing  public  open  space  or  


the  enhancement  of  other  green  infrastructure  and  biodiversity  in  the  


locality.   
  
 
 
D.  All   new   open   space   should   meet   the   following   criteria:  
 
i.  Be   provided   on   site   where   possible,   and  
 
ii.   Be   of   high   quality,   and  
 
iii.   Be   incorporated   into   the   design   of   the   scheme   from  the   outset,   and  
 
iv.   Maximise   biodiversity   benefits,   and  
 
v.   Be   publicly   accessible   and   usable   where   possible.   
  
 
 
11.12 Hackney's  projected  population  growth  means  there  is  a  requirement  for  


additional  open  space.  There  are  opportunities  for  provision  of  new  open  space  


within  new  residential  or  mixed-use  schemes  and  parts  A  and  B  of  this  policy  set  

 
  


out  the  required  levels  of  communal  open  space  within  major  development  


proposals.  The  figures  for  provision  of  new  communal  open  space  have  been  


calculated  based  on  Hackney's  average  existing  open  space  provision  and  the  


overarching  aim  to  retain  the  existing  levels  of  provision  per  person  as  the  


population  grows.  New  open  space  should  meet  the  criteria  set  out  in  part  D  of  

 
 
the   policy.   
  

 
 
11.13 In  addition  to  providing  communal  open  space,  applicants  are  required  to  


incorporate  urban  greening  measures  in  the  layout  and  design  of  a  scheme  to  

 
 
 
achieve  an  Urban  Green  Factor  score  of  at  least  0.4  for  major  residential  


schemes  and  at  least  0.3  for  major  mixed-use  or  commercial  schemes  in  line  


with  the  London  Plan.  This  will  help  to  increase  green  cover  across  each  


development  and  contribute  towards  the  aims  of  Policy  LP49  Green  chains  and  


Green   Corridors.   
  
 
 
11.14 In  the  areas  that  are  deficient  in  access  to  open  space,  shown  in  Map  4  (i.e.  

 
 
predominantly  around  Dalston  and  Shoreditch),  the  emphasis  is  on  on-site  


provision  of  open  space.  Any  financial  contributions  sought  will  be  in  line  with  


the  requirements  of  the  Community  Infrastructure  Levy  Regulations  (2010)  as  


amended.   
  

## Lp49  Green  Chains  And  Green  Corridors

 
 
A. All  new  development  adjacent  to  existing  Green  Chains  and  Green  


Corridors  must  be  developed  in  a  way  that  contributes  towards  the  

 


green  infrastructure  network.  In  the  areas  of  potential  new  Green  


Chains  identified  on  Map  5,  financial  contributions  may  be  sought  to  


develop   new   Green   Chains   in   the   future.  


11.15 Green  Chains  and  Green  Corridors  are  an  integral  part  of  Hackney's  green  


infrastructure  network,  contributing  positively  to  the  network  of  open  spaces,  


recreation  and  biodiversity  with  positive  impacts  on  climate  change,  drainage,  


air   quality,   active   travel   and   health.  


11.16 Green  Chains  connect  publicly  accessible  green  spaces  to  each  other  within  


Hackney's  boundaries  and  beyond.  Green  Chains  act  as  an  extension  of  the  


green  spaces  that  they  connect,  and  should  follow  the  ten  Healthy  Streets  


indicators .  


11.17 Green  Corridors  are  relatively  continuous  areas  of  open  space  leading  through  


the  built  environment,  which  may  be  linked  and  may  not  be  publicly  accessible.  


They  may  allow  animals  and  plants  to  be  found  further  into  the  built-up  area  


than  would  otherwise  be  the  case  and  provide  an  extension  to  the  habitats  of  


the   sites   they   join.  


11.18 Map  5  below  shows  the  existing  Green  Chains  and  Green  Corridors  and  


identified  areas  for  the  development  of  new  Green  Chains.  Contributions  


towards  new  and  existing  Green  Chains  and  Green  Corridors  will  be  informed  


by  details  in  the  Council's  Transport  Strategy  2015-2025  and  the  Council's  


Green   Infrastructure   Strategy.

## Lp50  Play  Space

A. The  Council  will  protect  existing  play  and  recreation  facilities  and  


support  the  development  of  new  formal  and  informal  play  facilities.  


New  major  residential  developments  and  mixed-use  schemes  that  are  


likely  to  generate  a  child  yield  of  10  or  more  are  required  to  provide  

 


10sqm   of   dedicated   play   space   per   child   on-site.  


B. New   play   spaces   should:  
 
i. Be  well  located  and  easily  accessible  by  pedestrian,  cycling  or  bus  


routes,   and  
 
ii. Be   inclusive   to   all,   and  
 
iii. Provide  a  range  of  different  types  of  play  facilities  and  experiences  
  


for   children   of   different   abilities,   and  
 
iv. Be   sustainable   and   easy   to   maintain.  


11.19 Children's  play  space  -  both  formal  and  informal  space  -  is  important  for  the  

 

 


development  of  physical,  social  and  emotional  skills  in  children  and  can  improve  

 


health  and  reduce  health  inequalities.  New  play  space  should  be  provided  on  


site  in  development  schemes  that  are  likely  to  generate  a  child  yield  of  10  or  

 


more.  Child  yield  should  be  established  using  the  play  space  calculator  in  the  


Mayor  of  London's  Play  and  Informal  Recreation  SPG  and  provision  should  be  


10sqm  per  child.  Play  space  must  be  inclusive  and  open  to  both  existing  


communities  and  new  residents.  New  play  spaces  and  areas  for  informal  


recreation  should  be  informed  by  the  design  principles  outlined  in  the  Mayor  of  


London's  Play   and   Informal   Recreation   SPG.   
  
 
 
11.20 If  site  constraints  mean  that  play  space  cannot  be  provided  in  addition  to  


communal  open  space  in  new  developments  as  outlined  in  Policy  LP48  then  


play  space  may  be  provided  on-site  within  communal  open  space  or  on  green  


roofs  where  these  areas  are  safe,  large  enough,  attractive  and  suitable  for  


children  to  play.  Exceptionally,  where  it  is  demonstrated  that  on-site  play  space  

  


is  not  feasible  in  any  form,  applicants  may  make  financial  and/or  physical  


contributions   for   the   enhancement   of   existing   play   space   in   the   locality.  

## Lp51  Tree  Management  And  Landscaping

A. All  development  proposals  must  retain  trees  of  amenity  value,  


especially  veteran  trees,  and  hedgerows  and  natural  features,  and  


must   incorporate   high   quality   landscaping.  


B. Proposals  resulting  in  the  removal  of  protected  trees  (trees  under  a  

 
Tree  Preservation  Order  (TPO)  and  those  within  Conservation  Areas)  


or  having  a  detrimental  impact  on  the  health  and  amenity  of  such  trees  
 
  


will  be  refused  except  where  overriding  ecological  benefits  and/or  


wider 
 planning 
 benefits 
 are 
 demonstrated. 
 In 
 such 
 cases,  


compensatory  measures  will  be  required  for  suitable  replacements  


and/or  additional  planting,  or  contributions  to  planting  offsite.  The  


removal  of  non-protected  trees  as  part  of  development  schemes  will  


not  be  supported  unless  adequate  replacement  planting  is  proposed,  

 
 
or   the   removal   is   in   the   interests   of   good   arboricultural   practice.  


11.21 Trees  are  a  valuable  feature  of  the  urban  and  natural  landscape  and  a  key  part  
 
  

 
 
 
of  the  green  infrastructure  network.  Trees  offer  substantial  benefits  to  people  


and  the  environment  in  improving  air  quality,  reducing  noise  pollution,  


contributing  to  climate  change  adaptation,  reducing  the  urban  heat  island  effect,  


providing  habitats  for  wildlife,  contributing  towards  biodiversity  and  providing  


landscape  structure  and  character.  Street  trees  in  particular  contribute  to  the  


visual  quality  and  amenity  of  the  public  realm  and  help  people  relate  to  the  


urban   environment.  


11.22 Trees  and  landscaping  should  be  an  integral  part  of  the  design  process.  All  


development  proposals  must  retain  and  protect  existing  trees  of  amenity  value,  


i.e.  those  that  have  interest  biologically,  aesthetically  or  culturally.  For  


non-protected  trees,  the  considerations  for  replacement  trees,  if  required,  are  

 
 
 
established  through  surveys  in  accordance  with  BS5837  (British  Standard  for  


Trees).  The  Council  will  work  out  the  value  of  an  existing  tree  through  CAVAT,  


i-tree  or  other  appropriate  valuation  systems,  in  order  to  establish  what  is  the  


appropriate   level   of   replacement   in   accordance   with   the   London   Plan.   
  
 
 
11.23 In  addition,  Landscaping  Plans  must  be  submitted  with  all  major  development  


proposals  demonstrating  that  landscape  design  and  materials  are  of  a  high  


quality  and  compatible  with  the  character  of  the  area,  proposed  planting  is  


environmentally  appropriate  for  the  specific  location,  proposed  sustainable  


irrigation  plans  are  appropriate,  and  that  planting  design  will  not  impact  


negatively  on  the  structure  of  nearby  buildings  or  hinder  accessibility.  


Opportunities  for  food  growing  should  also  be  considered  as  part  of  landscaping  


schemes.  The  emphasis  is  to  soften  the  impact  of  the  development  in  its  setting,  

 

 
 
 
provide  visual  interest  in  the  street  scene  and  contribute  to  nature  conservation  


and   the   Borough's  green   infrastructure.  
 

## Lp52  Water  Spaces,  Canals  And  Residential  Moorings

A. New  development  adjacent  to  water  spaces  and  riparian  areas  must  


protect  and  where  appropriate  enhance  the  natural  habitats  and  the  


setting   of   the   water   space. Development   Alongside   Water   spaces   and   Canals  
 
B. Development  alongside  water  spaces  and  riparian  areas  will  be  


permitted   where   all   of   the   following   criteria   are   met:  
 
i. Public  access  in  the  form  of  a  continuous  green  chain  along  the  


waterfront  or  towpath  is  maintained,  created  or  enhanced.  This  


should  include,  where  appropriate,  the  incorporation  of  an  


undeveloped   buffer   strip   alongside   the   watercourse;   and  
 
ii. There  is  no  conflict  with  nature  conservation,  biodiversity  interest,  


heritage  value  or  flood  risk  management.  Mitigation  or  compensatory  


measures   may   be   necessary;   and   
  
iii. The  development  enhances  the  leisure,  recreation  or  educational  


value   of   the   water   space;   and  
 
iv. The  development  does  not  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  structural  


integrity   of    the   waterspace   ;   and  
 
v. The  development  does  not  cause  additional  overshadowing  of  a  


canal.  A  daylight  and  sunlight  assessment  must  be  submitted  with  all  
  


applications  and  mitigation  or  compensatory  measures  may  be  


necessary;   and   
  
vi. The  design  makes  a  positive  contribution  to  the  character  and  


appearance   of   the   waterfront   area   and   setting.   
  

## Residential   Moorings

C.  Proposals  for  residential  moorings  will  be  supported,  provided  


supporting  uses  and  facilities  are  or  will  be  in  place,  and,  where  


appropriate  they  have  regard  to  the  Park  Plan  and  Area  Proposals  of  


the   Lee   Valley   Park   Authority.   
  

D.  Proposals   for   residential   moorings   and   associated   facilities   must   not:   
  

i. Hinder   navigation   along   the   waterway;   or  
 
ii. Have  a  detrimental  impact  on  nature  conservation  and  biodiversity;  
  


or  
 
iii. Impede   public   access;   or  
 
iv. Detrimentally  affect  leisure  provision,  amenity  and  the  character  and  


appearance   of   the   waterway   and   surrounding   area.  


11.24 The  most  significant  waterways  in  Hackney,  all  of  which  are  designated  under  


the   Water   Framework   Directive,   are:  


●
The   Old   River   Lea   and   Lee   Navigation   (Hackney   Cut)  
 
●
Regents   Canal   (including   Wenlock   and   Kingsland   basins)  
 
●
The   New   River,   West   and   East   Reservoirs   (Stoke   Newington)  


11.25 The  water  spaces  in  Hackney  include  rivers,  canals,  reservoirs  and  ponds.  The  


majority  of  these  form  part  of  the  strategic  Blue  Ribbon  Network  and  are  


recognised  as  a  valuable  habitat  for  plants  and  nature  conservation  and  provide  
 
  


for  a  range  of  leisure  interests.  Development  along  the  water  spaces  is  


permitted  provided  all  criteria  in  part  B  of  the  policy  are  met.  Development  


alongside  water  spaces  can  impact  on  biodiversity  as  a  result  of  light  spill,  


reduced  natural  light  and  cooler  temperatures,  and  can  potentially  also  create  a  

 
'canyoning'  effect,  reducing  its  amenity  value.  The  Sustainable  Design  and  


Construction  SPD  (2016)  provides  further  guidance  on  protecting  biodiversity  


along  Hackney's  waterways.  All  canalside  developments  must  therefore  be  


accompanied  by  a  daylight  and  sunlight  assessment  that  identifies  the  


waterspace  as  a  sensitive  receptor  and  sets  out  the  mitigation  measures  that  
 
  


will  be  implemented  if  a  development  is  likely  to  cause  additional  overshadowing  

  
  


of  the  canal.  The  undeveloped  buffer  strip  alongside  a  watercourse  should  be  

 


publicly  accessible.  Any  proposals  must  take  account  of  the  statutory  and  


discretionary  requirements  of  the  Environment  Agency,  the  Canal  and  River  

Trust  and  Natural  England  and  must  support  the  aims  of  the  European  Union  


Water  Framework  Directive  which  seeks  to  achieve  Good  Ecological  Status  or  


Potential  across  Hackney's  waterways.  Development  alongside  the  waterways  


should   also   consider   using   waterborne   freight.  


11.26 There  is  demand  in  Hackney  for  both  permanent  private  moorings  and  moorings  
  
  


that  are  open  to  all  licensed  craft  (for  up  to  2  weeks,  unless  otherwise  specified  

 


by  local  restrictions).  In  line  with  the  London  Plan,  Hackney  supports  residential  


moorings  along  the  navigation  systems  provided  all  the  criteria  of  Part  D  of  the  

 
 
 
policy  are  met  and  there  is  no  detrimental  impact  on  the  waterways.  Permanent  

 


moorings  in  particular  should  be  located  if  possible  off-line  from  the  main  


navigation  routes,  i.e.  in  basins  and  docks,  lay-bys,  or  on  the  non-towing  path  


side  of  the  waterway.  If  planning  permission  for  mooring  is  granted,  applicants  

 

 
 
 
would  also  be  required  to  obtain  permission  from  the  Canal  &  River  Trust  for  

 


permission   to   moor   on   the   waterspace.  
 

## 12. Protecting   The  Environment   And Responding   To    Climate   Change

 
 
12.1 Hackney  must  balance  planning  for  growth  with  ensuring  that  there  is  protection  

 
 
for  the  environment  and  an  appropriate  response  to  the  challenges  of  climate  


change.  The  policies  in  this  chapter  seek  to  deliver  a  reduction  in  carbon  


emissions  and  pollution,  a  greater  use  of  sustainable  construction  techniques,  

 


and   effective   water   and   waste   management.   
  
 
 
12.2 Hackney's  approach  to  climate  change  is  two  fold.  Firstly,  through  Policies  LP53  

 


Water  and  Flooding  and  LP54  Overheating  and  Adapting  to  Climate  Change,  


the  Council  requirements  to  build-in  resilience  and  prepare  for  the  expected  


changes  to  the  environment  that  will  occur  through  climate  change.  Secondly,  


Policies  LP55  -  LP56  set  out  the  Council's  approach  to  mitigating  climate  
 
  


change.  

## Key  Facts:

●
Hackney's  per  capita  carbon  dioxide  emissions  are  amongst  the  lowest  in  


the  country,  declining  from  4.2  tonnes  in  2005  to  3.4  tonnes  in  2013.  These  

 

 
 
 
low  emissions  may  be  due  to  the  absence  of  heavy  industry  in  the  area,  


but   homes   are   responsible   for   almost   half   of   all   emissions   in   Hackney.  
 
●
The  proportion  of  household  waste  recycled  has  gone  up  from  1%  in  2001  

 
 
to   25%   today.  
 
●
In  addition  to  potential  flood  risk  from  rivers  and  canals,  there  are  areas  in  

 
the   Borough   that   are   vulnerable   to   surface   water   flooding.  
 

## Chapter  Objectives:

●
To  become  a  low  carbon  and  carbon  resilient  borough  with  significant  


improvements  to  air  quality  and  a  reduction  in  the  urban  heat  island  effect  

 


within   the   Borough.  

 

## Lp53  Water  And  Flooding

A. All  development  must  have  regard  to  reducing  flood  risk,  both  to,  and  


from  the  site,  over  its  expected  lifetime.  Potentially  vulnerable  


development  must  not  be  located  in  flood-prone  areas  as  identified  by  


the  Council  unless  it  can  be  suitably  demonstrated  that  flood-risk  will  

 


be  sufficiently  mitigated  using  flood  resistance  and/or  resilience  


measures.  


B. All  development  should  decrease  vulnerability  to  flooding  through  


appropriate   siting,   design,   and   on-,   and   off-site   mitigation.  


C. The  following  types  of  development  will  be  expected  to  submit  the  


appropriate   flood   risk   assessment:  
 
i.  Developments  in  fluvial  flood  zone  2  or  3  including  minor  


development   and   change   of   use;  
 
ii.   Developments   on   sites   of   1   hectare   (ha)   or   more   in   flood   zone   1;  
 
iii.  Developments  on  sites  of  less  than  1  hectare  in  flood  zone  1,  


including  change  of  use  in  development  type  to  a  more  vulnerable  

 
 
 
class  (for  example  from  commercial  to  residential),  where  they  could  


be  affected  by  sources  of  flooding  other  than  rivers  and  the  sea  (for  


example   surface   water   drains,   reservoirs);  
 
iv.  All  major  developments  or  basement  developments  in  areas  with  a  

 
high  risk  of  surface  water  flooding,  or  in  an  area  known  to  have  a  

 
potentially   elevated   risk   of   groundwater   flooding   in   flood   zone   1;  
 
v.   All   development   in   flood   zone   1   located   in   a   critical   drainage   area  


D. All  major  developments  will  be  required  to  submit  a  Sustainable  


Drainage  Strategy  taking  into  account  climate  change  allowances  and  


supported  by  a  site-specific  management  and  maintenance  plan  of  the  
 
  


drainage  proposal.  All  other  developments,  particularly  for  sites  


located  within  critical  drainage  areas,  should  implement  Sustainable  


Drainage  Systems  (SuDS)  such  as  water  butt,  green/blue  roof,  


permeable   paving   and   other   above   ground   green   infrastructures.   
  

E. Development  which  includes  the  creation  or  extension  of  basements  


must  demonstrate  that  they  will  not  increase  the  potential  for  

groundwater   flooding   to   itself   or   to   the   surrounding   area.  
 


F. All  developments  should  achieve  greenfield  runoff  rates  by  attenuating  


rainwater  on  site,  utilising  SuDS  and  in  accordance  with  the  London  


Plan  drainage  hierarchy.  Where  this  is  shown,  through  appropriate  


evidence,  to  be  unfeasible,  planning  obligations  will  be  expected  to  


reduce   the   overall   flood   risk   within   the   site   and   in   the   vicinity.  


G. All  development  should,  in  liaison  with  Thames  Water,  take  account  of  


the  capacity  of  existing  on  and  off-site  water  and  sewerage  


infrastructure  and  the  impact  of  development  proposals  on  this  


infrastructure.  All  major  developments  will  be  required  to  demonstrate  


that  capacity  exists  on  and  off-site  in  the  sewerage  network  to  serve  


the  development  or  that  it  can  be  provided  ahead  of  occupation  to  

 


ensure  there  is  sufficient  capacity  in  the  sewerage  system  to  


accommodate   for   the   proposed   flows.  

H. Where  necessary,  and  as  advised  by  Thames  Water,  the  Council  will  


seek  improvements  to  water  and/or  sewerage  infrastructure  related  


and  appropriate  to  the  development  so  that  improvements  are  


completed   prior   to   occupation   of   development.  


I.
All  developments  should  take  account  of  the  location,  capacity  and  


requirements  of,  and  access  to,  existing,  and  need  for  improved,  flood  


defences,   and   where   needed   supporting   improvements.  


J. Development  must  be  designed  to  be  water  efficient  and  reduce  water  


consumption.  Non-domestic  development  and  refurbishment  will  be  


expected  to  meet  the  BREEAM  excellent  standard  and,  where  


possible,  the  maximum  BREEAM  water-efficiency  credits.  Residential  


development  must  not  exceed  a  maximum  water  use  of  105  litres  per  

 


head  per  day  (excluding  the  allowance  of  up  to  5  litres  for  external  

 


water   consumption).  


K. New  developments  are  encouraged  to  incorporate  additional  water  


saving,  water  recycling  and  water  efficiency  measures  such  as  


smart-metering,  rainwater  harvesting,  greywater  recycling,  including  


retrofitting,   to   help   reduce   water   consumption.   
  


12.3 Hackney  is  a  highly  urbanised  borough  which  is  subject  to  risks  from  flooding,  
 
  


both  from  the  River  Lea  to  the  east  of  the  Borough  and  local  surface  water  


flooding.  These  risks  are  exacerbated  by  the  impact  of  climate  change,  which  


will   lead   to   increased   rainfall   intensity   and   frequency.  
 

 
 
12.4 The  Climate  Change  Allowances  were  updated  in  the  Planning  Practice  


Guidance  in  2016.  The  new  allowances  show  a  greater  effect  on  anticipated  

 


peak  river  flows,  and  by  association  the  increased  risk  of  fluvial  flooding,  due  to  


climate  change  in  the  Thames  Basin  in  the  future.  Most  of  Hackney  is  in  Flood  

 
 
 
Zone  1,  which  means  that  it  is  at  low  risk  of  fluvial  flooding.  Hackney  Wick  is  the  

  

 
 
area  most  affected  by  fluvial  flooding  and  is  a  Level  3  Flood  Zone.  The  impact  of  

  
  


increased  fluvial  flooding  due  to  climate  change  will  be  greatest  on  the  areas  of  


Hackney  already  at  higher  risk  of  flooding.  In  Hackney,  a  sequential  and  


risk-based  approach  has  been  applied  to  steer  new  development  to  areas  with  a  

 
low   probability   of   flooding.   
   
 
 
12.5 Surface  water  flooding  tends  to  have  a  greater  impact  on  the  urbanised  


environment  due  to  runoff  from  impermeable  and  made  surfaces.  These  risks  


are  exacerbated  by  the  impact  of  climate  change,  which  will  lead  to  increased  


rainfall  intensity  and  frequency.  Surface  water  management  is  therefore  


essential  to  ensure  that  any  new  developments  will  not  increase  the  risk  of  


flooding  on  and  offsite.  Redeveloped  sites  will  also  provide  further  opportunities  


to  better  manage  surface  water  and  retrofit  systems  to  improve  drainage  in  


existing   sites.   
  
 
 
12.6 Groundwater  flood  risk  is  often  highly  localised  and  dependent  upon  geological  

 


interfaces  between  permeable  and  impermeable  subsoils.  It  is  therefore 


essential  that  an  understanding  of  site  specific  ground  conditions  is  achieved  


through  site  survey  and/or  review  of  detailed  borehole  data  before  the  creation  


and/or  extension  of  basements.  Groundwater  flooding  mitigation  can  be  


achieved  in  basements  through  the  use  of  an  appropriate  pumped  device  and  


non-return  valve  which  would  protect  the  site  from  potential  flooding/backup  


from  the   sewerage   system.   
  
 
 
12.7 Where  necessary,  and  as  advised  by  Thames  Water,  the  Council  will  use  


phasing  conditions  to  ensure  any  necessary  improvements  to  water  and/or  


sewerage  infrastructure  required  as  a  result  of  development  is  completed  prior  

 

 
 
 
to  occupation  of  the  relevant  phase  of  development.  Developers  are  


encouraged  to  discuss  their  proposals  with  Thames  Water  prior  to  the  


submission   of   any   application.  


12.8 London  as  a  whole  is  under  water  stress.  The  impact  of  climate  change,  and  
 
  


associated  longer  hotter  summers,  and  growing  numbers  of  residents  will  add  to  


this  problem. 
 An  important  aspect  of  mitigating  against  potential  water  


shortages  is  by  using  water  as  efficiently  as  possible.  This  can  be  achieved  


through  any  measures  that  enable  a  decreased  use  of  water,  from  using  drought  

 


tolerant   plants   in   landscaping   design   to   retaining   and   reusing   grey   water   on   site.  
 

## Lp54  Overheating  And  Adapting  To  Climate  Change

A. All  new  development  must  regulate  internal  and  external  temperatures  


through  orientation,  design,  materials  and  technologies  which  avoid  


overheating,  mitigate  the  Urban  Heat  Island  (UHI)  effect  and  have  


regard  to  maximising  the  use  of  the  cooling  hierarchy.  Measures  which  


deliver   biodiversity   benefits   will   be   strongly   supported.   
  
12.9 Climate  Change  is  increasing  temperatures  across  the  South  of  England  and  


this  is  likely  to  continue  over  the  next  century.  As  an  inner  London  borough,  


Hackney  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  these  temperature  changes  due  to  the  


Urban  Heat  island  effect,  in  which  buildings,  roads  and  other  man-made  


structures  retain  significant  amounts  of  heat  and  lead  to  elevated  temperatures  


up  to  8 o C  warmer  than  the  green  belt  around  London.  Applications  for  major  


developments  should  include  an  overheating  risk  analysis  as  part  of  the  


submission  of  Energy  Assessment.  Guidance  on  the  methodology  and  


requirements  are  indicated  in  the  GLA  report  'Energy  Assessment  Guidance  on  


preparing  energy  assessments  as  part  of  the  planning  applications'.  Developers  


should  incorporate  measures  that  address  overheating  and  increase  biodiversity  


in   accordance   with   Policies   LP46   and   LP47.  


12.10 The  overheating  policy  aims  to  ensure  the  design  of  buildings  take  account  of  


ways  to  reduce  their  contribution  to  the  urban  heat  island  effect,  are  low  carbon  


and  remain  comfortable  to  the  occupants.  This  can  be  achieved  through  


external  measures,  such  as  tree  planting  and  green  roofs  to  increase  shade  and  


regulate  temperatures  through  evapotranspiration,  and  adopting  the  London  


Plan  cooling  hierarchy  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  overheating  and  the  reliance  on  


active  cooling  systems.  Passive  cooling  strategies,  to  prevent  heat  gains  and  to  


dissipate  indoor  heat,  for  example  internal  design  to  increase  natural  ventilation  


and  temperature  control,  shading  and  solar  control  glazing,  are  therefore  


recommended.  

## Lp55  Mitigating  Climate  Change

A. All  new  developments  in  Hackney  must  actively  seek  to  mitigate  the  


impact  of  climate  change  through  design  which  minimises  exposure  


to   the   effects,   and   technologies   which   maximise   sustainability.  


B. All  new  residential  development  should  meet  a  zero  carbon  emissions  

 


target  emission  rate  in  line  with  the  London  Plan  energy  hierarchy  


and   Sustainability   and   the   Built   Environment   SPD.  


C. All  non-residential  developments  must  achieve  the  BREEAM  


'Excellent'  rating  (or  an  equivalent  rating  under  any  other  system  


which  may  replace  it)  and  where  possible  achieve  the  maximum  


number   of   water   credits,   and   must   be   built   to   be   zero-carbon.   
  
 
 
D. In  reducing  carbon  emissions,  residential  development  should  aim  to  


achieve  10%  and  non-residential  development  should  aim  to  achieve  


15%   through   energy   efficiency   measures   alone.  


E. Major  commercial  development  should  generate  at  least  10%  of  their  


energy  needs  from  renewable  sources  onsite  or  in  the  local  area,  


where  this  is  consistent  with  the  London  Plan  energy  hierarchy  and  


energy   infrastructure   policies.  


F. The  design,  construction  and  operation  of  new  buildings  should  be  


informed   by   the   London   Plan   energy   hierarchy.   
  
 
 
G. Where  it  can  be  robustly  demonstrated  that  it  is  not  possible  to  


reduce  CO 2  emissions  on-site  by  the  specified  levels,  carbon  


off-setting  payments  will  be  required  and  secured  via  legal  


agreement.  
 

## Existing   Developments

H. Development  including  the  re-use  or  extension  of  existing  buildings  


should  achieve  the  maximum  feasible  reductions  in  carbon  emissions  

 
 
 
and  support  in  achieving  the  strategic  carbon  reductions  target  in  the  


London  Plan,  while  protecting,  heritage  and  character  of  the  


buildings.  Development  should  consider  synergies  with  new  build  


elements  on  sites  and  developments  should  seek  to  achieve  the  


zero-carbon   target   across   the   site.  
 

12.11 Hackney  is  committed  to  contributing  to  reducing  carbon  emissions  from  the  


Borough  by  80%  by  2050,  and  the  Council  is  a  signatory  to  UK100,  which  binds  

  


it  to  making  use  of  100%  clean  energy  across  its  functions  by  2050.  This  is  


aimed  at  mitigating  the  impact  of  climate  change  in  order  to  limit  its  impacts  


globally,  and  through  local  intervention  to  ensure  buildings  are  resilient  to  its  


impacts.  


12.12 All  residential  developments  must  demonstrate  how  they  meet  zero-carbon  


standards  and  mitigate  climate  change,  including  smaller  developments.  


Non-Residential  developments  will  be  required  to  meet  these  standards  by  


2019.  The  Sustainable  Design  and  Construction  SPD  provides  guidance  on  


achieving  these  aims.  Where  developments  cannot  meet  these  requirements  on  


site,  they  will  be  required  to  provide  off-site  contributions  which  will  be  used  by  


the  council  to  deliver  equivalent  off-setting.  Major  developments  must  produce  


an  energy  assessment,  detailing  carbon  emission  targets  that  have  been  


reached,  and  any  shortfalls.  Guidance  is  given  in  the  GLA  report  'Energy  


Assessment  Guidance:  Greater  London  Authority  guidance  on  preparing  energy  


assessments   as   part   of   planning   applications'.   
  
 
 
12.13 The  vast  majority  of  Hackney's  built  environment  which  will  exist  in  2100  is  


already  standing,  and  makes  significant  contributions  to  carbon  emissions.  It  is  

 
critical  that  when  these  buildings  are  re-used  or  extended,  intervention  is  made  

 
 
to  ensure  the  resulting  developments  are  brought  up  to  a  modern  standard  and  

 


contribute  to  borough  wide  contributions  to  carbon  reduction.  Retrofitting  of  


existing  technologies  should  be  completed  in  such  a  way  that  the  original  


character   of   buildings   is   undamaged,   and   where   possible,   enhanced.  

## Lp56  Decentralised  Energy  Networks  (Den)


A. All  developments  should  maximise  opportunities  to  incorporate  


decentralised  energy  to  support  reductions  in  energy  use  and  


emissions. B. New  major  development  should  connect  to  an  existing  network;  unless  


it  is  clearly  demonstrated  that  it  is  not  technically  feasible  or  


economically   viable.   
  
 
 
C. Only  when  it  can  be  clearly  demonstrated  that  all  options  to  link  into  
 
  


existing  schemes  have  been  explored  should  development  provide  


on-site  DEN.  Developments  should  be  designed  to  connect  to  other  


developments   at   a   later   date. D. Where  there  is  a  planned  DEN  within  feasible  and  viable  range  of  


future  connection,  proposed  major  developments  should  be  designed  


to   connect   to   that   network.  
 
12.14 Decentralised  energy  can  play  a  significant  role  in  both  reducing  carbon  


emissions  by  eliminating  power  lost  in  transmission  over  the  national  grid,  and  in  

 

 
building  the  resilience  of  developments  in  the  Borough  by  reducing  reliance  on  


this  grid.  A  key  challenge  with  these  schemes  is  the  strategic  connection  of  new  

 


developments  into  existing  networks  to  increase  efficiency  and  viability.  In  order 


to  enable  this,  new  developments  must  clearly  demonstrate  how  they  explore  


options  to  connect,  where  viable  to  existing  schemes.  The  Council  is  also  


developing  a  Decentralised  Energy  Masterplan  to  support  delivery  of  the  policy  
  


and   support   development   decisions.   
  

## Lp57  Waste

 
 
A.
Developments  should  seek  to  minimise  waste  during  both  construction 


and  operation  of  the  development,  and  should  provide  clear  details  in  


plans  for  the  facilities  needed  for  the  storage  and  collection  of  waste  


and   recycling. B.
Proposals  for  new  waste  facilities  and  for  the  development  of  existing  


waste  sites  should  comply  with  the  policies  in  the  North  London  Waste  

 


Plan   (NLWP).   
  


12.15 Hackney  is  part  of  the  North  London  Waste  Authority,  which  is  a  cross-borough  
  

  
 
group  coordinating  how  to  deal  with  waste  and  refuse  disposal.  In  addition  to  


this  Hackney,  in  partnership  with  six  other  north  London  boroughs,  has  prepared  
 
  


the  NLWP  to  set  out  the  planning  framework  for  waste  management  in  the  North  

 
 
 
London  boroughs  for  the  next  15  years.  Policy  LP57  which  primarily  provides  


the  policy  context  for  the  storage  and  collection  of  waste  within  new  


development  should  be  read  alongside  the  NLWP  which  identifies  sites  for  


waste  management  use  and  sets  out  policies  for  determining  waste  planning  


applications.  
 

## Lp58  Improving  The  Environment  -  Pollution Air   Pollution

A. All  new  development  must  as  a  minimum  not  exceed  air  quality  neutral  

 


standards  or  contribute  to  a  worsening  of  air  quality  at  the  construction  

 


or   operation   stage,   over   the   lifetime   of   the   development.   
  
  
  

B. New  development,  especially  those  catering  for  vulnerable  people  and  


users  such  as  elderly  and  children  should  be  sited  and  designed  to  


minimise   exposure   to   air   pollution.  

C. An  air  quality  assessment  (AQA)  will  be  required  for  the  following  


types   of   development:   
  
●All   major   developments,   or  
 
●New   build   developments   in   areas   of   sub-standard   air   quality;   or  
 
●Developments   in   close   proximity   to   sensitive   uses;   or  
 
●Development   of   sensitive   uses;   or  
 
●Developments   which   involve   significant   demolition   and    construction.   
  
 
 
D. Development  proposals  which  are  identified  as  likely  to  cause  harm  to  


air  quality  or  could  expose  occupiers  and  users  of  the  building  to  poor  


air  quality  will  be  resisted  unless  appropriate  mitigation  measures  are  


proposed   to   reduce   the   impact   to   acceptable   levels.   
  
 
 
E. Measures  to  improve  air  quality  should  be  implemented  on-site  


however  where  it  can  be  demonstrated  that  on-site  provision  is  


impractical  or  inappropriate,  off-site  measures  to  improve  local  air  


quality  may  be  acceptable,  provided  that  equivalent  air  quality  benefits  


can   be   demonstrated.  

## Water   Pollution

F. New  developments  should  not  pose  an  unacceptable  risk  to  water  


quality  and  developments  which  have  the  potential  to  adversely  impact  


on  water  quality,  in  the  opinion  of  Hackney  and  the  Environment  


Agency,  will  be  required  to  provide  appropriate  mitigation  to  alleviate  


the   risk.  
 
G. Source  Protection  Zones  (SPZs)  should  be  taken  into  account  when  


considering   the   environmental   impact   of   a   development.   
  

## Contaminated   Land

H. For 
 development 
 proposed 
 on 
 contaminated 
 or 
 potentially  


contaminated  land,  a  desk  study  and  site  investigation  in  line  with  the  
 
  


most  up-to-date  guidance  will  be  required  and  remediation  proposals  


agreed   to   deal   with   any   identified   contamination.   
  
 
 
I.
New  development  should  address  risks  to  sensitive  receptors  (both  on  


and  off  site)  from  land  contamination  through  proportionate  action(s)  


before 
 and  during  construction  and  during  operation  where  


appropriate,   planning   conditions,   over   the   lifetime   of   the   development.   
  
 
 
J. Development  which  proposes  potentially  contaminating  or  polluting  


activities,  or  which  is  located  in  close  proximity  to  hazardous  


installations,  must  incorporate  mitigation  for  harmful  effects  to  people  


and  the  environment  and  where  considered  necessary,  provide  


monitoring   of   any   impact.  
 

## Noise   And   Vibration

K. Noise-sensitive  development  should  be  located  in  areas  where  


occupiers  will  not  be  exposed  to  significantly  adverse  noise  levels.  


Where  new  noise-sensitive  development  is  proposed  in  proximity  to  


existing  noise-generating  uses,  the  applicant  will  be  required  to  carry  


out  a  noise  assessment  and  demonstrate  how  adverse  effects  will  be  
  


effectively  mitigated  without  harming  the  continued  operation  of  


existing   uses.   
  
 
 
L. Development  in  any  location  will  only  be  permitted  where  it  can  be  

 
 
 
demonstrated  that  the  noise  generated  by  the  development  is  


effectively  mitigated  to  prevent  adverse  impacts  on  health  and  quality  


of  life.  The  impact  of  noise  generated  by  the  demolition  and  


constructions   phases   of   development   must   also   be   minimized.   
  
 
 
M. All  residential  development  proposals  shall  minimise  the  potential  


adverse  noise  impact  on  and  between  dwellings  through  housing  


layout,  design  and  materials.  New  development  will  only  be  permitted  


where   the   locations   of   lift  and   circulation    mitigate   the   impact.  
 


12.16 Hackney  is  an  inner-city  area  of  London  with  high  population  densities  and  


commensurate  issues  with  pollution. 
 LP33  seeks  to  ensure  that  planning  


supports  broader  council  objectives  to  promote  the  health  and  wellbeing  of  


individuals.  


12.17 The  policies  aim  to  ensure  developments  do  not  contribute  to  a  worsening  of  air  

 


quality,  with  particular  regard  to  sensitive  uses,  such  as  schools  and  homes.  It  


also  seeks  to  ensure  that  water  sources  are  not  damaged  by  development,  and  


that  the  potential  for  contaminated  land  on  sites  is  investigated,  and  where  


needed,  appropriately  mitigated. 
 Finally,  it  seeks  to  ensure  that  new  


developments  do  not  expose  users  to  damaging  noise  levels  through  the  


location  and  design  of  new  development.  It  also  ensures  that  development  


which  results  in  the  creation  of  new  noise  sources  do  not  affect  existing  


developments,   and   where   this   is   the   case,   provide   appropriate   mitigation.  


12.18 There  are  9  Air  quality  focus  areas  in  Hackney.  These  are  areas  of  sub-standard  
 
  

 


air  quality.  When  development  proposals  within  these  areas  are  assessed,  this  


status  will  be  taken  into  account  as  they  are  locations  with  existing  high  human  


exposure  to  nitrogen  dioxide  (NO2).  These  areas  are:  Manor  House  


junction/Green 
 Lane/Seven 
 Sisters 
 Road; 
 Stamford  Hill/Amhurst  Park  


Road/Stamford  Hill  Road;  Seven  Sisters  Road  at  Finsbury  Park;  Clapton  Road  


Junction  Lea  Bridge  Road;  Stoke  Newington  High  Street/Stamford  Hill  /  Rectory  

 
 
Road;  Dalston  Junction/Balls  Pond  Road/Kingsland  High  Road;  Hackney  


Wick/Homerton  High  Street/Wick  Road/Cassland  Road/Victoria  Park  Road;  


Hackney  Central/Amhurst  Road/Dalston  Lane/Mare  Street;  Old  Street/City  


Road/Old   Street/Great   Eastern   St/Shoreditch   High   Street.  
 
  

## 13.Site   Allocations

13.1 The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  identify  and  allocate  key  strategic  development  

 


sites  in  the  Borough.  These  policies  provide  site-specific  development  guidance  


and  allocate  particular  uses  for  those  sites  during  the  15  year  plan  period;  in  the 

 
 
'short  term'  (0-5  yrs),  'medium  term'  (6-10  yrs)  and  'long  term'  (11-15  yrs).  The  


sites  allocated  in  this  section,  along  with  other  sites  including  permissions  not  


yet  implemented  (pipeline),  estate  regeneration  schemes  and  sites  in  the  


Shoreditch  and  Stamford  Hill  AAP  areas  will  support  the  delivery  of  this  Plan.  


Further   information   is   set   out   in   Chapter   14   Implementation   and   Monitoring.

 How   was   the  site   identified?  
 
This  large  estate  is  part  of  the  Council's  Estate  Regeneration  Programme  and  


was   allocated   in   the   Sites   Allocation   Local   Plan   (2016).   
  
Timescale:    Short,   Medium,   Long   Terms  

  

## Policy   Mh1 Allocation:

Residential  and  supporting  uses  including  retail,  employment, 


education,   other   community   and   leisure   facilities.  
 

## Development   Principles:

●
A  Robust  Urban  Design  Framework  -  Improving  the  quality  of  the  

 


surroundings,  including  amenity,  views,  ecology  and  character,  


which  can  benefit  existing  and  future  residents.  Improving  


connections  through  the  site  to  link  the  Northern  and  Southern  side  


of  Seven  Sisters  Road  and  extend  the  relationship  to  landscape  


context   including   the   New   River,   the   Reservoirs   and   Finsbury   Park.   
  
●
Transform  Community  Facilities  -  Provide  new  retail  and  community  

 


uses  including  affordable  workspace  and  flexible  space  to  allow  for  


facilities  to  come  forward  to  meet  the  needs  of  existing  and  future  


residents.    
●
Efficient  Public  Transport  - Improve  the  footpath  and  cycle  network  


in  accordance  with  TfL's  Healthy  Street  Indicators.  Improve  public  


transport  facilities  to  integrate  with  Manor  House  underground  


station   and   future   Crossrail   2   links.  
 
●
Streets  that  Put  People  First  -  Introduce  attractive  landscaping,  

 


parks  and  safe  pedestrian  crossings  and  improved  cycling  and  


pedestrian  routes.  Minimise  on  street  and  off  street  car  parking.  


Reduce  the  dominance  of  Seven  Sisters  Road  to  make  it  an  


attractive   landscaped   street.   
  
●
Homes  for  a  Diverse  and  Balanced  Population  -  Creating  a  balanced  
 
  

 
  
 
mix  of  new  social  rented  homes  to  be  mixed  with  private  and  


intermediate  homes  creating  a  'tenure  blind'  developmen t  and  


genuinely  affordable  homes.  Provide  a  range  of  homes  from  1  to  5  

 

 
  
bedrooms  reflecting  housing  needs  of  the  area  with  generous  


proportions   and   private   amenity   space   provision.  
 
●
A  Low  Carbon  Community  -  Provision  of  a  new  E nergy  centre  in  line  

 
 
  

 
 
with   the   new   London   Plan.   
  
●
Making  the  Most  of  Water  -  Ensure  that  buildings  open  out  to  the  

 


New  River  and  reservoirs,  and  waterside  parkland  is  introduced  for  

 
 
 
recreational  enjoyment.  Continue  to  improve  the  waterside  


environment.  Deliver  a  Sustainable  Urban  Drainage  system  


throughout   the   site   maximising   water   recycling.   
  
●
A  Range  of  Open  Space  and  Play  Facilities  -  New  parks  and  open  

 


space  to  be  distributed  throughout  the  area  with  a  variety  of  play  and  

 


sports   facilities   to   suit   children   of   different   ages.  
 
●
An  Ecological  Network  -  Preserve  existing  trees  and  plant  additional  

 


trees  so  that  Woodberry  Down  keeps  a  green  feel  and  thrives  as  a  

 

 
place  for  wildlife  as  well  as  people.  Enhance  the  nature  conservation  


value   of   the   New   River,   particularly   next   to   the   reservoirs.   
  
●
A  Framework  for  Inspirational  Design  -  Provide  clear  connections  

 


between  the  north  and  south  of  the  site  by  creating  well  defined  links  


and  green  fingers  to  break  down  the  barrier  of  Seven  Sisters  Road,  


and  a  clear  network  of  open  spaces.  Provide  exceptional  design  


standards, 
 with 
 well 
 proportioned, 
 attractive 
 buildings 
 that  


incorporate   high   quality   materials.  

## Capacities:

## Planning   Status

This   is   a   major   regeneration   scheme,   being   carried   out   in   a   number   of   phases.   
  
   
 
The  original  outline  planning  permission  (ref  2008/1050)  for  the  redevelopment  


of  the  housing  estate  was  approved  in  July  2009,  under  which  the  initial  kick  


start   phases   on   the   development   were   constructed. A  hybrid  application  (2013/3223)  (an  outline  application  for  all  future  -  phases  

 
 
2-8  -  and  details  for  phase  2)  was  subsequently  approved  in  August  2014.  This  
  


was:  
 

  
"To  provide  up  to  275,604sqm  floorspace  GEA  (excluding  car  parking);  
    

comprising  up  to  3,242  residential  units  and  a  maximum  of  10,921sqm non-residential  floorspace  within  Classes  A1  (Retail),  A2  (Financial  Services),  
                 

A3  (Restaurants  and  Cafes), A4  (Drinking  Establishments),  Class  B1  (Offices), Class  D1  (Non  Residential  Institutions),  and  D2  use  and  Energy  Centres;  along  
       

with   provision   of   new   open   space   and   public   realm   and   associated   car   parking." Construction  has  started  on  several  sites  and  the  final  phase  of  work  will  not  be  


completed  until  beyond  the  end  of  the  plan  period  (2033).   A  total  of  1452  


(gross)  -  1,236  units  (net)  have  been  built  under  the  original  outline  permission  
  


and  a  further  216  units  (gross)  have  been  completed  for  phase  2  under  the  

 
 
 
2014  permission.  As  of  March  2018  there  were  a  further  563  units  (gross)  under  

 


constr uction.   A   new   school   was   completed   in    June   2011. Details   for   Phase   3   were   approved   by   the   Council   in   December   2015.

 Allocation :   Retention   of   community   use   with   residential  

## Development   Principles:

The  site  is  constrained  by  a  deep  building  line  and  proximity  of  


Nathaniel  Court.  There  is  potential  for  residential  development,  


including  maximising  the  delivery  of  genuinely  affordable  new  homes,  


above  re-provided  community  uses.  An  indicative  appropriate  building  


height   for   the   development   is   5-6   storeys.  
 
The  site  could  be  extended  to  include  the  site  at  256  Green  Lanes  


which  is  currently  used  as  storage  space  during  the  residential  


development  of  Woodberry  Down.  There  is  an  opportunity  to  make  a  

 
new   connection   to   the   development   at   Woodberry   Down   which   could   
  
create   a   reoriented   frontage   to   the   site. Indicative Capacity: 
 Approximately 
 50 
 residential units and  


reprovided   community   use.

## Policy   Hc1 Allocation:    Mixed   Use

 Development   principles: This  is  a  key  town  centre  site  to  be  developed  for  the  provision  of  new  
   


commercial  floorspace  and  housing,  including  genuinely  affordable  


homes.  Development  should  improve  permeability  through  the  Town  


Centre,  making  a  much  improved  contribution  to  this  key  town  centre  
 
  


location. Subject  to  TfL's  agreement,  there  may  be  potential  to  relocate  the  


Clapton  Bus  Garage  (without  compromising  TfL's  continuing  bus  


operations,  including  existing  bus  stand  provision)  to  an  alternative  


location,  or  reconfigure  the  site  to  facilitate  continuation  of  existing  


operations  whilst  achieving  redevelopment  aspirations.  There  is  


potential  to  utilise  Bohemia  Place  as  a  pedestrian  route  and  open  up  

 


the  railway  arches  to  improve  movement  through  the  site  for  a  new,  

 
 
east-west  route  and  the  creation  of  a  new  north-south  route  from  St  

 


John-at-Hackney  Churchyard  Gardens  through  the  railway  arches  on  


to  the  Tesco  site  and  beyond.  This  will  help  to  enable  movement  to  and  


from  the  Fashion  Hub  and  the  Town  Centre.  There  is  also  potential  to  

 


create  an  enlarged  public  square  at  the  bottom  of  the  Narrow  Way  


(with   the   potential   for   a   pavilion   building   to   activate   the   space). Any  proposed  mixed  use  development  must  preserve  the  historic  


setting  and  key  views  of  St  John-at-Hackney  Church  and  Churchyard,  


St  Augustine's  Tower  and  the  Old  Town  Hall,  and  maintain  the  church  


yard's  unique  sense  of  enclosure.  Appropriate  indicative  heights  are  3  -  

  
4  storeys.  A  heritage  assessment  of  buildings  on  site  and  a  recording  
 
  

 
 
condition   may   be   required.  

## Option   1   -   Courtyard   Block

A  comprehensive,  mixed  use  development  providing  commercial  


(retail/workspace)  and  residential  floorspace,  including  genuinely  


affordable  homes,  with  new  route  to  St  John-at-Hackney  Churchyard  


Gardens.  

## Option   2   -   Courtyard   Block   With   Enlarged   Square

A  comprehensive,  mixed  use  development,  providing  commercial  


(retail/workspace)  and  residential  floorspace,  including  genuinely  


affordable  homes,  with  a  new  route  to  St  John-at-Hackney  Churchyard  

 


Gardens   and   an   enlarged   square   at   the   bottom   of   the   Narrow   Way.  

## Option   3   -   Perimeter   Block   With   Enlarged   Square

A  comprehensive,  mixed  use  development,  providing  commercial  


(retail/workspace)  and  residential  floorspace,  including  genuinely  


affordable  homes,  with  a  new  route  to  St  John-at-Hackney  Churchyard  

 


Gardens,   and   an   enlarged   square   at   the   bottom   of   the   Narrow   Way.  


Indicative  Capacity:  140  residential  units  and  2,350sqm  of  


commercial   floorspace  
 

Planning   Status:    No   planning   activity.

## Policy   Hc2 Allocation:     Mixed   Use Development   Principles:

There  is  potential  for  redevelopment  of  the  existing  Tesco  superstore

opportunity  to  create  improved  permeability  through  the  town  centre  by  


the  creation  of  pedestrian  routes  through  the  site  and  through  the

the  Tesco  site,  creating  active  frontages.  Appropriate  indicative  heights  


are  2  -  10  storeys  alongside  taller  elements  which  should  be  sited  to  
   


15
minimise  overshadowing  and  create  visual  connection  with  existing  


taller  buildings  that  act  as  landmarks  along  the  north  south  routes.  Any  


taller  buildings  must  have  regard  to  and  address  heritage  assets  in  the  

 
 
vicinity. Consideration  will  need  to  be  given  to  transport  infrastructure  


improvements,  including  to  Hackney  Central  Overground  Station  and  


improvements  to  bus  stop  facilities,  and  to  CCTV  provision  to  increase  


surveillance   and   safety.  
 

## Option   1   -   Phased   Approach   For   Mixed-Use   Development

A  phased  development  which  considers  the  redevelopment  of  the  car  


park  portion  of  the  site  for  a  mixed  use  development,  commercial  


(retail,  including  a  potential  new  Tesco  store/workspace)  and  


residential,  including  genuinely  affordable  homes,  to  allow  the  existing  


Tesco  store  to  remain  operational  during  construction,  and  then  


redevelopment  of  the  existing  store  for  mixed  use  development  


commercial   (retail/workspace)   floorspace   and   residential.  
 

## Option   2   -   Comprehensive   Approach   For   Mixed-Use   Development

A  comprehensive  development  of  the  entire  site,  with  the  Tesco  store  


closed  during  the  construction  period,  for  the  provision  of  a  potential  

 
 
new  Tesco  store,  commercial  (retail/  workspace)  floorspace  and  


residential,   including   genuinely   affordable   homes.  
 
Existing   underground   infrastructure   includes:  
 

●
The  Channel  Tunnel  Railway  Link  which  runs  east-west  across  the  


site,  whose  tunnel  crown  level  is  estimated  at  approximately  32m  


below   ground.  
 
●
The  North  London  Flood  Relief  Sewer  which  runs  diagonally  across  


the   site   at   a   depth   of   approximately   18m.  
 
●
A  Thames  Water  combined  sewer  which  runs  across  the  site  whose  


crown   level   is   estimated   at   approximately   3.3m   below   ground   level.  
 

## Indicative  Capacity:  420  Residential  Units  And  15,550Sqm  Of Commercial   Floorspace

Planning  Status:  Pre-Application  discussion  for  the  redevelopment  of  the  site  


to  include  the  re-provision  of  Tesco  with  new  retail,  commercial  and  residential  


use.

Timescale :   Medium/Long   Term  
 



Policy   HC3 Allocation:    Commercial   -   retail   and   employment   workspace Development   Principles:  
 
The  Council  has  an  aspiration  to  reuse  the  former  Hackney  Central  


ticket  office  building  (which  is  Locally  Listed  along  with  1-5  Amhurst  


Road)  as  a  station  entrance.  There  is  the  potential  for  redevelopment  
 
  

 


of  the  car  park  for  the  provision  of  commercial  (retail  /  leisure  /  

 
  
workspace)  floorspace,  improved  public  realm  facilitating  connectivity  


and  wayfinding  and  the  retention  of  some  car  parking  (for  further  


details  see  Hackney  Central  and  Surrounds  Masterplan  SPD).  New  


development  should  deliver  an  improved  station  with  mixed  use,  


commercial  development  on  the  car  park,  and  a  new  station  entrance  

 


from  Amhurst  Road,  with  the  retention  of  some  car  parking  spaces  and  


an   improved   public   realm. There  is  an  opportunity  to  work  with  TfL  and  Network  Rail  to  deliver  


station  improvements  for  the  short,  medium  and  long  term,  including  


consideration  of  optimum  transport  infrastructure  delivery  to  meet  long  


term  need  (including  as  part  of  the  potential  delivery  of  a  Crossrail  2  

 
  
station).  


Development  proposals  should  have  regard  to  the  following  


development   principles:  

●
Create  an  active  frontage  at  ground  floor  and  ticket  hall  level,  


including  through  the  introduction  of  commercial  (retail/workspace)  


uses  to  animate  the  new  route  towards  the  station  and  increase  


surveillance  and  safety,  within  an  indicative  building  height  of  


between   2   -   3   storeys.  
 
●
Create  a  new  access  to  Hackney  Central  Overground  Station  from  
  


Amhurst   Road   with   DDA   compliant   lift  and   stairs.  
 
●
Create  new  public  space  as  a  forecourt  to  the  station  and  bus 


interchange  on  Amhurst  Road  to  draw  people  out  of  the  station  via  a  

 
new   route.  
 
●
Create  clear  sight  lines  to  the  station  entrance  from  Amhurst  Road  


to  aid  legibility  and  wayfinding  to  the  station,  encouraging  use  of  the  


new   route.  
 
●
Retain   existing   service   access   to   adjoining   development.  
 
●
Set  back  development  to  align  with  the  existing  building  line  on  


Amhurst   road.  
 
●
Provide   continuous,   active   frontages   along   Amhurst   Road.

## Policy   Hc5

 Allocation:    Mixed   use  
 

## Development   Principles:

There  is  potential  to  make  more  efficient  use  of  the  site.  Development  


should  result  in  a  net  gain  of  retail  floorspace  and  create  an  active  

 


frontage   on   to   Amhurst   Road   and   the   Narrow   Way. There  is  potential  for  the  retention  and  refurbishment  of  buildings,  


whilst  respecting  existing  heritage  assets,  with  the  creation  of  


additional  floorspace  from  a  mansard  roof  extension  and  infill  


development. There  is  also  potential  for  the  redevelopment  of  339-345  Mare  Street  


(corner   site). The  deliverability  of  the  options  is  subject  to  detailed  structural  surveys  

 


and   heritage   assessment   of   the   existing   buildings.   The   two   options are:  
 

## Option   1

Retention  with  infill  development  which  retains  all  existing  buildings,  


with  infill  and  mansard  development  above  the  existing  buildings  for  


commercial  (retail/workspace)  and  residential  uses  including  genuinely  


affordable   homes.  
 

## Option   2   -   Retention,   Infill   And   Redevelopment   Of   Corner   Site

An  infill  and  mansard  development  which  retains  347-357  Mare  


Street/6-18  Amhurst  Road  (M&S)  and  redevelopment  of  339-345  Mare  


Street  (corner  site),  for  commercial  (retail  /  workspace)  and  residential  

 


uses   including   genuinely   affordable   homes. Indicative  Capacity:  20  residential  units  and  200  sqm  of  new  


commercial   floorspace  


Planning  Status:  Pre-app  discussions  ongoing  for  redevelopment  and  


re-provision  of  retail  floorspace  which  includes  the  provision  of  the  M&S  site  with  


a   new   retail   frontage   on   Amhurst   Road.

## Policy   Hc9

 Allocation:    Mixed-use   employment-led   scheme  
 

## Development   Principles:

This  site  forms  part  of  the  Andrew's  Road  cluster  which  includes  40-43  


Andrews  Road  (London  Borough  of  Hackney  Car  Pound  -  Site  

 
 
Allocation  HC10).  The  wider  cluster  accommodates  key  transport  


infrastructure   which   includes   an   operational   bus   garage   at   Ash   Grove. An  opportunity  exists  to  renovate  this  site  as  part  of  the  wider  cluster  


through  the  relocation  of  the  Hackney  Housing  Depot  to  the  site,  


creating  a  new  active  frontage  along  Mare  Street.  Should  the  


relocation  of  the  Hackney  Housing  depot  to  this  site  not  be  possible,  


there  is  potential  for  mixed  use,  commercial  (workspace)  and  


residential  development,  including  maximising  the  provision  of  


genuinely   affordable   new   homes.  
 

## Option   1–   Refurbishment   For   Hackney   Housing   Depot

Refurbishment  and  reconfiguration  of  the  existing  building  for  a  


rationalised   Hackney   Housing   depot.  
 

## Option   2   -   Mixed-Use   Development   For   Hackney   Housing   Depot

A  mixed  use  development  which  provides  a  purpose  built  Hackney  


Housing  depot,  providing  a  material  store  with  mezzanine  level,  


associated  office  space,  yard  for  loading  of  vans  and  workshops.  


Mixed  use,  commercial  (workspace)  and  residential  development  


including  maximising  the  provision  of  genuinely  affordable  new  homes  


on   the   southern   part   of   the   site.  
 

## Option   3   -   Mixed-Use   Development

A  mixed  use  development  providing  residential,  including  maximising  


the  provision  of  genuinely  affordable  new  homes,  and  commercial  


(workspace)  floorspace,  whilst  utilising  the  adjacent  railway  arches  for  


commercial   use.  
 

 Indicative  Capacity:  80  residential  units  and  7,000sqm  of  commercial  


floorspace  


Planning  Status:  2016/2026:  61  Mare  Street  London  E8  4RG  -  Proposed

## Policy   Hc10 Allocation:    Mixed-Use   Employment-Led   Development Development   Principles:

The  site  at  40  -  43  Andrews  Road  is  underused  and  currently  

 


temporarily  used  as  a  car  pound.  There  is  potential  for  joint  


development  with  the  adjacent  Ash  Grove  Bus  Garage  site  (located  to  


the  north)  to  optimise  the  potential  for  development  of  both  sites.  This  


could  include  creating  a  larger  bus  garage  at  Ash  Grove  to  increase  

 


capacity  including  potential  relocation  of  some  spaces  and  operations  


from  the  Clapton  Bus  Garage,  as  part  of  a  mixed-use  development  

 
 
 
alongside  housing  (including  the  provision  of  genuinely  affordable  


housing  in  line  with  Policy  LP13)  and  commercial  development  along  


with   improved   access   /   egress   arrangements. Should  40-43  Andrews  Road  not  be  needed  to  accommodate  a  larger  

 
 
bus  garage  including  the  relocation  of  the  Clapton  Bus  Garage,  there  is  

 
potential  for  mixed-use,  employment-led  development  alongside  


residential,  including  maximising  the  provision  of  genuinely  affordable  


homes,  and  conversion  of  the  adjacent  railway  arches  for  employment  


(workspace)  use.  Any  development  should  consider  public  realm  


improvements  along  Andrews  Road  towards  Broadway  Market  


(including   along   the   towpath   and   The   Regent's  Canal). Development  will  need  to  address  any  environmental  pollution  and  


land  contamination  caused  by  the  Bethnal  Green  Gas  Holder  Station  


(located  to  the  south  of  The  Regent's  Canal).  Any  rationalisation  of  the  


site  as  a  depot,  either  individually  or  with  the  Ash  Grove  Garage,  would  
 
  


require  the  closure  of  Bush  Road.  Underground  utility  apparatus  have  


been  identified  on  this  site,  and  thus  any  development  needs  to  take  


this   into   consideration. Notwithstanding  the  Priority  Office  Area  designation,  the  improvement,  


re-provision  and  intensification  of  transport  operations  on  the  existing  


bus   garage   site   will   be   prioritised   over   office   provision. The  Council  is  working  with  partners  including  TfL  to  develop  a  


planning  brief  for  the  site  to  provide  further  guidance  including  


indicative   capacit ies   for   Options   2   and   3   
  

## Option   1   -   Mixed-   Use   Development   (40-   43   Andrews   Road)

A  mix  use  development  on  40-43  Andrews  Road  to  provide  


employment-led  development  with  residential,  whilst  converting  the  


adjacent   railway   arches   for   employment   (workspace   use).  
 

## Option   2   -   Bus   Depot   Site

Utilise  40-43  Andrews  Road  to  create  a  larger  bus  garage  at  Ash  


Grove  to  accommodate  spaces  from  Clapton  Bus  Garage.  The  


adjacent  railway  arches  should  be  converted  for  employment  


(workspace   use).  

## Option  3:  Mixed  Use  Development  Incorporating  Larger  Bus  Garage (40-43   Andrews   Road  And   Ash   Grove   Bus   Garage)

Comprehensive  mixed  use  redevelopment  to  create  a  larger  bus  


garage  to  provide  increased  capacity,  including  potential  relocation  of  


spaces  and  operations  from  the  Clapton  Bus  Garage;  provision  for  


parking,  charging  and  fuelling  of  hybrid,  electric  and  hydrogen  buses;  


state  of  the  art  maintenance  and  repair  facilities;  improved  access  and  


egress;  housing  (including  the  provision  of  genuinely  affordable  homes  


in   line   with   Policy   LP13)   and   commercial   development.   
  

## Indicative   Capacities:

Option  1  -  100  residential  units  and  8,700sqm  of  commercial  


floorspace  

Planning  Status:  Recent  planning  activity  on  the  site  relates  to  the  temporary  

use  of  the  site  as  the  Council  car  pound  and  the  Councils'  Passenger  Transport  


and   Meals   on   Wheels   services.

Development  Principles:   
  
The  site  comprises  a  builder's  merchant  with  ancillary  retail  facing  


Dalston  Lane.  Existing  buildings  are  one  and  two  storeys  and  the  rest  


of  the  operation  is  external.  The  historic  house  surrounded  by  the  site  

 


is  prominent  because  of  the  low-rise  surroundings.  Adjacent  to  the  site  


is  a  residential  tower  which  somewhat  detracts  from  the  setting  of  the  
  


house.   
  
There  is  opportunity  for  an  employment-led  development  including  


retention  of  the  storage,  light  industrial/  commercial  mix  with  


residential,  including  maximising  the  delivery  of  genuinely  affordable  


homes.  
 
  
The  historic  house  should  be  given  ample  space.  The  land  to  the  east  


of  the  house  and  the  backdrop  of  the  house  should  remain  unbuilt.  The  


front  garden  of  the  house  should  be  restored  to  original  proportions.  


The  site  has  development  potential  on  the  Dalston  Lane  frontage,  


where  ancillary  retail  should  be  retained.  There  is  also  potential  to  the  

 


west  and  north-west  of  the  site,  and  adjacent  to  the  neighbouring  tower  


where  development  could  help  mediate  between  scales.  The  historic  


plot  grain  and  commercial  building  frontage  position  should  be  


maintained   on  Dalston   Lane.  
 
  
Indicative  Capacity:  40  residential   units  and  provision   of  industrial/   
warehouse   floorspace.

There  is  potential  for  mixed-use  development  on  this  site  incorporating  
  


residential,  including  maximising  the  provision  of  genuinely  affordable  


homes,  and  commercial  floorspace.  Development  should  respond  to  

the  current  scale  of  enclosure  of  Dalston  Lane.  The  tallest  element  of  


the  scheme  should  be  set  back  from  Dalston  Lane.  Indicative  


appropriate  heights  on  this  site  is  in  the  range  of  4  to  6  storeys.  


Development  should  take  opportunities  to  improve  the  public  realm  


and  quality  of  pedestrian  arrival  at  Hackney  Downs  Station.  Existing  


buildings  nearby  serve  a  role  in  landmarking  the  location  of  the  station  

 


and  are  of  a  scale  commensurate  to  the  importance  of  the  station.  As  

 


such  there  is  no  justification  for  an  additional  landmark  tall  building  on  
 
  


this   site.

Any development on site should retain an element of  


community/leisure  uses  on  the  ground  floor  with  a  residential  element 

 
 
 
on  upper  floors.  Development  should  be  responsive  to  the  prevailing

 Allocation :   Mixed-use   residential   with   retail   at   ground   floor   level  
 

## Development   Principles:

The  site  currently  comprises  a  single  storey  retail  space  (Tesco)  


fronting  onto  Well  Street  and  Terrace  Road.  There  is  potential  for  the  


intensification  of  the  site  and  the  introduction  of  other  uses.  The  


airspace  above  the  store  would  be  suitable  for  residential  use,  


including  maximising  the  provision  of  genuinely  affordable  new  homes.  


The  existing  quantum  of  retail  floorspace  must  be  retained.  Any  new  


development  needs  to  be  in  keeping  with  the  scale  of  existing  buildings

Policy   CL1  
 
 Allocation:  Employment  or  employment–led  mixed-use  including  


residential   use.  
 

## Development   Principles   And   Issues:

This  allocation  makes  up  the  entire  Prout  Street  PIA;  as  a  result  any  

 
 
 
redevelopment  must  re-provide  the  existing  quantum  of  employment 


floorspace.    New   industrial   uses   are   encouraged   on   the   site.  


38  -  40  Upper  Clapton  Road,  also  known  as  the  Tram  Depot,  covers  
  


much  of  the  site  and  is  Locally  Listed  so  should  be  retained  and  its  


setting   enhanced. The  introduction  of  residential  uses  will  only  be  acceptable  if  the  


existing  industrial  and  employment  floorspace  is  re-provided  and  the  


provision  of  genuinely affordable  homes  is  maximised.  The  southern  


portion  of  the  site,  facing  residential  uses  on  Prout  Road,  may  provide  


the   best   opportunity   on   the   site   for   residential   development. The  garages  to  the  north  of  the  site  could  provide  an  opportunity  to  


extend  a  terrace  and  provide  a  new  access  route  between  Casimir  

 


Road   and   Cleveleys   Road. Indicative  Capacity:  50  residential  units  and  the  intensification  of  


industrial   floorspace.

 Allocation:    Community/education   and   residential   use  
 

## Development   Principles:

The  priority  is  to  restore  St  Mary's  Lodge  and  bring  the  building  back  

into  viable  use.  A  comprehensive  redevelopment  scheme  for  a  mixed  

 

 
 
use  community  (educational)  and  residential  scheme,  including  


genuinely  affordable  new  homes,  is  encouraged.  Any  proposal  would  


be  considered  in  line  with  the  adopted  St  Mary's  Lodge  Supplementary  


Planning   Document.  
 
 
Any  residential  development  on  the  site  should  prioritise  family-sized  


accommodation  as  there  is  demand  for  large  family-sized  homes  in  


this  location.  Any  residential  development  should  be  developed  


concurrently   with   the   community   use.  
 
Proposals  on  this  site  will  need  to  adopt  a  conservation  sensitive  


approach  that  is  driven  by  the  setting  issues  to  St  Mary's  Lodge  and  its  
 
  


context  in  the  conservation  area.  There  are  two  main  scenarios  for  


development   on   the   site:  

●
Scenario  1:  Development  of  St  Mary's  Lodge,  73  Lordship  Road  


(land   parcel   A);   or  
 
●
Scenario  2:  Comprehensive  redevelopment  of  the  three  plots  69-73  


Lordship   Road   (land   parcels   A   and   B).  
 
●
There  is  also  a  possible  Scenario  2a  for  the  development  of  the  two  
  
  


plots  of  land  at  71  and  73  Lordship  Road,  i.e.  St  Mary's  Lodge  and  


the  adjacent  car  park  but  excluding  the  synagogue.  This  option  


would  be  very  similar  in  building  footprint  and  height  to  Scenario  2,  


but  with  different  boundary  conditions/treatments  and  access  


arrangements. High  level  viability  discussions  indicate  that  it  should  be  viable  for  a  

 

 
developer  to  include  a  proportion  of  affordable  housing  as  part  of  a  

 

 
comprehensive  mixed  use  redevelopment  scheme  in  accordance  with  


Hackney's  affordable  housing  policy.  Any  departure  from  the  uses  put  


forward  in  the  Site  Allocations  and  Planning  Brief  or  a  non-compliant 

 
 
affordable   housing   offer   would   be   subject   to   a   full   viability   review.  


Indicative   Capacity:    10   family   sized   homes   and   1,000sqm   of community   use  
 


## Planning   Status:     Pre-App   Discussions   Ongoing.

2016/1003  -  Erection  of  part  two-storey,  part  three  storey  rear  extension  with

at  partial  basement  level  below  (all  floorspace  for  synagogue  and  ancillary  


purposes  falling  within  Use  Class  D1);  alterations  to  configuration  of  on-site  car  


parking   in   front   portion   of   site.   Decision:   Granted.

## Policy   Shx1

 Allocation:  Mixed  use  including  residential,  and  supporting  retail,  and  


community   facilities  
 

 Development   Principles:  
 
The  former  Rose  Lipman  Library  is  part  of  a  housing  estate  and  


previously  housed  the  Archive  Library  before  it  was  relocated  to  the  

 

new  Dalston  Library.  The  re-provision  of  community  facilities  for  the  


local  area  is  required  on  this  site,  which  may  be  achieved  through  the  
 
  


retention  and  refurbishment  of  the  former  Rose  Lipman  Library  as  part  


of  a  wider  redevelopment  scheme  incorporating  residential  uses  


including  the  maximising  the  provision  of  genuinely  affordable  new  


homes. Development  on  this  site  should  help  to  re-establish  a  block  layout  with  

 


clear  fronts  facing  the  street  and  private  courtyards  /  gardens  for  

 
 
 
residents  at  the  rear.  Development  should  aim  to  repair  and  clarify  the  


street  network  through  the  site  and  should  re-establish  a  consistent 

 
 
scale   of   built   frontage   and   enclosure   to   the   street. An  indicative  appropriate  building  height  for  the  site  is  in  the  range  of  4  

  

 
to  6  storeys.  The  Downham  Road  frontage  will  need  to  have  respect  to  
  


the  low  scale  of  existing  buildings  opposite.  The  site  is  flanked  on  three  

 


sides  by  three  18  storey  tower  blocks.  Additional  tower  developments  


will  not  be  justified  on  the  basis  that  there  are  already  tall  buildings  


nearby  and  there  is  no  strategic  reason  to  mark  the  site  with  additional  

 


tall   buildings. Indicative  Capacity :  200  Residential  units  and  1,650sqm  of  


community   use

 Allocation:    Mixed-use   community   and   residential  
 

## Development   Principles:

This  site  occupies  a  block  between  Hoxton  High  Street  and  Kingsland  

 


Road.  It  has  the  potential  to  accommodate  a  more  intensive  


mixed-use  development  to  support  Hoxton  High  Street  as  a  


commercial  and  employment  destination.  The  site  potentially  has  the  


capacity  to  accommodate  significant  community  infrastructure,  (which  


could  include  health  and  education  uses),  space  for  a  range  of  


businesses  and  a  mix  of  housing  types  and  tenures,  including  


genuinely   affordable   new   homes. Publicly  accessible  open  space  should  be  provided  on  the  site  for  use  


by  new  and  existing  residents  and  to  support  local  biodiversity.  

Development  should  have  a  clear  and  legible,  street-based  layout  and  

 


buildings  should  have  clear  fronts  and  backs.  Connections  should  be  


made  across  and  through  the  site  to  improve  links  between  Hoxton  


Street   and   Kingsland   Road.      


Historic  hospital  buildings  should  be  re-used  and  reconfigured  and  


development  should  enhance  the  setting  of  Christ  Apostolic  Church.  


Development  should  respond  to  the  predominant  scale,  materiality  and  


character   of   the   local   area.   
  
 
 
Indicative  Capacity:  Site  capacities  will  be  obtained  through  detailed  


masterplanning   and   an   associated   development   brief   for   the   site

Timescale:   Long   term  
 

## Policy   Shx3

 Allocation:  Commercial  led  development  with  adjoining  Museum  of  


London  Archaeology  (MOLA)  site  to  accommodate  Crossrail  2  


ventilation   shaft  
 

 Development  Principles:  The  site  currently  contains  a  double-height  

 
 
single  storey  B8  storage  warehouse.  There  is  potential  for  


intensification  of  the  site,  along  with  the  adjoining  MOLA  storage  site,  


to  accommodate  an  employment  led  development  with  replacement  B8  


uses, Crossrail 
 2 
 ventilation shaft and associated enabling  


development.  A  net  loss  of  B8  floorspace  may  be  necessary  to  support  
  


the  delivery  of  the  Crossrail  2  ventilation  shaft  and  will  only  be  


acceptable  in  these  circumstances.  The  site  is  suitable  for  employment  

 


development  (including  ventilation  shaft)  or  employment-led  mixed-use  


development  (incorporating  a  ventilation  shaft)  with  residential  and  


maximising  the  delivery  of  genuinely  affordable  new  homes.  A  public  

 
 
route   through   to   (and   along)   Regents   Canal   should   be   provided.

## 14. Implementation   And   Monitoring

 
 
14.1 This  section  provides  an  overview  of  the  ways  the  Council  will  deliver  and  


monitor  the  delivery  of  the  Local  Plan's  vision,  objectives  and  policies.  It  focuses  

 
 
on   how   we   will:   
  
 
 
●
Work  to  deliver  the  growth  strategy  and  area  priorities  set  out  in  the  Place  


Policies  
 
●
Support   the   delivery   of   sites   allocated   in   the   Plan  
 
●
Make   use   of   planning   obligations   and   the   Community   Infrastructure   Levy   
  
●
Take   account   of   issues   of   development   viability   and   contingency  
 

## Delivering  The  Growth  Strategy

14.2 The  growth  strategy  set  out  by  this  plan  has  been  articulated  at  an  area  based  


level  through  the  Place  Policies.  The  vision,  development  principles  and  sites  


identified  through  each  Place  Policy  set  out  the  high  level  framework  for  the  


future  development  of  each  area.  More  detailed  guidance  in  the  form  of  Area  


Action  Plans  and  masterplans  will  be  developed  over  the  life-time  of  the  plan  to  


bring   forward   development.   
  
 
 
14.3 The  areas  of  most  significant  growth  or  sensitivity  to  change  are  already  being  


progressed  alongside  the  development  of  the  Local  Plan  through  the  


preparation  of  the  Shoreditch  and  Stamford  Hill  AAPs.  Hackney's  Planning  


Service  is  structured  to  include  a  Delivery  Team  which  focuses  on  area  based  

 


planning  documents  intended  to  promote  the  delivery  of  development.  This  


includes  the  preparation  of  area  based  supplementary  planning  documents  


(SPDs),  masterplans  or  planning  briefs  which  set  out  more  detailed  proposals  


with  support  from  the  community,  landowners  and  developers.  There  is  an  


existing  masterplan  SPD  in  place  for  Hackney  Central  and  Surrounds  which  


includes  detailed  proposals  for  all  of  the  key  town  centre  sites  as  well  as  


guidance  on  improvements  to  transport  links  and  the  wider  public  realm.  The  


next  areas  prioritised  for  further  planning  guidance  include  Dalston  town  centre,  


Clapton/   Lea   Bridge   Roundabout   and   Homerton.  


14.4 In  addition  to  the  planning  framework,  the  Council  will  progress  the  delivery  and  


implementation  of  the  place  policies  by  preparing  regeneration  delivery  plans  for  


different  growth  areas  and  town  centres.  The  preparation  of  these  plans  will  be  


informed  by  community  and  stakeholder  engagement  in  different  places  


alongside  an  up  to  date  evidence  base  for  each  area.  The  delivery  plans  will  


encompass  a  broad  range  of  area  interventions  including  development  sites,  
  


transport  and  public  improvements  and  economic  interventions  to  deliver  holistic  


improvements  on  an  area  basis.  Once  the  delivery  plans  are  in  place  the  


Regeneration  Team  will  work  strategically  across  different  services  areas  in  the  


Council  and  with  external  partners  and  stakeholders  to  deliver  the  identified  


projects   and   initiatives.   
  

 
 
14.5 Hackney  is  taking  a  lead  role  in  delivering  new  homes  in  the  Borough.  Our  


cross-subsidy  approach  will  directly  deliver  nearly  2,000  new  homes  in  4  years 

 
 
between  2018  and  2022.  These  are  built,  owned  and  managed  by  the  Council,  


with  any  homes  that  we  need  to  sell  to  pay  for  these  done  in-house  through  our  


sales   and   marketing   team,   Hackney   Sales.  


14.6 More  than  half  of  these  will  be  genuinely  affordable  Council  homes  for  social  


rent  and  shared  ownership,  partly  paid  for  by  building  and  selling  some  homes  


for  outright  sale.  Whether  social  rent  homes  for  those  who  need  them  most,  or  


low  cost  home  ownership  options  for  those  struggling  to  get  on  the  housing  


ladder,   these   homes   put   Hackney   residents   first.  


14.7 As  well  as  building  homes  directly,  we  also  help  housing  associations  and  other  


providers  to  build  new  homes  -  through  the  5,500-home  regeneration  of  the  

 


Woodberry  Down  Estate,  or  through  grants  made  up  of  money  from  homes  sold  


under   Right   to   Buy   to   help   make   smaller   schemes   more   affordable.  


14.8 Since  2011,  more  than  1,500  homes  have  been  completed  at  Woodberry  Down  


-  with  more  than  half  for  social  rent  and  shared  ownership.  We  predict  another  


900  homes  will  be  built  there,  or  by  providing  grants  for  schemes  elsewhere,  


between   2018   and   2022.  


14.9 The  need  for  new  workspace  is  also  identified  in  the  Local  Plan  and  the  delivery  

 
 
  


of  affordable  workspace  is  a  key  priority.  The  Regeneration  team  are  working  on 

  


a  number  of  projects  and  initiatives  in  different  areas  to  maximise  the  delivery  of  

 


new  affordable  workspace.  These  include  re-purposing  Council  buildings  and  


sites  for  affordable  workspace,  working  with  strategic  partners  in  areas  such  as  


Hackney  Wick  to  deliver  new  commercial  space,  and  working  with  other  


stakeholders  to  identify  opportunities  for  the  delivery  of  additional  affordable  


workspace   across   the   Borough.   
  
 
 
14.10 The  Council  also  provides  business  advice  and  engagement  to  both  existing  


businesses  and  those  considering  locating  in  the  Borough  to  ensure  businesses  

 


are   supported   to   develop,   grow   and   thrive.  
 

## Site  Delivery

14.11 The  site  allocations  in  the  Local  Plan  are  the  key  delivery  mechanism  for  


achieving  the  identified  housing,  employment,  retail  and  infrastructure  needs  set  


out  in  the  Local  Plan.  It  is  therefore  crucial  to  the  delivery  of  the  growth  strategy  

  


that  development  sites  deliver  the  allocated  uses.  It  is  therefore  vital  that  the  

 


council,  landowners  and  developers  engage  as  soon  as  possible  in  the  


development   process.   
  

 
 
14.12 Work  on  site  based  planning  documents  focuses  on  early  engagement  with  


landowners  and  developers  as  key  stakeholders  to  take  into  account  any  issues  


that  may  impact  on  the  deliverability  of  development.  The  Council  will  also  seek  


to  work  cooperatively  with  communities  in  the  preparation  of  area-based  plans  


and  proposals.  The  benefits  of  this  approach  has  already  been  demonstrated  


through  the  successful  adoption  of  the  Hackney  Central  and  Surrounds  


Masterplan  SPD,  where  there  has  been  progress  on  key  sites  and  proposals  


such  as  the  Tesco  site,  the  completion  of  the  pedestrianisation  of  the  Narrow  


Way   and   the   proposed   Liveable   Neighbourhoods   scheme   along   Amhurst   Road.  

## Implementation  Of  Policy

14.13 The  development  management  process  is  a  key  mechanism  for  achieving  many  

  


of  the  objectives  of  the  Local  Plan.  Most  development  requires  planning  


permission  (other  than  that  allowed  under  'permitted  development  rights')  and  


Hackney  Council  is  the  statutory  local  planning  authority  for  the  majority  of  the  


Borough,  with  the  power  to  determine  planning  applications  and  enforce  the  


implementation  of  policies  and  decisions.  However,  part  of  the  Borough  primarily  


including  the  area  of  Hackney  Wick  adjacent  to  the  Queen  Elizabeth  Olympic  


Park  has  a  separate  local  planning  authority  known  as  the  London  Legacy 


Development  Corporation  (LLDC).  The  extent  of  the  LLDC's  area  within  the  


Borough  can  be  viewed  on  the  Policies  Map.  Major  applications  in  both  areas  


are   also   subject   to   the   Mayor's  powers   of   refusal   or   determination.   
  
 
 
14.14 The  development  management  process  provides  an  opportunity  to  manage  the  


form  that  development  takes  in  the  Borough,  in  relation  to  its  location,  scale,  


design  and  appearance,  and  the  use  of  land.  In  particular  pre-application  


discussions   are   an   important   tool.  


14.15 New  development  within  the  Borough  will  also  add  incrementally  to  the  need  for  


new  infrastructure  and  the  overall  picture  of  infrastructure  need  throughout  the  


plan  period  is  set  out  in  the  Infrastructure  Delivery  Plan.  To  support  this  growth,  
 
  


the  Borough  will  need  to  provide  new  infrastructure  and  in  some  cases  maintain  

 


and  upgrade  elements  of  the  existing  infrastructure.  The  way  in  which  


development  contributes  towards  community  infrastructure  will  be  guided  by  the  


Planning  Contributions  SPD  and  the  Hackney  Community  Infrastructure  Levy  


Charging   Schedule.   
  
 
 
14.16 The  Council's  Infrastructure  Delivery  Plan,  supplemented  by  regeneration  


delivery  plans,  will  progress  the  delivery  of  identified  infrastructure  needs  for  


different   parts   of   the   Borough.   
  
 
 
14.17 The  Community  Infrastructure  Levy  Regulation  123  list  sets  out  those  items  that  


Council  intends  will  be  wholly  or  partially  funded  through  the  Hackney  


Community  Infrastructure  Levy.  The  list  does  not  prioritise  infrastructure  funding  


and  does  not  limit  the  Council  to  spending  the  Community  Infrastructure  Levy  on  


these  pieces  of  infrastructure.  However  in  setting  the  list,  the  Council  is  stating  

 
 
that  it  will  not  be  seeking  S106  planning  obligations  for  any  infrastructure  or  
  


types   of   infrastructure   included   on   the   list.  


14.18 It  will  also  be  vital  to  ensure  that  development  proposals  continue  to  provide  or  


fund  local  improvements  and  non-infrastructure  items  required  to  mitigate  the  


impact  of  development  and/or  facilities,  and  requirements  made  necessary  by  


the  development. 
 The  provision  of  affordable  housing,  local  open  space  


improvements 
 and/or 
 additional 
 facilities 
 and 
 requirements 
 (including  


employment  and  skills  initiatives,  affordable  workspace,  green  links  and  on-site  


provision  of  specific  infrastructure)  and  securing  appropriate  scheme  


implementation  and  control  of  phasing  where  necessary  will  be  delivered  


through  Section  106  planning  obligations  as  set  out  in  the  Planning  


Contributions   SPD.  
 

## Viability  And  Contingency

14.19 Hackney's  Economic  Viability  Study  (2018)  assesses  the  cumulative  impact  of  


the  Council's  planning  requirements,  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  the  


National  Planning  Policy  Framework  and  the  Local  Housing  Delivery  Group  


guidance  'Viability  Testing  Local  Plans':  It  demonstrates  that  policies  do  not  


undermine   the   deliverability   of   the   Plan.  


14.20 It  is  recognised  that  the  housing  and  commercial  property  markets  are  


inherently  cyclical  and  that  the  plan  has  been  prepared  when  the  market  has  


experienced  a  period  of  sustained  growth.  Forecasts  for  future  house  price  


growth  point  to  continuing  growth  in  mainstream  London  housing  markets,  


although  there  is  a  degree  of  uncertainty  following  the  referendum  on  the  UK's  

 


membership  of  the  European  Union.  This  is  reflected  in  both  the  sensitivity  


testing   in   the   Economic   Viability   Study   and   the   flexibility   of   policies.   
  

## Monitoring

14.21 The  Local  Plan  will  be  monitored  to  enable  an  understanding  of  the  extent  to  


which  the  Local  Plan  policies  deliver  the  Council's  vision  and  objectives  for  


Hackney.  


14.22 Changing  circumstances  means  that  the  monitoring  of  policies  is  required  to  


deliver,  manage,  and  if  necessary  adapt  or  bring  forward  an  alternative  planning  

 


approach  to  Hackney's  growth  and  meeting  the  Borough's  needs  for  homes,  


jobs,   services   and   infrastructure.  


14.23 The  Council  will  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  the  Local  Plan  by  regularly  


assessing  its  performance  against  a  series  of  quantitative  indicators.  The  


Council's  performance  will  be  reported  in  the  annual  authority  monitoring  report  


(AMR),   which   will:  


●
assess   the   performance   of   the   Local   Plan   policies;  
 
●
set   out   the   Council's  updated   housing   trajectory;  
 
●
identify   the   need   to   reassess   or   review   any   policies   or   approaches;  
 
●
identify  trends  in  the  wider  social,  economic  and  environmental  issues  


facing   Hackney.  


14.24 The  AMR  also  reports  on  the  collection  and  spend  of  the  Community  


Infrastructure  Levy  and  S106  obligations  in  accordance  with  government  


regulations.  
 
  

## Appendix Marketing Evidence And Marketing Strategy 1 Appendix   1:   Marketing   Evidence And   Marketing   Strategy Introduction

1.1 This  appendix  links  to  Policies  LP8  Social  and  Community  Infrastructure,  LP26  


New  Employment  Floorspace,  LP27  Protecting  and  Promoting  Office  


Floorspace  in  the  Borough,  LP28  Protecting  and  Promoting  Industrial  Land  


and  Floorspace  in  the  Borough,  LP33  Hackney  Central  and  Dalston,  LP34  


Stoke  Newington,  Stamford  Hill  and  Finsbury  Park,  LP35  Local  Shopping  


Centres   and     LP36   Shops   Outside   of   Designated   Centres.  


1.2 Marketing  evidence  is  required  at  submission  of  a  planning  application  for  two  
 
  

 


main   purposes: ●
Firstly  to  justify  the  quantum  of  employment  land  provided  within  a  


scheme,  particularly  where  mixed  use,  is  the  maximum  amount  possible  


for   a   site   as   part   of   any   redevelopment.   
  
●
Secondly,  where  a  loss  of  either  employment,  retail  or  community  


land/floorspace  is  proposed  as  part  of  a  development  proposal  marketing  

 


evidence  is  required  to  demonstrate  there  is  no  realistic  prospect  of  the  


land/floorspace  being  used/  re-used  for  its  existing  purposes,  or  for  


continued   operation   in   its  current   lawful   use.   
  

## Employment  Land  And  Floorspace

1.3 For  employment  land  and  floorspace  located  within  POAs,  and  where  a  


scheme  is  not  proposed  as  being  employment  led  in  accordance  with  relevant  
  

 


policies,  applicants  will  need  to  provide  marketing  evidence  demonstrating  that  


an  employment  led  scheme  is  not  viable  for  the  subject  site  and  that  what  is  

 
proposed  is  the  maximum  quantum  the  site  can  accommodate.  For  other 


employment  sites  outside  of  POAs  marketing  evidence  should  again 


demonstrate  that  the  quantum  of  employment  floorspace  proposed  is  the  


maximum   amount   the   site   can   viably   deliver.  


1.4 For  all  schemes  affecting  employment  land  and  floorspace  it  will  be  expected,  

 


in  addition  to  the  marketing  evidence  specified  under  paragraphs  1.8  to  1.10  


below,  that  evidence  is  provided  which  demonstrates  that  the  site  has  been  


marketed  for  policy  compliant  uses  in  the  first  instance  and  if  found  not  to  be  

 


possible,  then  for  alternative  generating  employment  uses  (refer  to  Policies  


LP26,  LP27  and  LP28).  A  site's  'existing  use  value'  should  accurately  reflect  

 


the  site's  existing  use  so  as  to  assist  the  Council  in  the  robust  assessment  of  


financial  viability  information  submitted  (as  required  by  Policies  LP26,  LP27  


and  LP28).  For  instance  the  purchase  of  an  employment  site  based  on  


generally  higher  non-employment  values  will  not  be  considered  adequate  


justification  to  reduce  employment  land  and  floorspace  within  any  proposed  


development.  Furthermore,  applicants  are  required  to  demonstrate  market  


testing  of  a  number  of  policy  compliant  land  use  scenarios  (i.e.  looking  at  a  
 
  

 
range  of  commercial  uses)  as  part  of  clearly  demonstrating  that  the  proposed  


land  use  mix  incorporates  the  maximum  amount  of  employment  floorspace  


possible  on  a  site.  Where  the  above  cannot  be  demonstrated,  proposed  


schemes   will   not   be   considered   to   have   met   Policies   LP27   and   LP28.  

1.5 For  all  employment  floorspace,  it  must  also  be  shown  that  the  site/land  has  

 


been  both  adequately  marketed  through  a  commercial  agent  at  a  price  that  

 

 
 
 
reflects  market  value  for  employment  use  for  a  minimum  of  two  years,  with  no  

 


realistic  prospect  of  employment  generating  use/re-use,  including  provision  for  


smaller   flexible   units.  
 

## Retail,  Social  And  Community  Land  And  Floorspace

1.6 For  all  retail,  social  and  community  land  and  floorspace,  it  must  also  be  shown  

 


that  the  site/land  has  been  both  adequately  marketed  through  a  commercial  

 
 
agent  at  a  price  that  reflects  market  value  for  either  the  retail,  social  and/or  
 
  


community  use.  In  these  instances,  there  is  a  reduced  marketing  period  of  one  

  


year.   Marketing   evidence   is   to   be   in   accordance   with   paragraphs   1.8   to   1.10.  

## Components  Of  Active  Marketing

1.7 The  following  requirements  for  marketing  evidence  are  applicable  to  all  


employment  land,  retail,  social  and  community  land  and  floorspace  as  well  as  


designated  heritage  assets  as  described  above.  It  must  be  shown  to  the  


Council's  satisfaction  that  marketing  has  been  unsuccessful  for  all  relevant  


floorspace   proposed   to   be   lost   through   redevelopment   or   change   of   use.  


1.8 Where  marketing  information  is  required,  the  following  details  will  be  used  to  


assess  the  acceptability,  or  otherwise,  of  the  information  submitted  and  


marketing   undertaken.   
  
 
 
1.9 Active  marketing  should  include  evidence  of  all  of  the  following,  subject  to  


specific   circumstances:  
 
1.
Registration  of  the  property  with  at  least  two  reputable  commercial  


property   agents.   
  
2.
Contact  information  posted  in  a  prominent  location  on  site  in  the  form  of  

  

 


an   advertising   board   for   the   duration   of   the   marketing   period.  
 
3.
The  property  and  marketing  information  was  posted  on  the  internet  in  


popular  areas  such  as  commercial  property  selling/letting  websites  


(including   dates   and   duration   of   posting).   
  
4.
The  property  and  marketing  details  were  posted  in  local  newspapers  


(not  an  obligatory  requirement  if  evidence  of  marketing  on  wide  


audience  property  websites  has  been  demonstrated,  but  obligatory  if  

 
not   the   case).   
  
5.
The   property   details/particulars   were   available   to   inquirers   on   request.   
  
6.
The  property  was  registered  with  the  Council's  Economic  Regeneration  


Team.  
 
7.
The  property  was  marketed  in  terms  of  redevelopment  opportunities  for  


a   range   of   policy   compliant   uses   as   well   as   the   proposed   use.   
  
8.
The  property  was  marketed  at  a  reasonable  price  based  on  the  agents  

 


professional  advice  (details  to  be  supplied),  including  in  relation  to  use,  


condition,  quality  and  location  of  floorspace  (see  bullet  10).  For  heritage  


assets,  particularly  those  in  need  of  remedial  work,  the  market  price  


may   need   to   be   low   or   even   zero.  
 
9.
Where  appropriate,  action  was  taken  to  refurbish  or  reconfigure  the  


existing  vacant  stock  in  order  to  meet  the  identified  needs  of  local  


businesses  or  community  groups  (where  relating  to  social  and  


community   facilities)   subject   to   financial   viability.  
 
10.
A  professional  valuation  from  at  least  three  agents  to  confirm  the  value  


of  the  site  and  /  or  existing  rental  levels,  rental  levels  of  the  last  four  

 


years,  and  future  rental  levels  sought,  if  appropriate  (including  dates  of  

 


valuation).   
  
11.
Advertisements  should  include  basic  information  such  as  site  location,  


size  in  sq.ft  or  sq.m,  site  description,  property  type,  specifications  and  


costs  (including  rent  per  sq  ft.,  service  charge  per  sq  ft.,  and  any  other  


charges.    
12.
The  property  details  /  particulars  available  to  inquirers  on  request  and  

 


details  of  any  offers  received,  reasons  for  refusal  and/or  reasons  why  


offers   fell   through.  
 
13.
If  it  is  the  case  that  the  existing  tenant  of  the  site  intended  to  move  out,  
   


evidence  that  efforts  were  made  to  retain  tenants/occupiers  within  the  


scheme,   as   well   as   reasons   why   the   existing   tenant   moved   out.  
 
14.
Marketing  must  be  for  all  relevant  floorspace  intended  to  be  


redeveloped   or   subject   to   a   change   of   use.   
  
15.
Existing  rental  levels,  rental  levels  of  the  last  four  years,  and  future  


rental   levels   sought,   if  appropriate.

to  be  made  by  inclusion  within  a  local  development  plan  or  neighbourhood  


development  plan.  The  designation  should  only  be  used  where  the  land  is  not 


extensive,  is  local  in  character  and  reasonably  close  to  the  community;  and,  


where  it  is  demonstrably  special,  for  example,  because  of  its  beauty,  historic  
  


significance,  recreational  value  (including  as  a  playing  field),  tranquillity  or  


richness  of  its  wildlife.  Policies  within  the  local  development  plan  or  


neighbourhood  development  plan  for  managing  development  within  a  Local  


Green  Space  should  be  consistent  with  the  policies  protecting  green  belts  within

provide  guidance  on  Opportunity,  Intensification  and  Regeneration  Areas,  town  


centres,  suburbs  and  Strategic  Employment  Locations.  The  frameworks  will  be  


consistent  with,  and  provide  further  guidance  on,  the  policies  in  this  plan.  


Sub-Regional   Development   Frameworks   will   be   non-statutory   documents.  
 

## Supplementary Planning  Document  (Spd)  -  Supplementary  Planning

Documents  provide  supplementary  information  to  support  the  policies  in  


Development  Plan  Documents.  They  do  not  form  part  of  the  Development  Plan  


and   are   not   subject   to   independent   examination.  
 
Supplementary  Planning  Guidance  (SPG)  -  Supplementary  Planning  Guidance  

 


may  cover  a  range  of  issues,  both  thematic  and  site  specific  and  provide  further  
 
  


detail   of   policies   and   proposals   in   a   development   plan.  
 
Support   for   events   and   community   use   of   the   open   parkland.  
 
Sustainability  Appraisal  (SA)  -  a  formal,  systematic  process  to  assess  the  

 


environmental,  economic  and  social  effects  of  strategies  and  policies  from  the  


start  of  preparation  onwards.  The  process  includes  the  production  of  reports  to  


explain   the   outcomes   of   the   appraisal.   
  
Sustainable  Community  Strategy  -  a  document  which  plans  for  the  future  of  

  


Hackney  across  a  wide  range  of  topics,  and  sets  out  a  vision  and  a  series  of  
 
  

 
 
  
 
 
aspirations.  The  local  strategic  partnership  (Team  Hackney)  has  responsibility  for  


producing  the  document  which  sets  out  four  main  priorities  that  all  partners  work  


towards.  It  is  part  of  the  evidence  base  for  the  Local  Plan,  but  not  part  of  the  Local  
   


Plan   itself.   
  
Sustainable  Construction  Techniques  -  Key  themes  for  action  to  achieve  

 


sustainable  construction  include:  design  for  minimum  waste;  lean  construction  &  

 
minimise  waste;  minimise  energy  in  construction  and  use;  do  not  pollute;  preserve  

 


&  enhance  biodiversity;  conserve  water  resources;  respect  people  &  local  


environment;   monitor   &   report,   (i.e.   use   benchmarks). Sustainable  Development  -  usually  referred  to  as  "development  which  meets  the  
 
  


needs  of  the  present  without  compromising  the  ability  of  future  generations  to  


meet   their   own   needs"   (Brundtland,   1987).   
  
Sustainable  Drainage  Systems  (SuDS)  -  an  overall  term  for  systems  of  surface  

 


water  drainage  management  that  take  into  account  the  quantity  and  quality  of  


runoff,  and  the  amenity  value  of  surface  water  in  the  urban  environment.  The  


main  focus  is  on  source  control  and  the  mimicking  of  natural  processes  to  enable  
 
  


infiltration   and   gradual   discharge   into   watercourses.   
  
Taller  Building  -  Buildings  or  structures  that  are  50%  taller  than  the  prevailing  
 
  


building  height  or  which  significantly  change  the  skyline  or  are  30  metres  or  more  


in   height.  
 
Temporary  Accommodation  -  A  place  where  homeless  people  are  placed  while  
 
   


waiting  to  be  allocated  permanent  housing.  The  Council  can  provide  temporary  


accommodation  in  a  range  of  different  types  of  housing,  such  as  a  bedsit,  a  flat,  a  
 
  

 
  
  
house,   a   place   in   a   hostel   or   in   a   bed   and   breakfast. Tenure  -  The  conditions  under  which  land  or  buildings  are  held  or  occupied.  In  
  


terms  of  housing,  for  example,  homes  may  be  social,  private-rented  or  


owner-occupied.   
  
The  Act  -  the  Planning  and  Compulsory  Purchase  Act  2004,  which  put  in  place  
 
  


the   statutory   framework   for   preparing   the   LDF   (now   the   Local   Plan).   
  
The  Regulations  -  the  Town  and  Country  Planning  (Local  Development)  


(England)  Regulations  2004,  as  amended  by  the  Town  and  Country  Planning  


(Local   Development)  (England)  (Amendment)  Regulations  2008  and  the  Town  


and  Country  Planning  (Local  Development)  (England)  (Amendment)  Regulations  


2009;  and  the  Town  and  Country  Planning  (Transitional  Arrangements)  


Regulations   2004.   
  
Town  Centre  -  Town  centres  will  usually  be  the  second  level  of  centres  after  city  
 
  


centres  and,  in  many  cases,  they  will  be  the  principal  centre  or  centres  in  a  local  

 
 
authority's  area.  In  London  the  'major'  and  many  of  the  'district'  centres  identified  


in  the  Mayor's  Spatial  Development  Strategy  typically  perform  the  role  of  town  


centres.  
 
Town  Centre  Management -  Activities  associated  with  town  centre  management  

 


are  generally  operational  and  result  in  improvements  to  the  appearance  of  town  


centres.  In  some  instances  such  activities  include  works  such  as  installation  of  


lighting,  CCTV,  minimising  fly  tipping,  enforcement  activities  and  public  


realm/highways   improvements.   
  
Transport  Assessment  -  A  process  that  sets  out  transport  issues  relating  to  
 
  


development   proposals.  
 
Transport  Statement/Local  Level  Transport  Threshold  -  A  transport  statement  

  
 
 
for  a  smaller  development,  Threshold  details  are  contained  in  the  Hackney  


Transport   Strategy.  
 
Travel  Plan  -  A  long-term  management  strategy  that  encourages  active,  efficient  
 
   


and  sustainable  travel  for  new  and  existing  developments.  It  sets  out  transport  

 


impacts,  establishes  targets  and  identifies  the  package  of  measures  needed  for  


improvement.  
 
Tree  Preservation  Order  (TPOs) -  A  mechanism  for  securing  the  preservation  of  

 


single  or  groups  of  trees  of  acknowledged  amenity  value.  A  tree  subject  to  a  tree  

 

 
 
preservation  order  may  not  normally  be  topped,  lopped  or  felled  without  the  


consent   of   the   local   planning   authority.  
 
Unitary  Development  Plan  -  An  old-style  statutory  development  plan  prepared  

 


by  a  metropolitan  district  and  some  unitary  local  authorities,  which  contains  


policies  equivalent  to  those  in  both  a  structure  plan  and  local  plan.  These  plans  

 


will  continue  to  operate  for  a  time  after  the  commencement  of  the  new  


development   plan   system,   by   virtue   of   specific   transitional   provisions.  
 
Urban  Greening  Factor  -  A  planning  tool  to  identify  the  appropriate  amount  of  

  


urban   greening   required   in   new   major   developments.  
 
Use  Classes  -  The  Town  and  Country  Planning  (Use  Classes)  Order  1987  puts  
 
  


uses  of  land  and  buildings  into  various  categories.  Planning  permission  is  not  


needed   for   changes   of   use   within   the   same   use   class.  
 
Use  Classes  Order  -  a  piece  of  national  secondary  legislation  which  groups  

 


types  of  use  of  premises  into  classes,  so  that  no  development  is  involved  if  a  

  
building  is  changed  from  one  use  to  another  within  the  same  class.  The  Use  


Classes   Order   can   be   viewed   at   the   Planning   Portal   website:  
 
Vertical  gardens  -  Vertical  gardens  encompass  balconies,  roofs  and  walls  
 
  


planted  with  greenery,  which  mitigate  against  climate  change  by  reducing  air  


pollution  and  soaking  up  excess  rain  water.  They  improve  energy  efficiency  within  


buildings  by  limiting  wind  impact  and  heat  loss,  while  providing  green  biodiversity  


links   across   the   urban   space.  
 
Vision  Zero  -  The  Mayor  of  London  has  published  a  Vision  Zero  Action  Plan  for  
 
  

 


London.  The  actions  in  the  plan  will  reduce  road  danger  for  everyone  and  create  


streets  safe  for  walking  and  cycling.  The  Mayor's  aim  is  for  no  one  to  be  killed  in  

 

 
or  by  a  London  bus  by  2030,  and  for  all  deaths  and  serious  injuries  from  road  
 
  


collisions   to   be   eliminated   from  London's  streets   by   2041.  
 
Visitor  Economy  (also  see  Night  Time  Economy)  -  The  visitor  economy  

 


involves  those  activities  of  persons  travelling  to  and  staying  in  places  outside  their  

 


usual   environment   over   the   short   term  for   leisure,   business   or   other   purposes.
